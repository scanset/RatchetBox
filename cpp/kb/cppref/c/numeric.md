The C numerics library includes common mathematical functions and types, as well as support for random number generation.

### Common mathematical functions

The header <math.h> provides standard C library mathematical functions such as fabs, sqrt, and sin.

### Floating-point environment

The header <fenv.h> defines flags and functions related to exceptional floating-point state, such as overflow and division by zero.

### Pseudo-random number generation

The header <stdlib.h> also includes C-style random number generation via srand and rand.

### Complex number arithmetic

The header <complex.h> provides types and functions to work with complex numbers.

### Type-generic math

The header <tgmath.h> provides some macros for a function which names XXX:

- real function:

- float variant XXXf

- double variant XXX

- long double variant XXXl

- complex function:

- float variant cXXXf

- double variant cXXX

- long double variant cXXXl

### Bit manipulation (since C23)

The header <stdbit.h> provides macros and functions to work with the byte ordering and byte and bit representation of C objects.

### Checked integer arithmetic (since C23)

Provides some type-generic macros for checked integer arithmetic:

Defined in header <stdckdint.h> 

ckd_add

(C23)

checked addition operation on two integers
(type-generic function macro)

ckd_sub

(C23)

checked subtraction operation on two integers
(type-generic function macro)

ckd_mul

(C23)

checked multiplication operation on two integers
(type-generic function macro)
