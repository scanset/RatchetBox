Defined in header <time.h>

double difftime( time_t time_end, time_t time_beg );

Computes difference between two calendar times as time_t objects (time_end - time_beg) in seconds. If time_end refers to time point before time_beg then the result is negative.

### Parameters

time_beg, time_end

-

times to compare

### Return value

Difference between two times in seconds.

### Notes

On POSIX systems, time_t is measured in seconds, and difftime is equivalent to arithmetic subtraction, but C and C++ allow fractional units for time_t.

### Example

The following program computes the number of seconds that have passed since the beginning of the month.

Run this code

#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
 
int main(void)
{
time_t now = time(0);
 
struct tm beg = *localtime(&now);
 
// set beg to the beginning of the month
beg.tm_hour = 0,
beg.tm_min = 0,
beg.tm_sec = 0,
beg.tm_mday = 1;
 
double seconds = difftime(now, mktime(&beg));
 
printf("%.f seconds have passed since the beginning of the month.\n", seconds);
 
return 0;
}

Output:

1937968 seconds have passed since the beginning of the month.
