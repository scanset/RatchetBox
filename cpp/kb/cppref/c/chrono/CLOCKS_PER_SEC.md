Defined in header <time.h>

#define CLOCKS_PER_SEC /* implementation-defined */

Expands to an expression (not necessarily a compile-time constant) of type clock_t equal to the number of clock ticks per second, as returned by clock().

### Notes

POSIX defines CLOCKS_PER_SEC as 1'000'000, regardless of the actual precision of clock.

Until standardized as CLOCKS_PER_SEC in C89, this macro was sometimes known by its IEEE std 1003.1-1988 name CLK_TCK: that name was not included in C89 and was removed from POSIX itself in 1996 over ambiguity with _SC_CLK_TCK, which gives number of clocks per second for the function times).
