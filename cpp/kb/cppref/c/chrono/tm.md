Defined in header <time.h>

struct tm;

Structure holding a calendar date and time broken down into its components.

### Member objects

int tm_sec

seconds after the minute – [​0​, 61](until C99)[​0​, 60](since C99)[note 1] 
(public member object)

int tm_min

minutes after the hour – [​0​, 59] 
(public member object)

int tm_hour

hours since midnight – [​0​, 23] 
(public member object)

int tm_mday

day of the month – [1, 31] 
(public member object)

int tm_mon

months since January – [​0​, 11] 
(public member object)

int tm_year

years since 1900 
(public member object)

int tm_wday

days since Sunday – [​0​, 6] 
(public member object)

int tm_yday

days since January 1 – [​0​, 365] 
(public member object)

int tm_isdst

Daylight Saving Time flag. The value is positive if DST is in effect, zero if not and negative if no information is available 
(public member object)

#### Notes

The Standard mandates only the presence of the aforementioned members in either order. The implementations usually add more data-members to this structure.

- ↑ Range allows for a positive leap second. Two leap seconds in the same minute are not allowed (the C89 range 0..61 was a defect)

### Example

Run this code

#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
 
int main(void)
{
struct tm start = {.tm_year = 2022 - 1900, .tm_mday = 1};
mktime(&start);
printf("%s", asctime(&start)); // note implicit trailing '\n'
}

Output:

Sat Jan 1 00:00:00 2022
