Defined in header <threads.h>

int thrd_join( thrd_t thr, int *res );

(since C11)

Blocks the current thread until the thread identified by thr finishes execution.

If res is not a null pointer, the result code of the thread is put to the location pointed to by res.

The termination of the thread synchronizes-with the completion of this function.

The behavior is undefined if the thread was previously detached or joined by another thread.

### Parameters

thr

-

identifier of the thread to join

res

-

location to put the result code to

### Return value

thrd_success if successful, thrd_error otherwise.
