Defined in header <threads.h>

int mtx_lock( mtx_t* mutex );

(since C11)

Blocks the current thread until the mutex pointed to by mutex is locked.

The behavior is undefined if the current thread has already locked the mutex and the mutex is not recursive.

Prior calls to mtx_unlock on the same mutex synchronize-with this operation, and all lock/unlock operations on any given mutex form a single total order (similar to the modification order of an atomic)

### Parameters

mutex

-

pointer to the mutex to lock

### Return value

thrd_success if successful, thrd_error otherwise.
