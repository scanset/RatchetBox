Defined in header <threads.h>

int tss_create( tss_t* tss_key, tss_dtor_t destructor );

(since C11)

Creates new thread-specific storage key and stores it in the object pointed to by tss_key. Although the same key value may be used by different threads, the values bound to the key by tss_set are maintained on a per-thread basis and persist for the life of the calling thread.

The value NULL is associated with the newly created key in all existing threads, and upon thread creation, the values associated with all TSS keys is initialized to NULL.

If destructor is not a null pointer, then also associates the destructor which is called when the storage is released by thrd_exit (but not by tss_delete and not at program termination by exit).

A call to tss_create from within a thread-specific storage destructor results in undefined behavior.

### Parameters

tss_key

-

pointer to memory location to store the new thread-specific storage key

destructor

-

pointer to a function to call at thread exit

### Notes

The POSIX equivalent of this function is pthread_key_create.

### Return value

thrd_success if successful, thrd_error otherwise.

### Example

This section is incomplete
Reason: improve, perhaps look for POSIX examples for inspiration

int thread_func(void *arg) {
tss_t key;
if (thrd_success == tss_create(&key, free)) {
tss_set(key, malloc(4)); // stores a pointer on TSS
// ...
}
} // calls free() for the pointer stored on TSS
