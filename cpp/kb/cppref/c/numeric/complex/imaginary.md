Defined in header <complex.h>

#define imaginary _Imaginary

(since C99)

This macro expands to the keyword _Imaginary.

This is a convenience macro that makes it possible to use float imaginary, double imaginary, and long double imaginary as an alternative way to write the three pure imaginary C types float _Imaginary, double _Imaginary, and long double _Imaginary

As with any pure imaginary number support in C, this macro is only defined if the imaginary numbers are supported.

A compiler that defines __STDC_IEC_559_COMPLEX__ is not required to support imaginary numbers. POSIX recommends checking if the macro _Imaginary_I is defined to identify imaginary number support.

(since C99)
(until C11)

Imaginary numbers are supported if __STDC_IEC_559_COMPLEX__ is defined.

(since C11)

### Notes

Programs are allowed to undefine and perhaps redefine the imaginary macro.

To date, only Oracle C compiler is known to have implemented imaginary types.

### Example

Run this code

#include <stdio.h>
#include <complex.h>
 
int main(void)
{
double imaginary i = -2.0*I; // pure imaginary
double f = 1.0; // pure real
double complex z = f + i; // complex number
printf("z = %.1f%+.1fi\n", creal(z), cimag(z));
}

Output:

z = 1.0-2.0i
