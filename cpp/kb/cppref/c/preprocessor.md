The preprocessor is executed at translation phase 4, before the compilation. The result of preprocessing is a single file which is then passed to the actual compiler.

### Directives

The preprocessing directives control the behavior of the preprocessor. Each directive occupies one line and has the following format:

- # character

- preprocessing instruction (one of define, undef, include, if, ifdef, ifndef, else, elif, elifdef, elifndef(since C23), endif, line, embed(since C23), error, warning(since C23), pragma) [1]

- arguments (depends on the instruction)

- line break.

The null directive (# followed by a line break) is allowed and has no effect.

### Capabilities

The preprocessor has the source file translation capabilities:

- conditionally compile of parts of source file (controlled by directive #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #elif, #elifdef, #elifndef(since C23) and #endif).

- replace text macros while possibly concatenating or quoting identifiers (controlled by directives #define and #undef, and operators # and ##)

- include other files (controlled by directive #include and checked with __has_include(since C23))

- cause an error or warning(since C23) (controlled by directive #error or #warning respectively(since C23))

The following aspects of the preprocessor can be controlled:

- implementation defined behavior (controlled by directive #pragma and operator _Pragma(since C99))

- file name and line information available to the preprocessor (controlled by directives #line)

### Footnotes

- ↑ These are the directives defined by the standard. The standard does not define behavior for other directives: they might be ignored, have some useful meaning, or make the program ill-formed. Even if otherwise ignored, they are removed from the source code when the preprocessor is done. A common non-standard extension is the directive #warning which emits a user-defined message during compilation.(until C23)
