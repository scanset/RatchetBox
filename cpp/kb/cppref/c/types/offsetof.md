Defined in header <stddef.h>

#define offsetof(type, member) /*implementation-defined*/

The macro offsetof expands to an integer constant expression of type size_t, the value of which is the offset, in bytes, from the beginning of an object of specified type to its specified subobject, including padding if any.

Given an object o of type type with static storage duration, &(o.member) shall be an address constant expression and point to a subobject of o. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

If the type name specified in type contains a comma not between matching parentheses, the behavior is undefined.

(since C23)

### Notes

If offsetof is applied to a bit-field member, the behavior is undefined, because the address of a bit-field cannot be taken.

member is not restricted to a direct member. It can denote a subobject of a given member, such as an element of an array member.

Even though it is specified in C23 that specifying a new type containing an unparenthesized comma in offsetof is undefined behavior, such usage is generally not supported even in earlier modes: offsetof(struct Foo { int a, b; }, a) generally fails to compile.

typeof can be used to avoid the bad effect of commas in the definition of a new type, e.g. offsetof(typeof(struct { int i, j; }), i) is well-defined.

(since C23)

### Example

Run this code

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stddef.h>
 
struct S {
char c;
double d;
};
 
int main(void)
{
printf("the first element is at offset %zu\n", offsetof(struct S, c));
printf("the double is at offset %zu\n", offsetof(struct S, d));
}

Possible output:

the first element is at offset 0
the double is at offset 8
