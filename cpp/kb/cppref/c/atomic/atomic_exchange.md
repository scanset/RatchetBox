C atomic_exchange( volatile A* obj, C desired );

(1)
(since C11)

C atomic_exchange_explicit( volatile A* obj, C desired, memory_order order );

(2)
(since C11)

Atomically replaces the value pointed by obj with desired and returns the value obj held previously. The operation is read-modify-write operation. The first version orders memory accesses according to memory_order_seq_cst, the second version orders memory accesses according to order. 

This is a generic function defined for all atomic object types A. The argument is pointer to a volatile atomic type to accept addresses of both non-volatile and volatile (e.g. memory-mapped I/O) atomic objects, and volatile semantic is preserved when applying this operation to volatile atomic objects. C is the non-atomic type corresponding to A.

It is unspecified whether the name of a generic function is a macro or an identifier declared with external linkage. If a macro definition is suppressed in order to access an actual function (e.g. parenthesized like (atomic_exchange)(...)), or a program defines an external identifier with the name of a generic function, the behavior is undefined..

### Parameters

obj

-

pointer to the atomic object to modify

desired

-

the value to replace the atomic object with

order

-

the memory synchronization ordering for this operation: all values are permitted

### Return value

The value held previously be the atomic object pointed to by obj.
