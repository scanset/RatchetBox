Defined in header <stdatomic.h>

void atomic_thread_fence( memory_order order );

(since C11)

Establishes memory synchronization ordering of non-atomic and relaxed atomic accesses, as instructed by order, without an associated atomic operation. For example, all non-atomic and relaxed atomic stores that happen before a memory_order_release fence in thread A will be synchronized with non-atomic and relaxed atomic loads from the same locations made in thread B after an memory_order_acquire fence.

### Parameters

order

-

the memory ordering executed by this fence

### Return value

(none)
