Defined in header <stdatomic.h>

void atomic_init( volatile A* obj, C desired );

(since C11)

Initializes the default-constructed atomic object obj with the value desired. The function is not atomic: concurrent access from another thread, even through an atomic operation, is a data race.

This is a generic function defined for all atomic object types A. The argument is pointer to a volatile atomic type to accept addresses of both non-volatile and volatile (e.g. memory-mapped I/O) atomic objects, and volatile semantic is preserved when applying this operation to volatile atomic objects. C is the non-atomic type corresponding to A.

It is unspecified whether the name of a generic function is a macro or an identifier declared with external linkage. If a macro definition is suppressed in order to access an actual function (e.g. parenthesized like (atomic_init)(...)), or a program defines an external identifier with the name of a generic function, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

obj

-

pointer to an atomic object to initialize

desired

-

the value to initialize atomic object with

### Return value

(none)

### Notes

atomic_init is the only way to initialize dynamically-allocated atomic objects. For example:

_Atomic int *p = malloc(sizeof(_Atomic int));
atomic_init(p, 42);
