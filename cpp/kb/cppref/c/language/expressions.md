An expression is a sequence of operators and their operands, that specifies a computation.

Expression evaluation may produce a result (e.g., evaluation of 2 + 2 produces the result 4), may generate side-effects (e.g. evaluation of printf("%d", 4) sends the character '4' to the standard output stream), and may designate objects or functions.

#### General

- value categories (lvalue, non-lvalue object, function designator) classify expressions by their values

- order of evaluation of arguments and subexpressions specifies the order in which intermediate results are obtained

### Operators

Common operators

assignment

increment

other

a = b

a -= b

a *= b

a /= b

a %= b

a &= b

a |= b

a ^= b

a <<= b

a >>= b

++a

--a

a++

a--

+a

-a

a + b

a - b

a * b

a / b

a % b

~a

a & b

a | b

a ^ b

a << b

a >> b

!a

a && b

a | b

a == b

a != b

a < b

a > b

a <= b

a >= b

a[b]

*a

&a

a->b

a.b

a(...)

a, b

(type) a

a ? b : c

sizeof

_Alignof
(since C11)

(since C23)

- operator precedence defines the order in which operators are bound to their arguments

- alternative representations are alternative spellings for some operators

#### Conversions

- Implicit conversions take place when types of operands do not match the expectations of operators

- Casts may be used to explicitly convert values from one type to another.

#### Other

- constant expressions can be evaluated at compile time and used in compile-time context (non-VLA(since C99)array sizes, static initializers, etc)

- generic selections can execute different expressions depending on the types of the arguments

(since C11)

- Floating-point arithmetic may raise exceptions and report errors as specified in math_errhandling

- The standard #pragmas FENV_ACCESS, FP_CONTRACT, and CX_LIMITED_RANGE as well as the floating-point evaluation precision and rounding direction control the way floating-point arithmetic are executed.

(since C99)

### Primary expressions

The operands of any operator may be other expressions or they may be primary expressions (e.g. in 1 + 2 * 3, the operands of operator+ are the subexpression 2 * 3 and the primary expression 1).

Primary expressions are any of the following:

1) Constants and literals (e.g. 2 or "Hello, world")

2) Suitably declared identifiers (e.g. n or printf)

3) Generic selections

(since C11)

Any expression in parentheses is also classified as a primary expression: this guarantees that the parentheses have higher precedence than any operator.

#### Constants and literals

Constant values of certain types may be embedded in the source code of a C program using specialized expressions known as literals (for lvalue expressions) and constants (for non-lvalue expressions)

- integer constants are decimal, octal, or hexadecimal numbers of integer type.

- character constants are individual characters of type int suitable for conversion to a character type or of type char8_t,(since C23) char16_t, char32_t, or(since C11) wchar_t

- floating constants are values of type float, double, or long double

- predefined constants true/false are values of type bool

- predefined constant nullptr is a value of type nullptr_t

(since C23)

- string literals are sequences of characters of type char[], char8_t[](since C23), char16_t[], char32_t[],(since C11) or wchar_t[] that represent null-terminated strings

- compound literals are values of struct, union, or array type directly embedded in program code

(since C99)

### Unevaluated expressions

The operands of the sizeof operator are expressions that are not evaluated (unless they are VLAs)(since C99). Thus, size_t n = sizeof(printf("%d", 4)); does not perform console output.

The operands of the _Alignof(until C23)alignof(since C23) operator, the controlling expression of a generic selection, and size expressions of VLAs that are operands of _Alignof(until C23)alignof(since C23) are also expressions that are not evaluated.

(since C11)
