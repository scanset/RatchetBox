Logical operators apply standard boolean algebra operations to their operands.

Operator

Operator name

Example

Result

!

logical NOT

!a

the logical negation of a

&&

logical AND

a && b

the logical AND of a and b

logical OR

a | b

the logical OR of a and b

### Logical NOT

The logical NOT expression has the form 

! expression

where 

expression

-

an expression of any scalar type

The logical NOT operator has type int. Its value is ​0​ if expression evaluates to a value that compares unequal to zero. Its value is 1 if expression evaluates to a value that compares equal to zero. (so !E is the same as (0==E))

Run this code

#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
int main(void)
{
bool b = !(2+2 == 4); // not true
printf("!(2+2==4) = %s\n", b ? "true" : "false");
 
int n = isspace('a'); // non-zero if 'a' is a space, zero otherwise
int x = !!n; // "bang-bang", common C idiom for mapping integers to [0,1]
// (all non-zero values become 1)
char *a[2] = {"non-space", "space"};
puts(a[x]); // now x can be safely used as an index to array of 2 strings
}

Output:

!(2+2==4) = false
non-space

### Logical AND

The logical AND expression has the form 

lhs && rhs

where 

lhs

-

an expression of any scalar type

rhs

-

an expression of any scalar type, which is only evaluated if lhs does not compare equal to ​0​

The logical-AND operator has type int and the value 1 if both lhs and rhs compare unequal to zero. It has the value ​0​ otherwise (if either lhs or rhs or both compare equal to zero).

There is a sequence point after the evaluation of lhs. If the result of lhs compares equal to zero, then rhs is not evaluated at all (so-called short-circuit evaluation)

Run this code

#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
bool b = 2+2==4 && 2*2==4; // b == true
 
1 > 2 && puts("this won't print");
 
char *p = "abc";
if(p && *p) // common C idiom: if p is not null
// AND if p does not point at the end of the string
{ // (note that thanks to short-circuit evaluation, this
// will not attempt to dereference a null pointer)
// ... // ... then do some string processing
}
}

### Logical OR

The logical OR expression has the form 

lhs | rhs

where 

lhs

-

an expression of any scalar type

rhs

-

an expression of any scalar type, which is only evaluated if lhs compares equal to ​0​

The logical-OR operator has type int and the value 1 if either lhs or rhs compare unequal to zero. It has value ​0​ otherwise (if both lhs and rhs compare equal to zero).

There is a sequence point after the evaluation of lhs. If the result of lhs compares unequal to zero, then rhs is not evaluated at all (so-called short-circuit evaluation)

Run this code

#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <errno.h>
int main(void)
{
bool b = 2+2 == 4 | 2+2 == 5; // true
printf("true or false = %s\n", b ? "true" : "false");
 
// logical OR can be used simialar to perl's "or die", as long as rhs has scalar type
fopen("test.txt", "r") | printf("could not open test.txt: %s\n", strerror(errno));
}

Possible output:

true or false = true
could not open test.txt: No such file or directory
