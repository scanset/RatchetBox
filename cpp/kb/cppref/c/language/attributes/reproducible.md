Provides the compiler with information about the access of objects by a function such that certain properties of function calls can be deduced.

### Syntax

[[ unsequenced ]]
[[ __unsequenced__ ]]

(1)

[[ reproducible ]]
[[ __reproducible__ ]]

(2)

1) Indicates that a function is effectless, idempotent, stateless, and independent.

2) Indicates that a function is effectless and idempotent.

### Explanation

These attributes apply to a function declarator or to a type specifier that has a function type. The corresponding attribute is a property of the function type.

#### Effectless

An evaluation of a function call is effectless if any store operation
that is sequenced during the call is the modification of an object that synchronizes with the call; if additionally the operation is observable, all access to the object must be based on a unique pointer parameter of the function.

#### Idempotent

An evaluation E is idempotent if a second evaluation of E can be sequenced immediately after the original one without changing the resulting value, if any, or the observable state of the execution.

#### Stateless

A function F is stateless if any definition of an object of static or thread storage duration in F or in a function that is called by F is const but not volatile qualified.

#### Independent

A function F is independent if for any object X that is observed by a call to F
through an lvalue that is not based on a parameter of the call, all accesses to X in all calls to F during the same program execution observe the same value;
otherwise if the access is based on a pointer parameter, there shall be a unique such pointer parameter P such that any access to X shall be to an lvalue that is based on P.

An object X is observed by a function call if both synchronize, if X is not local to the call, if X has a lifetime that starts before the function call, and if an access of X is sequenced during the call; the last value of X, if any, that is stored before the call is said to be the value of X that is observed by the call.

### Notes

These attributes exist for the purpose of compiler optimization.

If a function is reproducible, multiple subsequent calls can be treated as a single call.

If a function is unsequenced, multiple subsequent calls can be treated as a single call, and the calls can be parallelized and reordered arbitrarily.
