Determines the type of an object.

### Syntax

typeof( type )

(1)

typeof( expression )

(2)

typeof_unqual( type )

(3)

typeof_unqual( expression )

(4)

### Explanation

1) produces the type-name with any nested typeof-specifier evaluated 

2) yields the type-name representing the type of its operand. No implicit conversions are applied to expression.

3,4) the same as (1) and (2) respectively but remove qualifiers

### Notes

typeof and typeof_unqual are collectively called the typeof operators. The typeof operators cannot be applied to bit-field members. If the type of the operand is a variably modified type, the operand is evaluated; otherwise, the operand is not evaluated. The result of the typeof_unqual operator is the non-atomic unqualified type that would result from the typeof operator. The typeof operator preserves all qualifiers.
