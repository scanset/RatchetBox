Defined in header <stdlib.h>

void abort_handler_s( const char * restrict msg,

                      void * restrict ptr,

                      errno_t error

);

(since C11)

Writes an implementation-defined message to stderr which must include the string pointed to by msg and calls abort().

A pointer to this function can be passed to set_constraint_handler_s to establish a runtime constraints violation handler.

As with all bounds-checked functions, abort_handler_s is only guaranteed to be available if __STDC_LIB_EXT1__ is defined by the implementation and if the user defines __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ to the integer constant 1 before including <stdlib.h>.

### Parameters

msg

-

pointer to the message written to the standard error stream

ptr

-

pointer to an implementation-defined object or a null pointer. Examples of implementation-defined objects are objects that give the name of the function that detected the violation and the line number when the violation was detected

error

-

a positive value of type errno_t

### Return value

none; this function does not return to its caller

### Notes

If set_constraint_handler_s is never called, the default handler is implementation-defined: it may be abort_handler_s, ignore_handler_s, or some other implementation-defined handler.

### Example

Run this code

#define __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ 1
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
 
int main(void)
{
#ifdef __STDC_LIB_EXT1__
char dst[2];
set_constraint_handler_s(ignore_handler_s);
int r = strcpy_s(dst, sizeof dst, "Too long!");
printf("dst = \"%s\", r = %d\n", dst, r);
set_constraint_handler_s(abort_handler_s);
r = strcpy_s(dst, sizeof dst, "Too long!");
printf("dst = \"%s\", r = %d\n", dst, r);
#endif
}

Possible output:

dst = "", r = 22
abort_handler_s was called in response to a runtime-constraint violation.
 
The runtime-constraint violation was caused by the following expression in strcpy_s:
(s1max <= (s2_len=strnlen_s(s2, s1max)) ) (in string_s.c:62)
 
Note to end users: This program was terminated as a result
of a bug present in the software. Please reach out to your
software's vendor to get more help.
