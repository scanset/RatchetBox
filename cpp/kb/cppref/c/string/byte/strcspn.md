Defined in header <string.h>

size_t strcspn( const char *dest, const char *src );

Returns the length of the maximum initial segment of the null-terminated byte string pointed to by dest, that consists of only the characters not found in the null-terminated byte string pointed to by src.

The behavior is undefined if either dest or src is not a pointer to a null-terminated byte string.

### Parameters

dest

-

pointer to the null-terminated byte string to be analyzed

src

-

pointer to the null-terminated byte string that contains the characters to search for

### Return value

The length of the maximum initial segment that contains only characters not found in the null-terminated byte string pointed to by src

### Notes

The function name stands for "complementary span" because the function searches for characters not found in src, that is the complement of src.

### Example

Run this code

#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(void)
{
const char *string = "abcde312$#@";
const char *invalid = "*$#";
 
size_t valid_len = strcspn(string, invalid);
if(valid_len != strlen(string))
printf("'%s' contains invalid chars starting at position %zu\n",
string, valid_len);
}

Output:

'abcde312$#@' contains invalid chars starting at position 8
