Defined in header <string.h>

char* strchr( const char* str, int ch );

(1)

/*QChar*/ *strchr( /*QChar*/ *str, int ch );

(2)
(since C23)

1) Finds the first occurrence of ch (after conversion to char as if by (char)ch) in the null-terminated byte string pointed to by str (each character interpreted as unsigned char). The terminating null character is considered to be a part of the string and can be found when searching for '\0'.

2) Type-generic function equivalent to (1). Let T be an unqualified character object type.

- If str is of type const T*, the return type is const char*.

- Otherwise, if str is of type T*, the return type is char*.

- Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

If a macro definition of each of these generic functions is suppressed to access an actual function (e.g. if (strchr) or a function pointer is used), the actual function declaration (1) becomes visible.

The behavior is undefined if str is not a pointer to a null-terminated byte string.

### Parameters

str

-

pointer to the null-terminated byte string to be analyzed

ch

-

character to search for

### Return value

Pointer to the found character in str, or null pointer if no such character is found.

### Example

Run this code

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
 
int main(void)
{
const char *str = "Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.";
char target = 'T';
const char* result = str;
 
while((result = strchr(result, target)) != NULL)
{
printf("Found '%c' starting at '%s'\n", target, result);
++result; // Increment result, otherwise we'll find target at the same location
}
}

Output:

Found 'T' starting at 'Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.'
Found 'T' starting at 'There is no try.'
