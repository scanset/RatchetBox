Defined in header <string.h>

size_t strspn( const char* dest, const char* src );

Returns the length of the maximum initial segment (span) of the null-terminated byte string pointed to by dest, that consists of only the characters found in the null-terminated byte string pointed to by src.

The behavior is undefined if either dest or src is not a pointer to a null-terminated byte string.

### Parameters

dest

-

pointer to the null-terminated byte string to be analyzed

src

-

pointer to the null-terminated byte string that contains the characters to search for

### Return value

The length of the maximum initial segment that contains only characters from the null-terminated byte string pointed to by src.

### Example

Run this code

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
 
int main(void)
{
const char* string = "abcde312$#@";
const char* low_alpha = "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm";
 
size_t spnsz = strspn(string, low_alpha);
printf("After skipping initial lowercase letters from '%s'\n"
"The remainder is '%s'\n", string, string + spnsz);
}

Output:

After skipping initial lowercase letters from 'abcde312$#@'
The remainder is '312$#@'
