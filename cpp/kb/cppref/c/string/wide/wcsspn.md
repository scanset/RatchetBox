Defined in header <wchar.h>

size_t wcsspn( const wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src );

(since C95)

Returns the length of the maximum initial segment of the wide string pointed to by dest, that consists of only the characters found in wide string pointed to by src.

### Parameters

dest

-

pointer to the null-terminated wide string to be analyzed

src

-

pointer to the null-terminated wide string that contains the characters to search for

### Return value

The length of the maximum initial segment that contains only characters from wide string pointed to by src

### Example

Run this code

#include <locale.h>
#include <wchar.h>
 
int main(void)
{
wchar_t dest[] = L"白猫 黑狗 甲虫";
const wchar_t src[] = L" 狗猫 白黑 ";
const size_t len = wcsspn(dest, src);
dest[len] = L'\0'; /* terminates the segment to print it out */
 
setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
wprintf(L"The length of maximum initial segment is %td.\n"
L"The segment is \"%ls\".\n", len, dest);
}

Output:

The length of maximum initial segment is 6.
The segment is "白猫 黑狗 ".
