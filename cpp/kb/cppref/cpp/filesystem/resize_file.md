Defined in header <filesystem>

void resize_file( const std::filesystem::path& p,

                  std::uintmax_t new_size );

(1)
(since C++17)

void resize_file( const std::filesystem::path& p,

                  std::uintmax_t new_size,

std::error_code& ec ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++17)

Changes the size of the regular file named by p as if by POSIX truncate: if the file size was previously larger than new_size, the remainder of the file is discarded. If the file was previously smaller than new_size, the file size is increased and the new area appears as if zero-filled.

### Parameters

p

-

path to resize

new_size

-

size that the file will now have

ec

-

out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

Any overload not marked noexcept may throw std::bad_alloc if memory allocation fails.

1) Throws std::filesystem::filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with p as the first path argument and the OS error code as the error code argument.

2) Sets a std::error_code& parameter to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur.

### Notes

On systems that support sparse files, increasing the file size does not increase the space it occupies on the file system: space allocation takes place only when non-zero bytes are written to the file.

### Example

Demonstrates the effect creating a sparse file has on the free space.

Run this code

#include <filesystem>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
auto p = std::filesystem::temp_directory_path() / "example.bin";
std::ofstream{p}.put('a');
std::cout.imbue(std::locale{"en_US.UTF8"});
std::cout << "File size: " << std::filesystem::file_size(p) << '\n'
<< "Free space: " << std::filesystem::space(p).free << '\n';
std::filesystem::resize_file(p, 64*1024); // resize to 64 KB
std::cout << "File size: " << std::filesystem::file_size(p) << '\n'
<< "Free space: " << std::filesystem::space(p).free << '\n';
std::filesystem::remove(p);
}

Possible output:

File size: 1
Free space: 42,954,108,928
File size: 65,536
Free space: 42,954,108,928
