friend bool operator==( const file_status& lhs, const file_status& rhs ) noexcept;

(since C++20)

Checks if two file_status values are equal, i.e. types and permissions represented by them are same respectively.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::filesystem::file_status is an associated class of the arguments.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

### Parameters

-

### Return value

lhs.type() == rhs.type() && lhs.permissions() == rhs.permissions()
