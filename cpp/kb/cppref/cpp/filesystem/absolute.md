Defined in header <filesystem>

path absolute( const std::filesystem::path& p );

(1)
(since C++17)

path absolute( const std::filesystem::path& p, std::error_code& ec );

(2)
(since C++17)

Returns a path referencing the same file system location as p, for which filesystem::path::is_absolute() is true.

2) This non-throwing overload returns default-constructed path if an error occurs.

### Parameters

p

-

path to convert to absolute form

ec

-

out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload

### Return value

Returns an absolute (although not necessarily canonical) pathname referencing the same file as p.

### Exceptions

Any overload not marked noexcept may throw std::bad_alloc if memory allocation fails.

1) Throws std::filesystem::filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with p as the first path argument and the OS error code as the error code argument.

2) Sets a std::error_code& parameter to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur.

### Notes

Implementations are encouraged to not consider p not existing to be an error.

For POSIX-based operating systems, std::filesystem::absolute(p) is equivalent to std::filesystem::current_path() / p except for when p is the empty path.

For Windows, std::filesystem::absolute may be implemented as a call to GetFullPathNameW.

### Example

Run this code

#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
std::filesystem::path p = "foo.c";
std::cout << "Current path is " << std::filesystem::current_path() << '\n';
std::cout << "Absolute path for " << p << " is " << fs::absolute(p) << '\n';
}

Possible output:

Current path is "/tmp/1666297965.0051296"
Absolute path for "foo.c" is "/tmp/1666297965.0051296/foo.c"
