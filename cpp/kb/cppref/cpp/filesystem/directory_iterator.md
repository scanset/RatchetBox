Defined in header <filesystem>

class directory_iterator;

(since C++17)

directory_iterator is a LegacyInputIterator that iterates over the directory_entry elements of a directory (but does not visit the subdirectories). The iteration order is unspecified, except that each directory entry is visited only once. The special pathnames dot and dot-dot are skipped.

If the directory_iterator reports an error or is advanced past the last directory entry, it becomes equal to the default-constructed iterator, also known as the end iterator. Two end iterators are always equal, dereferencing or incrementing the end iterator is undefined behavior.

If a file or a directory is deleted or added to the directory tree after the directory iterator has been created, it is unspecified whether the change would be observed through the iterator.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a directory iterator 
(public member function)

(destructor)

default destructor 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns contents 
(public member function)

operator*operator->

accesses the pointed-to entry 
(public member function)

incrementoperator++

advances to the next entry 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

begin(std::filesystem::directory_iterator)end(std::filesystem::directory_iterator)

(C++17)

range-based for loop support 
(function)

Additionally, operator== and operator!= are(until C++20)operator== is(since C++20) provided as required by LegacyInputIterator.

It is unspecified whether operator!= is provided because it can be synthesized from operator==, and(since C++20) whether an equality operator is a member or non-member.

### Helper specializations

template<>

constexpr bool 

ranges::enable_borrowed_range<std::filesystem::directory_iterator> = true;

(since C++20)

template<>

constexpr bool 

ranges::enable_view<std::filesystem::directory_iterator> = true;

(since C++20)

These specializations for directory_iterator make it a borrowed_range and a view.

### Notes

Many low-level OS APIs for directory traversal retrieve file attributes along with the next directory entry. The constructors and the non-const member functions of std::filesystem::directory_iterator store these attributes, if any, in the pointed-to std::filesystem::directory_entry without calling directory_entry::refresh, which makes it possible to examine the attributes of the directory entries as they are being iterated over, without making additional system calls.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <filesystem>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
const std::filesystem::path sandbox{"sandbox"};
std::filesystem::create_directories(sandbox/"dir1"/"dir2");
std::ofstream{sandbox/"file1.txt"};
std::ofstream{sandbox/"file2.txt"};
 
std::cout << "directory_iterator:\n";
// directory_iterator can be iterated using a range-for loop
for (auto const& dir_entry : std::filesystem::directory_iterator{sandbox}) 
std::cout << dir_entry.path() << '\n';
 
std::cout << "\ndirectory_iterator as a range:\n";
// directory_iterator behaves as a range in other ways, too
std::ranges::for_each(
std::filesystem::directory_iterator{sandbox},
[](const auto& dir_entry) { std::cout << dir_entry << '\n'; });
 
std::cout << "\nrecursive_directory_iterator:\n";
for (auto const& dir_entry : std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator{sandbox}) 
std::cout << dir_entry << '\n';
 
// delete the sandbox dir and all contents within it, including subdirs
std::filesystem::remove_all(sandbox);
}

Possible output:

directory_iterator:
"sandbox/file2.txt"
"sandbox/file1.txt"
"sandbox/dir1"
 
directory_iterator as a range:
"sandbox/file2.txt"
"sandbox/file1.txt"
"sandbox/dir1"
 
recursive_directory_iterator:
"sandbox/file2.txt"
"sandbox/file1.txt"
"sandbox/dir1"
"sandbox/dir1/dir2"
