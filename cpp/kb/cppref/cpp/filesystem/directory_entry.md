class directory_entry;

(since C++17)

Represents a directory entry. The object stores a path as a member and may also store additional file attributes (hard link count, status, symlink status, file size, and last write time) during directory iteration.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a directory entry 
(public member function)

(destructor)

default destructor 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

operator=

assigns contents 
(public member function)

assign

assigns contents 
(public member function)

replace_filename

sets the filename 
(public member function)

refresh

updates the cached file attributes 
(public member function)

#### Observers

returns the path the entry refers to 
(public member function)

exists

checks whether directory entry refers to existing file system object 
(public member function)

is_block_file

checks whether the directory entry refers to block device 
(public member function)

is_character_file

checks whether the directory entry refers to a character device 
(public member function)

is_directory

checks whether the directory entry refers to a directory 
(public member function)

is_fifo

checks whether the directory entry refers to a named pipe 
(public member function)

is_other

checks whether the directory entry refers to an other file 
(public member function)

is_regular_file

checks whether the directory entry refers to a regular file 
(public member function)

is_socket

checks whether the directory entry refers to a named IPC socket 
(public member function)

is_symlink

checks whether the directory entry refers to a symbolic link 
(public member function)

file_size

returns the size of the file to which the directory entry refers 
(public member function)

hard_link_count

returns the number of hard links referring to the file to which the directory entry refers 
(public member function)

last_write_time

gets the time of the last data modification of the file to which the directory entry refers 
(public member function)

statussymlink_status

status of the file designated by this directory entry;
status of the file/symlink designated by this directory entry 
(public member function)

operator==operator!=operator<operator<=operator>operator>=operator<=>

(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(C++20)

compares two directory entries 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator<<

performs stream output on a directory entry 
(function)
