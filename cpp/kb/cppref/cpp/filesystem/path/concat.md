(8)
(since C++17)

Concatenates the current path and the argument

1-3,6,7) Appends path(p).native() to the pathname stored in *this in the native format. This directly manipulates the value of native() and may not be portable between operating systems.

4,5) Same as return *this += std::basic_string_view(&x, 1);.

8) Same as return *this += path(first, last);.

(6) and (7) participate in overload resolution only if Source and path are not the same type, and either:

- Source is a specialization of std::basic_string or std::basic_string_view, or

- std::iterator_traits<std::decay_t<Source>>::value_type is valid and denotes a possibly const-qualified encoding character type (char, char8_t, (since C++20)char16_t, char32_t, or wchar_t).

### Parameters

p

-

path to append

str

-

string or string view to append

ptr

-

pointer to the beginning of a null-terminated string to append

x

-

single character to append

source

-

std::basic_string, std::basic_string_view, null-terminated multicharacter string, or an input iterator pointing to a null-terminated multicharacter sequence, which represents a path name (either in portable or in native format)

first, last

-

pair of LegacyInputIterators that specify a multicharacter sequence that represents a path name

Type requirements

-

InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

-

The value type of InputIt must be one of the encoded character types (char, wchar_t, char16_t and char32_t).

-

CharT must be one of the encoded character types (char, wchar_t, char16_t and char32_t).

### Return value

*this

### Exceptions

May throw std::bad_alloc if memory allocation fails.

### Notes

Unlike with append() or operator/=, additional directory separators are never introduced.

### Example

Run this code

#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::filesystem::path p1; // an empty path
p1 += "var"; // does not insert a separator
std::cout << R"("" + "var" --> )" << p1 << '\n';
p1 += "lib"; // does not insert a separator
std::cout << R"("var" + "lib" --> )" << p1 << '\n';
auto str = std::string{"1234567"};
p1.concat(std::begin(str) + 3, std::end(str) - 1);
std::cout << "p1.concat --> " << p1 << '\n';
}

Output:

"" + "var" --> "var"
"var" + "lib" --> "varlib"
p1.concat --> "varlib456"
