path parent_path() const;

(since C++17)

Returns the path to the parent directory.

If has_relative_path() returns false, the result is a copy of *this.
Otherwise, the result is a path whose generic format pathname is the longest prefix of the generic format pathname of *this that produces one fewer element in its iteration.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The path to the parent directory, or a copy of *this if not has_relative_path().

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions. 

### Example

Run this code

#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
for (fs::path p : {"/var/tmp/example.txt", "/", "/var/tmp/."})
std::cout << "The parent path of " << p
<< " is " << p.parent_path() << '\n';
}

Possible output:

The parent path of "/var/tmp/example.txt" is "/var/tmp"
The parent path of "/" is "/"
The parent path of "/var/tmp/." is "/var/tmp"
