template< class CharT, class Traits >

friend std::basic_istream<CharT,Traits>&

operator>>( std::basic_istream<CharT,Traits>& is, path& p );

(2)
(since C++17)

Performs stream input or output on the path p. std::quoted is used so that spaces do not cause truncation when later read by stream input operator.

These function templates are not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::filesystem::path is an associated class of the arguments. This prevents undesirable conversions in the presence of a using namespace std::filesystem; using-directive.

### Parameters

os

-

stream to perform output on

is

-

stream to perform input on

p

-

path to insert or extract

### Return value

1) os

2) is

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions. 

### Possible implementation

operator<<

template<class CharT, class Traits>
friend std::basic_ostream<CharT,Traits>&
operator<<(std::basic_ostream<CharT,Traits>& os, const path& p)
{
os << std::quoted(p.string<CharT,Traits>());
return os;
}

operator>>

template<class CharT, class Traits>
friend std::basic_istream<CharT,Traits>&
operator>>(std::basic_istream<CharT,Traits>& is, path& p)
{
std::basic_string<CharT, Traits> t;
is >> std::quoted(t);
p = t;
return is;
}

### Example

Run this code

#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::cout << std::filesystem::current_path() << '\n';
std::cout << std::filesystem::temp_directory_path() << '\n';
}

Possible output:

"/home/user"
"/tmp"
