friend path operator/( const path& lhs, const path& rhs );

(since C++17)

Concatenates two path components using the preferred directory separator if appropriate (see operator/= for details).

Effectively returns path(lhs) /= rhs.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::filesystem::path is an associated class of the arguments. This prevents undesirable conversions in the presence of a using namespace std::filesystem; using-directive.

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

paths to concatenate

### Return value

The result of path concatenation.

### Example

Run this code

#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
# if defined(_WIN32) // see e.g. stackoverflow.com/questions/142508
 
std::filesystem::path p = "C:";
 
std::cout << "\"C:\" / \"Users\" / \"batman\" == " << p / "Users" / "batman" << '\n';
 
# else // __linux__ etc
 
std::filesystem::path p = "/home";
 
std::cout << "\"/home\" / \"tux\" / \".fonts\" == " << p / "tux" / ".fonts" << '\n';
 
# endif
}

Possible output:

Windows specific output:
"C:" / "Users" / "batman" == "C:Users\\batman"
 
Linux etc specific output:
"/home" / "tux" / ".fonts" == "/home/tux/.fonts"
