Checks whether the path is absolute or relative. An absolute path is a path that unambiguously identifies the location of a file without reference to an additional starting location. The first version returns true if the path, in native format, is absolute, false otherwise; the second version the other way round.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

1) true if the path is absolute, false otherwise.

2) false if the path is absolute, true otherwise.

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions. 

### Notes

The path "/" is absolute on a POSIX OS, but is relative on Windows.
