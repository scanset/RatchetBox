void refresh();

(1)
(since C++17)

void refresh( std::error_code& ec ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++17)

Examines the filesystem object referred to by this directory entry and stores its attributes for retrieval with status, exists, is_regular_file, and other status accessors.

If an error occurs, the value of any cached attributes is unspecified.

### Parameters

ec

-

out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

Any overload not marked noexcept may throw std::bad_alloc if memory allocation fails.

1) Throws std::filesystem::filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with p as the first path argument and the OS error code as the error code argument.

2) Sets a std::error_code& parameter to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur.

### Notes

Many low-level OS APIs for directory traversal retrieve file attributes along with the next directory entry. The constructors and the non-const member functions of std::filesystem::directory_iterator store these attributes, if any, in the pointed-to std::filesystem::directory_entry without calling directory_entry::refresh, which makes it possible to examine the attributes of the directory entries as they are being iterated over, without making additional system calls.
