(since C++17)

void copy_symlink( const std::filesystem::path& from,

                   const std::filesystem::path& to,

std::error_code& ec ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++17)

Copies a symlink to another location.

1) Effectively calls f(read_symlink(from), to) where f is create_symlink or create_directory_symlink depending on whether from resolves to a file or directory.

2) Effectively calls f(read_symlink(from, ec), to, ec) where f is create_symlink or create_directory_symlink depending on whether from resolves to a file or directory.

### Parameters

from

-

path to a symbolic link to copy

to

-

destination path of the new symlink

ec

-

out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

Any overload not marked noexcept may throw std::bad_alloc if memory allocation fails.

1) Throws std::filesystem::filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with from as the first path argument, to as the second path argument, and the OS error code as the error code argument.

2) Sets a std::error_code& parameter to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur.
