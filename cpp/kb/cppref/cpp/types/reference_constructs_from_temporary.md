Defined in header <type_traits>

template< class T, class U >

struct reference_constructs_from_temporary;

(since C++23)

Let V be std::remove_cv_t<U> if U is a scalar type or cv void, or U otherwise. If T is a reference type, and given a hypothetic expression e such that decltype(e) is V, the variable definition T ref(e); is well-formed and binds a temporary object to ref, then provides the member constant value equal to true. Otherwise, value is false.

If T is an lvalue reference type to a const- but not volatile-qualified object type or an rvalue reference type, both std::remove_reference_t<T> and std::remove_reference_t<U> shall be complete types, cv void, or an arrays of unknown bound; otherwise the behavior is undefined.

If an instantiation of a template above depends, directly or indirectly, on an incomplete type, and that instantiation could yield a different result if that type were hypothetically completed, the behavior is undefined.

If the program adds specializations for std::reference_constructs_from_temporary or std::reference_constructs_from_temporary_v, the behavior is undefined.

### Helper variable template

template< class T, class U >

inline constexpr bool reference_constructs_from_temporary_v =

std::reference_constructs_from_temporary<T, U>::value;

(since C++23)

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

true if T is a reference type, a U value can be bound to T in direct-initialization, and a temporary object would be bound to the reference, false otherwise 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator bool

converts the object to bool, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)

### Notes

std::reference_constructs_from_temporary can be used for rejecting some cases that always produce dangling references.

It is also possible to use member initializer list to reject binding a temporary object to a reference if the compiler has implemented CWG1696.

### Example

Run this code

#include <type_traits>
 
static_assert(std::reference_constructs_from_temporary_v<int&&, int> == true);
static_assert(std::reference_constructs_from_temporary_v<const int&, int> == true);
static_assert(std::reference_constructs_from_temporary_v<int&&, int&&> == false);
static_assert(std::reference_constructs_from_temporary_v<const int&, int&&> == false);
static_assert(std::reference_constructs_from_temporary_v<int&&, long&&> == true);
static_assert(std::reference_constructs_from_temporary_v<int&&, long> == true);
 
int main() {}
