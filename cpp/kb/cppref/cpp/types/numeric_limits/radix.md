static const int radix;

(until C++11)

static constexpr int radix;

(since C++11)

The value of std::numeric_limits<T>::radix is the base of the number system used in the representation of the type. It is 2 for all binary numeric types, but it may be, for example, 10 for IEEE 754 decimal floating-point types or for third-party binary-coded decimal integers. This constant is meaningful for all specializations.
