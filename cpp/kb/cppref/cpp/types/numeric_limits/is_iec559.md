static const bool is_iec559;

(until C++11)

static constexpr bool is_iec559;

(since C++11)

The value of std::numeric_limits<T>::is_iec559 is true for all floating-point types T which fulfill the requirements of IEC 559 (IEEE 754) standard. If std::numeric_limits<T>::is_iec559 is true, then std::numeric_limits<T>::has_infinity, std::numeric_limits<T>::has_quiet_NaN, and std::numeric_limits<T>::has_signaling_NaN are also true.
