static const bool has_infinity;

(until C++11)

static constexpr bool has_infinity;

(since C++11)

The value of std::numeric_limits<T>::has_infinity is true for all types T capable of representing the positive infinity as a distinct special value. This constant is meaningful for all floating-point types and is guaranteed to be true if std::numeric_limits<T>::is_iec559 == true.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <limits>
 
int main()
{
std::cout << std::boolalpha
<< std::numeric_limits<int>::has_infinity << '\n'
<< std::numeric_limits<long>::has_infinity << '\n'
<< std::numeric_limits<float>::has_infinity << '\n'
<< std::numeric_limits<double>::has_infinity << '\n';
}

Possible output:

false
false
true
true
