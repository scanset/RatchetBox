Defined in header <type_traits>

template< class T >

struct alignment_of;

(since C++11)

Provides the member constant value equal to the alignment requirement of the type T, as if obtained by an alignof expression. If T is an array type, returns the alignment requirements of the element type. If T is a reference type, returns the alignment requirements of the type referred to.

If alignof(T) is not a valid expression, the behavior is undefined.

If the program adds specializations for std::alignment_of or std::alignment_of_v(since C++17), the behavior is undefined.

### Helper variable template 

template< class T >

constexpr std::size_t alignment_of_v = alignment_of<T>::value;

(since C++17)

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

alignof(T) 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator std::size_t

converts the object to std::size_t, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)

### Member types

Type

Definition

value_type

std::size_t

type

std::integral_constant<std::size_t, value>

### Possible implementation

template<class T>
struct alignment_of : std::integral_constant<std::size_t, alignof(T)> {};

### Notes

This type trait predates the alignof keyword, which can be used to obtain the same value with less verbosity.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>
 
struct A {};
struct B
{
std::int8_t p;
std::int16_t q;
};
 
int main()
{
std::cout << std::alignment_of<A>::value << ' ';
std::cout << std::alignment_of<B>::value << ' ';
std::cout << std::alignment_of<int>() << ' '; // alt syntax
std::cout << std::alignment_of_v<double> << '\n'; // c++17 alt syntax
}

Possible output:

1 2 4 8
