Defined in header <type_traits>

template< class T >

struct is_trivial;

(since C++11) 
(deprecated in C++26)

std::is_trivial is a UnaryTypeTrait.

If T is a trivial type, provides the member constant value equal to true. For any other type, value is false.

If std::remove_all_extents_t<T> is an incomplete type and not (possibly cv-qualified) void, the behavior is undefined.

If the program adds specializations for std::is_trivial or std::is_trivial_v, the behavior is undefined.

### Template parameters

T

-

a type to check

### Helper variable template

template< class T >

constexpr bool is_trivial_v = is_trivial<T>::value;

(since C++17) 
(deprecated in C++26)

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

true if T is a trivial type, false otherwise 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator bool

converts the object to bool, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)

### Member types

std::integral_constant<bool, value>

### Example

Run this code

#include <type_traits>
 
struct A { int m; };
static_assert(std::is_trivial_v<A> == true);
 
struct B { B() {} };
static_assert(std::is_trivial_v<B> == false);
 
// The following class shows why std::is_trivial(_v) may be a pitfall.
class C
{
private:
C() = default;
};
 
static_assert(std::is_trivial_v<C> == true);
static_assert(std::is_trivially_default_constructible_v<C> == false);
 
int main() {}
