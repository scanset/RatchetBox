Defined in header <cfloat>

#define FLT_ROUNDS /* implementation defined */

Specifies the current rounding direction of floating-point arithmetic operations.

Value

Explanation

-1

the default rounding direction is not known

0

toward zero; same meaning as FE_TOWARDZERO

1

to nearest; same meaning as FE_TONEAREST

2

towards positive infinity; same meaning as FE_UPWARD

3

towards negative infinity; same meaning as FE_DOWNWARD

other values

implementation-defined behavior

### Notes

The rounding mode can be changed with std::fesetround and FLT_ROUNDS reflects that change.

The possible values of FLT_ROUNDS match the possible values of std::float_round_style, returned by std::numeric_limits::round_style.
