Defined in header <typeinfo>

class type_info;

The class type_info holds implementation-specific information about a type, including the name of the type and means to compare two types for equality or collating order. This is the class returned by the typeid operator.

The type_info class is neither CopyConstructible nor CopyAssignable.

### Member functions

(constructor)

[deleted]

has neither default nor copy constructors 
(public member function)

(destructor)

[virtual]

the virtual destructor makes type_info a polymorphic class 
(virtual public member function)

operator=

can not be copy-assigned 
(public member function)

operator==operator!=

(removed in C++20)

checks whether the objects refer to the same type 
(public member function)

before

checks whether the referred type precedes referred type of another type_info
object in the implementation defined order, i.e. orders the referred types 
(public member function)

hash_code

(C++11)

returns a value which is identical for the same types 
(public member function)

name
