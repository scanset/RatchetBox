virtual ~type_info();

Destructs an object of type std::type_info. This destructor is public virtual, making the std::type_info a polymorphic class.

### Notes

The dynamic type of a std::type_info subobject may be examined by the typeid operator.

It is unspecified whether the implementation calls this destructor for any std::type_info object at the end of the program.
