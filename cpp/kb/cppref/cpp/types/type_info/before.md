bool before( const type_info& rhs ) const;

(noexcept since C++11)

Returns true if the type of this type_info precedes the type of rhs in the implementation's collation order. No guarantees are given; in particular, the collation order can change between the invocations of the same program.

### Parameters

rhs

-

another type information object to compare to

### Return value

true if the type of this type_info precedes the type of rhs in the implementation's collation order.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <typeinfo>
 
int main()
{
if (typeid(int).before(typeid(char)))
std::cout << "int goes before char in this implementation.\n";
else
std::cout << "char goes before int in this implementation.\n";
}

Possible output:

char goes before int in this implementation.
