Defined in header <system_error>

class error_code;

(since C++11)

std::error_code represents a platform-dependent error code value. Each std::error_code object holds an error code value originating from the operating system or some low-level interface and a pointer to an object of type std::error_category, which corresponds to the said interface. The error code values are not required to be unique across different error categories.
