Defined in header <stdexcept>

class runtime_error;

Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It reports errors that are due to events beyond the scope of the program and cannot be easily predicted. 

Inheritance diagram

Exceptions of type std::runtime_error are thrown by the following standard library components:

- std::locale::locale

- std::locale::combine

- std::chrono::current_zone

- std::chrono::get_tzdb_list

- std::chrono::get_tzdb

- std::chrono::locate_zone

- std::chrono::reload_tzdb

- std::chrono::remote_version

- std::chrono::tzdb::locate_zone

(since C++20)

In addition, the following standard exception types are derived from std::runtime_error:

- std::range_error

- std::overflow_error

- std::underflow_error

- std::ios_base::failure

- std::regex_error

- std::system_error

(since C++11)

- std::filesystem::filesystem_error

(since C++17)

- std::chrono::ambiguous_local_time

- std::chrono::nonexistent_local_time

- std::format_error

(since C++20)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new runtime_error object with the given message 
(public member function)

operator=

replaces the runtime_error object 
(public member function)

## std::runtime_error::runtime_error

runtime_error( const std::string& what_arg );

(1)

runtime_error( const char* what_arg );

(2)

runtime_error( const runtime_error& other );

(3)
(noexcept since C++11)

1) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg.c_str()) == 0.

2) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg) == 0.

3) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::runtime_error then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0. No exception can be thrown from the copy constructor.

### Parameters

what_arg

-

explanatory string

other

-

another exception object to copy

### Exceptions

1,2) May throw std::bad_alloc.

### Notes

Because copying std::runtime_error is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string. This is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&&: it would have to copy the content anyway.

Before the resolution of LWG issue 254, the non-copy constructor can only accept std::string. It makes dynamic allocation mandatory in order to construct a std::string object.

After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy constructor. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.

## std::runtime_error::operator=

runtime_error& operator=( const runtime_error& other );

(noexcept since C++11)

Assigns the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::runtime_error then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment. No exception can be thrown from the copy assignment operator.

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to assign with

### Return value

*this

### Notes

After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy assignment operator. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

(destructor)

[virtual]

destroys the exception object 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)
