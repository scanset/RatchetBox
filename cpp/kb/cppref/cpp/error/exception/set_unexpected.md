std::unexpected_handler set_unexpected( std::unexpected_handler f ) throw();

(until C++11)

std::unexpected_handler set_unexpected( std::unexpected_handler f ) noexcept;

(deprecated in C++11) 
(removed in C++17)

Makes f the new global std::unexpected_handler and returns the previously installed std::unexpected_handler.

This function is thread-safe. Every call to std::set_unexpected synchronizes-with (see std::memory_order) the subsequent calls to std::set_unexpected and std::get_unexpected

(since C++11)

### Parameters

f

-

pointer to function of type std::unexpected_handler, or null pointer

### Return value

The previously-installed unexpected handler, or a null pointer value if none was installed.
