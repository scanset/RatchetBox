bool operator==( const error_category& rhs ) const noexcept;

(1)
(since C++11)

bool operator!=( const error_category& rhs ) const noexcept;

(2)
(since C++11) 
(until C++20)

bool operator<( const error_category& rhs ) const noexcept;

(3)
(since C++11) 
(until C++20)

std::strong_ordering operator<=>( const error_category& rhs ) const noexcept;

(4)
(since C++20)

Compares to another error category.

1) Checks whether *this and rhs refer to the same object.

2) Checks whether *this and rhs do not refer to the same object.

3) Orders *this and rhs by the order of this and &rhs. Equivalent to std::less<const error_category*>()(this, &rhs).

4) Orders *this and rhs by the order of this and &rhs. Equivalent to std::compare_three_way()(this, &rhs).

The <, <=, >, >=, and != operators are synthesized from operator<=> and operator== respectively.

(since C++20)

### Parameters

rhs

-

specifies the error_category to compare

### Return value

1) true if *this and rhs refer to the same object, false otherwise.

2) true if *this and rhs do not refer to the same object, false otherwise.

3) true if *this is less than rhs as defined by the order of this and &rhs.

4) std::strong_order::less if *this is less than rhs as defined by the order of this and &rhs, otherwise std::strong_order::greater if rhs is less than *this in the order, otherwise std::strong_order::equal.
