### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs the system_error object 
(public member function)

operator=

replaces the system_error object 
(public member function)

code

returns error code 
(public member function)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function)

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

(destructor)

[virtual]

destroys the exception object 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <system_error>
#include <thread>
 
int main()
{
try
{
std::thread().detach(); // attempt to detach a non-thread
}
catch(const std::system_error& e)
{
std::cout << "Caught system_error with code "
"[" << e.code() << "] meaning "
"[" << e.what() << "]\n";
}
}

Possible output:

Caught system_error with code [generic:22] meaning [Invalid argument]
