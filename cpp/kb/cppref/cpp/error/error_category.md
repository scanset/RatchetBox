Defined in header <system_error>

class error_category;

(since C++11)

std::error_category serves as the base class for specific error category types, such as std::system_category, std::iostream_category, etc. Each specific category class defines the error_code - error_condition mapping and holds the explanatory strings for all error_conditions. The objects of error category classes are treated as singletons, passed by reference.
