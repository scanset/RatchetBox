(5)
(since C++11) 
(implicitly declared)

Constructs new error code.

1) Constructs error code with default value. Equivalent to error_code(0, std::system_category()).

2) Constructs error code with ec as the platform-dependent error code and ecat as the corresponding error category.

3) Constructs error code from an error code enum e. Equivalent to make_error_code(e), where make_error_code is only found by argument-dependent lookup. This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_error_code_enum<ErrorCodeEnum>::value is true.

4,5) Implicitly defined copy constructor and move constructor. Initializes the error code with the contents of the other.

### Parameters

other

-

another error code to initialize with

ec

-

platform dependent error code to construct with

ecat

-

error category corresponding to ec

e

-

error code enum to construct with
