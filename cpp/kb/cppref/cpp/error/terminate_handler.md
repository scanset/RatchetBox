Defined in header <exception>

typedef void ( *terminate_handler )();

std::terminate_handler is the function pointer type (pointer to function that takes no arguments and returns void), which is installed and queried by the functions std::set_terminate and std::get_terminate and called by std::terminate.

A std::terminate_handler shall terminate execution of the program without returning to the caller, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

The C++ implementation provides a default std::terminate_handler function, which calls std::abort(). If the null pointer value is installed (by means of std::set_terminate), the implementation may restore the default handler instead.
