Defined in header <utility>

template< class T1, class T2 >

struct tuple_size<std::pair<T1, T2>>

: std::integral_constant<std::size_t, 2> { };

(since C++11)

The partial specialization of std::tuple_size for pairs provides a compile-time way to obtain the number of elements in a pair, which is always 2, using tuple-like syntax.

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

the constant value 2 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator std::size_t

converts the object to std::size_t, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)

### Member types

Type

Definition

value_type

std::size_t

type

std::integral_constant<std::size_t, value>

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <tuple>
#include <utility>
 
template<class T>
void test([[maybe_unused]]T t)
{
[[maybe_unused]]
int a[std::tuple_size<T>::value]; // can be used at compile time
std::cout << std::tuple_size<T>::value << '\n'; // or at run time
}
 
int main()
{
test(std::make_tuple(1, 2, 3.14));
test(std::make_pair(1, 3.14));
}

Output:

3
2
