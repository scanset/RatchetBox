Constructs a new pair.

1) Default constructor. Value-initializes both elements of the pair, first and second.

This constructor participates in overload resolution if and only if std::is_default_constructible_v<T1> and std::is_default_constructible_v<T2> are both true.

This constructor is explicit if and only if either T1 or T2 is not implicitly default-constructible.

(since C++11)

2) Initializes first with x and second with y. 

This constructor participates in overload resolution if and only if std::is_copy_constructible_v<T1> and std::is_copy_constructible_v<T2> are both true.

This constructor is explicit if and only if std::is_convertible_v<const T1&, T1> is false or std::is_convertible_v<const T2&, T2> is false.

(since C++11)

3) Initializes first with std::forward<U1>(x) and second with std::forward<U2>(y). 

This constructor participates in overload resolution if and only if std::is_constructible_v<T1, U1> and std::is_constructible_v<T2, U2> are both true.

This constructor is explicit if and only if std::is_convertible_v<U1, T1> is false or std::is_convertible_v<U2, T2> is false.

This constructor is defined as deleted if the initialization of first or second would bind a reference to temporary object.

(since C++23)

4) Initializes first with p.first and second with p.second.

This constructor participates in overload resolution if and only if std::is_constructible_v<T1, U1&> and std::is_constructible_v<T2, U2&> are both true.

This constructor is explicit if and only if std::is_convertible_v<U1&, T1> is false or std::is_convertible_v<U2&, T2> is false.

This constructor is defined as deleted if the initialization of first or second would bind a reference to temporary object.

5) Initializes first with p.first and second with p.second.

This constructor participates in overload resolution if and only if std::is_constructible_v<T1, const U1&> and std::is_constructible_v<T2, const U2&> are both true.

This constructor is explicit if and only if std::is_convertible_v<const U1&, T1> is false or std::is_convertible_v<const U2&, T2> is false.

(since C++11)

This constructor is defined as deleted if the initialization of first or second would bind a reference to temporary object.

(since C++23)

6) Initializes first with std::forward<U1>(p.first) and second with std::forward<U2>(p.second).

This constructor participates in overload resolution if and only if std::is_constructible_v<T1, U1> and std::is_constructible_v<T2, U2> are both true.

This constructor is explicit if and only if std::is_convertible_v<U1, T1> is false or std::is_convertible_v<U2, T2> is false.

This constructor is defined as deleted if the initialization of first or second would bind a reference to temporary object.

(since C++23)

7) Initializes first with std::forward<const U1>(p.first) and second with std::forward<const U2>(p.second).

This constructor participates in overload resolution if and only if std::is_constructible_v<T1, U1> and std::is_constructible_v<T2, U2> are both true.

This constructor is explicit if and only if std::is_convertible_v<const U1, T1> is false or std::is_convertible_v<const U2, T2> is false.

This constructor is defined as deleted if the initialization of first or second would bind a reference to temporary object.

8) Given u1 as std::get<0>(std::forward(u)) and u2 as std::get<1>(std::forward(u)), denote their types as U1 and U2 respectively. Initializes first with u1 and second with u2.

This constructor participates in overload resolution if and only if

- std::remove_cvref(P) is not a specialization of std::ranges::subrange,

- std::is_constructible_v<T1, U1> is true, and

- std::is_constructible_v<T2, U2 is true. 

This constructor is explicit if and only if std::is_convertible_v<U1, T1> is false or std::is_convertible_v<U2, T2> is false.

This constructor is defined as deleted if the initialization of first or second would bind a reference to temporary object.

9) Forwards the elements of first_args to the constructor of first and forwards the elements of second_args to the constructor of second. This is the only non-default constructor that can be used to create a pair of non-copyable non-movable types. The program is ill-formed if first or second is a reference and bound to a temporary object.

10) Copy constructor is implicitly declared(until C++11)defaulted, and is constexpr if copying of both elements satisfies the requirements on constexpr functions(since C++11).

11) Move constructor is defaulted, and is constexpr if moving of both elements satisfies the requirements on constexpr functions.

### Parameters

x

-

value to initialize the first element of this pair

y

-

value to initialize the second element of this pair

p

-

pair of values used to initialize both elements of this pair

u

-

pair-like object of values used to initialize both elements of this pair

first_args

-

tuple of constructor arguments to initialize the first element of this pair

second_args

-

tuple of constructor arguments to initialize the second element of this pair

### Exceptions

Does not throw exceptions unless one of the specified operations (e.g. constructor of an element) throws.

### Example

Run this code

#include <complex>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <tuple>
#include <utility>
 
int main()
{
auto print = [](auto rem, auto const& pair)
{
std::cout << rem << "(" << pair.first << ", " << pair.second << ")\n";
};
 
std::pair<int, float> p1;
print("(1) Value-initialized: ", p1);
 
std::pair<int, double> p2{42, 3.1415};
print("(2) Initialized with two values: ", p2);
 
std::pair<char, int> p4{p2};
print("(4) Implicitly converted: ", p4);
 
std::pair<std::complex<double>, std::string> p6
{std::piecewise_construct, std::forward_as_tuple(0.123, 7.7),
std::forward_as_tuple(10, 'a')};
print("(8) Piecewise constructed: ", p6);
}

Possible output:

(1) Value-initialized: (0, 0)
(2) Initialized with two values: (42, 3.1415)
(4) Implicitly converted: (*, 3)
(8) Piecewise constructed: ((0.123,7.7), aaaaaaaaaa)
