~optional();

(since C++17) 
(constexpr since C++20)

If the object contains a value and the type T is not trivially destructible (see std::is_trivially_destructible), destroys the contained value by calling its destructor, as if by value().T::~T().

Otherwise, does nothing.

### Notes

If T is trivially-destructible, then this destructor is also trivial, so std::optional<T> is also trivially-destructible.
