compare_partial_order_fallback( T&& t, U&& u ) noexcept(/* see below */);

(since C++20)

Performs three-way comparison on subexpressions t and u and produces a result of type std::partial_ordering, even if the operator <=> is unavailable.

If std::decay_t<T> and std::decay_t<U>> are the same type, std::compare_partial_order_fallback(t, u) is expression-equivalent to:

- std::partial_order(t, u), if it is a well-formed expression;

- otherwise, t == u ? std::partial_ordering::equivalent :
t < u  ? std::partial_ordering::less :
u < t  ? std::partial_ordering::greater :
         std::partial_ordering::unordered

if the expressions t == u, t < u and u < t are all well-formed and each of decltype(t == u) and decltype(t < u) models boolean-testable, except that t and u are evaluated only once.

In all other cases, std::compare_partial_order_fallback(t, u) is ill-formed, which can result in substitution failure when it appears in the immediate context of a template instantiation.

### Customization point objects

The name std::compare_partial_order_fallback denotes a customization point object, which is a const function object of a literal semiregular class type. For exposition purposes, the cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted as __compare_partial_order_fallback_fn.

All instances of __compare_partial_order_fallback_fn are equal. The effects of invoking different instances of type __compare_partial_order_fallback_fn on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be invocable). Thus, std::compare_partial_order_fallback can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to std::compare_partial_order_fallback above, __compare_partial_order_fallback_fn models

- std::invocable<__compare_partial_order_fallback_fn, Args...>,

- std::invocable<const __compare_partial_order_fallback_fn, Args...>,

- std::invocable<__compare_partial_order_fallback_fn&, Args...>, and

- std::invocable<const __compare_partial_order_fallback_fn&, Args...>.

Otherwise, no function call operator of __compare_partial_order_fallback_fn participates in overload resolution.
