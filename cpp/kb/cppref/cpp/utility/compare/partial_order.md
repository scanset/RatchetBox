Call signature

template< class T, class U >

    requires /* see below */

constexpr std::partial_ordering

partial_order( T&& t, U&& u ) noexcept(/* see below */);

Compares two values using 3-way comparison and produces a result of type std::partial_ordering.

Let t and u be expressions and T and U denote decltype((t)) and decltype((u)) respectively, std::partial_order(t, u) is expression-equivalent to:

- If std::is_same_v<std::decay_t<T>, std::decay_t<U>> is true:
std::partial_ordering(partial_order(t, u)), if it is a well-formed expression with overload resolution performed in a context that does not include a declaration of std::partial_order,

- otherwise, std::partial_ordering(std::compare_three_way()(t, u)), if it is well-formed,

- otherwise, std::partial_ordering(std::weak_order(t, u)), if it is well-formed.

- In all other cases, the expression is ill-formed, which can result in substitution failure when it appears in the immediate context of a template instantiation.

### Customization point objects

The name std::partial_order denotes a customization point object, which is a const function object of a literal semiregular class type. For exposition purposes, the cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted as __partial_order_fn.

All instances of __partial_order_fn are equal. The effects of invoking different instances of type __partial_order_fn on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be invocable). Thus, std::partial_order can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to std::partial_order above, __partial_order_fn models

- std::invocable<__partial_order_fn, Args...>,

- std::invocable<const __partial_order_fn, Args...>,

- std::invocable<__partial_order_fn&, Args...>, and

- std::invocable<const __partial_order_fn&, Args...>.

Otherwise, no function call operator of __partial_order_fn participates in overload resolution.
