~variant();

(since C++17) 
(constexpr since C++20)

If valueless_by_exception() is true, does nothing. Otherwise, destroys the currently contained object.

This destructor is trivial if std::is_trivially_destructible_v<T_i> is true for all T_i in Types....

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstdio>
#include <variant>
 
int main()
{
struct X { ~X() { puts("X::~X();"); } };
struct Y { ~Y() { puts("Y::~Y();"); } };
 
{
puts("entering block #1");
std::variant<X,Y> var;
puts("leaving block #1");
}
 
{
puts("entering block #2");
std::variant<X,Y> var{ std::in_place_index_t<1>{} }; // constructs var(Y)
puts("leaving block #2");
}
}

Output:

entering block #1
leaving block #1
X::~X();
entering block #2
leaving block #2
Y::~Y();
