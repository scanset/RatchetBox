Defined in header <format>

template< class CharT, std::formattable<CharT>... Ts >

struct formatter</*pair-or-tuple*/<Ts...>, CharT>;

(since C++23)

The template specialization of std::formatter for the std::pair and std::tuple allows users to convert a pair or a tuple to its textual representation as a collection of elements using formatting functions.

The exposition-only name /*pair-or-tuple*/ denotes either class template std::pair or std::tuple.

This specialization meets the Formatter requirements if (std::formattable<const Ts, CharT> && ...) is true. It always meets the BasicFormatter requirements.

### Format specification

The syntax of tuple-format-spec is:

tuple-fill-and-align ﻿(optional) width ﻿(optional) tuple-type ﻿(optional)

The tuple-fill-and-align is interpreted the same way as a fill-and-align except that the fill in tuple-fill-and-align is any character other than {, }, or :. 

The width is described in standard format width specification.

The tuple-type changes the way a tuple is formatted, with certain options only valid with certain argument types. 

The available tuple presentation types are:

- m: Indicates that both opening and closing brackets should be "" while the separator should be ": ".

- If m is chosen as the tuple-type, the program is ill-formed unless sizeof...(Ts) == 2 is true.

- n: Indicates that separator, opening and closing brackets should be "".

### Member objects

Member name

Definition

underlying_ (private)

tuple of underlying formatters of type std::tuple<std::formatter<std::remove_cvref_t<Ts>, CharT>...>
(exposition-only member object*)

separator_ (private)

a string representing the separator of the tuple formatted result (defaults to ", ")
(exposition-only member object*)

opening-bracket_ (private)

a string representing the opening bracket of the tuple formatted result (defaults to "(")
(exposition-only member object*)

closing-bracket_ (private)

a string representing the closing bracket of the tuple formatted result (defaults to ")")
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

set_separator

sets a specified separator for the tuple formatted result 
(public member function)

set_brackets

sets a specified opening and closing brackets for the tuple formatted result 
(public member function)

parse

parses the format specifier as specified by tuple-format-spec 
(public member function)

format

writes the tuple formatted output as specified by tuple-format-spec 
(public member function)

## std::formatter<pair-or-tuple>::set_separator

constexpr void set_separator( std::basic_string_view<CharT> sep ) noexcept;

Assigns sep to separator_.

## std::formatter<pair-or-tuple>::set_brackets

constexpr void set_brackets( std::basic_string_view<CharT> opening,

                             std::basic_string_view<CharT> closing ) noexcept;

Assigns opening and closing to opening-bracket_ and closing-bracket_, respectively.

## std::formatter<pair-or-tuple>::parse

template< class ParseContext >

constexpr auto parse( ParseContext& ctx ) -> ParseContext::iterator;

Parses the format specifiers as a tuple-format-spec and stores the parsed specifiers in the current object.

If tuple-type or the n option is present, the values of opening-bracket, closing-bracket, and separator are modified as required.

For each element e in underlying_, calls e.parse(ctx) to parse an empty format-spec and, if e.set_debug_format() is a valid expression, calls e.set_debug_format().

Returns an iterator past the end of the tuple-format-spec.

## std::formatter<pair-or-tuple>::format

template< class FormatContext >

FormatContext::iterator

format( /*maybe-const-pair-or-tuple*/<Ts...>& elems, FormatContext& ctx ) const;

/*maybe-const-pair-or-tuple*/ denotes:

- const /*pair-or-tuple*/, if (std::formattable<const Ts, CharT> && ...) is true,

- /*pair-or-tuple*/ otherwise.

Writes the following into ctx.out() as specified by tuple-format-spec, in order:

- opening-bracket_,

- for each index I in [​0​, sizeof...(Ts)):

- if I != 0, separator_,

- the result of writing std::get<I>(elems) via std::get<I>(underlying_), and

- closing-bracket_.

Returns an iterator past the end of the output range.
