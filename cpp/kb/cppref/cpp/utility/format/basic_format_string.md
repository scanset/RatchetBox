Defined in header <format>

template< class CharT, class... Args >

struct basic_format_string;

(since C++20)

template< class... Args >

using format_string =

basic_format_string<char, std::type_identity_t<Args>...>;

(since C++20)

Class template std::basic_format_string wraps a std::basic_string_view that will be used by formatting functions.

The constructor of std::basic_format_string performs compile-time format string checks unless the constructor argument is returned by std::runtime_format(since C++26).

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a basic_format_string, raising compile error if the argument is not a format string 
(public member function)

get

returns the wrapped string 
(public member function)

## std::basic_format_string::basic_format_string

template< class T >

consteval basic_format_string( const T& s );

(1)

basic_format_string( /* runtime-format-string */<CharT> s ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++26)

1) Constructs a basic_format_string object that stores a view of string s. If the argument is not a compile-time constant, or if it cannot be parsed as a format string for the formatting argument types Args, the construction is ill-formed.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if const T& models std::convertible_to<std::basic_string_view<CharT>>.

2) Constructs a basic_format_string object that stores a view of string s as returned by std::runtime_format. It does not perform format string checks upon construction.

### Parameters

s

-

an object that represents the format string. The format string consists of

- ordinary characters (except { and }), which are copied unchanged to the output,

- escape sequences {{ and }}, which are replaced with { and } respectively in the output, and

- replacement fields.

Each replacement field has the following format:

{ arg-id (optional) }

(1)

{ arg-id (optional) : format-spec }

(2)

1) replacement field without a format specification

2) replacement field with a format specification

arg-id

-

specifies the index of the argument in args whose value is to be used for formatting; if it is omitted, the arguments are used in order.
The arg-id ﻿s in a format string must all be present or all be omitted. Mixing manual and automatic indexing is an error.

format-spec

-

the format specification defined by the std::formatter specialization for the corresponding argument. Cannot start with }.

- For basic types and standard string types, the format specification is interpreted as standard format specification.

- For chrono types, the format specification is interpreted as chrono format specification.

- For range types, the format specification is interpreted as range format specification.

- For std::pair and std::tuple, the format specification is interpreted as tuple format specification.

- For std::thread::id and std::stacktrace_entry, see thread id format specification and stacktrace entry format specification.

- For std::basic_stacktrace, no format specifier is allowed.

(since C++23)

- For std::filesystem::path, see path format specification.

(since C++26)

- For other formattable types, the format specification is determined by user-defined formatter specializations.

## std::basic_format_string::get

constexpr std::basic_string_view<CharT> get() const noexcept;

Returns the stored string view.

### Notes

The alias templates format_string and wformat_string use std::type_identity_t to inhibit template argument deduction. Typically, when they appear as a function parameter, their template arguments are deduced from other function arguments.

template<class... Args>
std::string format(std::format_string<Args...> fmt, Args&&... args);
 
auto s = format("{} {}", 1.0, 2);
// Calls format<double, int>. Args are deduced from 1.0, 2
// Due to the use of type_identity_t in format_string, template argument deduction
// does not consider the type of the format string.
