move_only_function& operator=( move_only_function&& other );

(1)
(since C++23)

move_only_function& operator=( const move_only_function& ) = delete;

(2)
(since C++23)

move_only_function& operator=( std::nullptr_t ) noexcept;

(3)
(since C++23)

template< class F >

move_only_function& operator=( F&& f );

(4)
(since C++23)

Assigns a new target to std::move_only_function or destroys its target.

1) Moves the target of other to *this or destroys the target of *this (if any) if other is empty, by auto(std::move(other)).swap(*this). other is in a valid state with an unspecified value after move assignment.

2) Copy assignment operator is deleted. std::move_only_function does not satisfy CopyAssignable.

3) Destroys the current target if it exists. *this is empty after the call.

4) Sets the target of *this to the callable f, or destroys the current target if f is a null function pointer, a null pointer to member function, or an empty std::move_only_function, as if by executing move_only_function(std::forward<F>(f)).swap(*this);. This overload participates in overload resolution only if the constructor of move_only_function from F participates in overload resolution. The program is ill-formed or has undefined behavior if the selected constructor call is ill-formed or has undefined behavior.

### Parameters

other

-

another std::move_only_function object to move the target of

f

-

a callable object to initialize the new target with

### Return value

*this

### Notes

It is intentional not to require the move assignment operator to be noexcept to leave room for an allocator-aware move_only_function in future.

move_only_function can be assigned from std::in_place_type<Fn> given it can be constructed from that argument.
