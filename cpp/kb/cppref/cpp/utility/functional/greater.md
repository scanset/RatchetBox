template< class T >

struct greater;

(until C++14)

template< class T = void >

struct greater;

(since C++14)

Function object for performing comparisons. The main template invokes operator> on type T.

### Specializations

greater<void>

(C++14)

function object implementing x > y deducing parameter and return types 
(class template specialization)

### Member types

result_type (deprecated in C++17)(removed in C++20)

bool

first_argument_type (deprecated in C++17)(removed in C++20)

second_argument_type (deprecated in C++17)(removed in C++20)

T

These member types are obtained via publicly inheriting std::binary_function<T, T, bool>.

(until C++11)

### Member functions

operator()

checks whether the first argument is greater than the second 
(public member function)

## std::greater::operator()

bool operator()( const T& lhs, const T& rhs ) const;

(constexpr since C++14)

Checks whether lhs is greater than rhs.

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

values to compare

### Return value

lhs > rhs.

If T is a pointer type, the result is consistent with the implementation-defined strict total order over pointers.

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions. 

### Possible implementation

constexpr bool operator()(const T& lhs, const T& rhs) const 
{
return lhs > rhs; // assumes that the implementation handles pointer total order
}
