struct not_equal_to;

(since C++20)

Function object for performing comparisons. Deduces the parameter types of the function call operator from the arguments (but not the return type).

### Nested types

Nested type

Definition

is_transparent

unspecified

### Member functions

operator()

checks if the arguments are not equal 
(public member function)

## std::ranges::not_equal_to::operator()

template< class T, class U >

constexpr bool operator()( T&& t, U&& u ) const;

Equivalent to return !ranges::equal_to{}(std::forward<T>(t), std::forward<U>(u));.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::equality_comparable_with<T, U> is satisfied.

### Notes

Unlike std::not_equal_to, std::ranges::not_equal_to requires both == and != to be valid (via the equality_comparable_with constraint), and is entirely defined in terms of std::ranges::equal_to.
