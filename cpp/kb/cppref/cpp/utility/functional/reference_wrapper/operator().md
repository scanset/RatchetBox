template< class... ArgTypes >

typename std::result_of<T&(ArgTypes&&...)>::type

operator() ( ArgTypes&&... args ) const;

(since C++11) 
(until C++17)

template< class... ArgTypes >

std::invoke_result_t<T&, ArgTypes...>

operator() ( ArgTypes&&... args ) const noexcept(/* see below */);

(since C++17) 
(constexpr since C++20)

Calls the Callable object, reference to which is stored, as if by INVOKE(get(), std::forward<ArgTypes>(args)...). This function is available only if the stored reference points to a Callable object.

T must be a complete type.

### Parameters

args

-

arguments to pass to the called function

### Return value

The return value of the called function.

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

(since C++11)
(until C++17)

noexcept specification:  
noexcept(std::is_nothrow_invocable_v<T&, ArgTypes...>)

(since C++17)

### Example

Run this code

#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
 
void f1()
{
std::cout << "reference to function called\n";
}
 
void f2(int n)
{
std::cout << "bind expression called with " << n << " as the argument\n";
}
 
int main()
{
std::reference_wrapper<void()> ref1 = std::ref(f1);
ref1();
 
auto b = std::bind(f2, std::placeholders::_1);
auto ref2 = std::ref(b);
ref2(7);
 
auto c = []{ std::cout << "lambda function called\n"; };
auto ref3 = std::ref(c);
ref3();
}

Output:

reference to function called
bind expression called with 7 as the argument
lambda function called
