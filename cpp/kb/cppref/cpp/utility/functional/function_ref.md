Class template std::function_ref is a non-owning function wrapper. std::function_ref objects can store and invoke reference to Callable target - functions, lambda expressions, bind expressions, or other function objects, but not pointers to member functions and pointers to member objects. std::nontype can be used to construct std::function_ref by passing function pointers, pointers to member functions, and pointers to member objects.

std::function_refs supports every possible combination of cv-qualifiers (excluding volatile), and noexcept-specifiers provided in its template parameter.

Every specialization of std::function_ref is a TriviallyCopyable type that satisfies copyable.

### Member types

Member

Definition

BoundEntityType (private)

unspecified TriviallyCopyable type that satisfies copyable and is capable of storing a pointer to object value or pointer to function value
(exposition-only member type*)

FunctionPointerType (private)

R(*)(BoundEntityType ﻿, Args&&...) noexcept(noex ﻿)
where noex is true if noexcept is present in function signature as part of the template parameter of std::function_ref, false otherwise
(exposition-only member type*)

### Data members

Member

Definition

BoundEntityType bound-entity

a bound entity object
(exposition-only member object*)

FunctionPointerType thunk-ptr

a stored pointer to function
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new function_ref object 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns a function_ref 
(public member function)

operator()

invokes the stored thunk of a function_ref 
(public member function)
