function& operator=( const function& other );

(1)
(since C++11)

function& operator=( function&& other );

(2)
(since C++11)

function& operator=( std::nullptr_t ) noexcept;

(3)
(since C++11)

template< class F >

function& operator=( F&& f );

(4)
(since C++11)

template< class F >

function& operator=( std::reference_wrapper<F> f ) noexcept;

(5)
(since C++11)

Assigns a new target to std::function.

1) Assigns a copy of target of other, as if by executing function(other).swap(*this);

2) Moves the target of other to *this. other is in a valid state with an unspecified value.

3) Drops the current target. *this is empty after the call.

4) Sets the target of *this to the callable f, as if by executing function(std::forward<F>(f)).swap(*this);. This operator does not participate in overload resolution unless f is Callable for argument types Args... and return type R.

5) Sets the target of *this to a copy of f, as if by executing function(f).swap(*this);

### Parameters

other

-

another std::function object to copy the target of

f

-

a callable to initialize the target with

Type requirements

-

F must meet the requirements of Callable.

### Return value

*this

### Notes

Even before allocator support was removed from std::function in C++17, these assignment operators use the default allocator rather than the allocator of *this or the allocator of other (see LWG issue 2386).

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <functional>
#include <utility>
 
int inc(int n) { return n + 1; }
 
int main()
{
std::function<int(int)> f1;
std::function<int(int)> f2(inc);
assert(f1 == nullptr and f2 != nullptr);
 
f1 = f2; // overload (1)
assert(f1 != nullptr and f1(1) == 2);
 
f1 = std::move(f2); // overload (2)
assert(f1 != nullptr and f1(1) == 2);
// f2 is in valid but unspecified state
 
f1 = nullptr; // overload (3)
assert(f1 == nullptr);
 
f1 = inc; // overload (4)
assert(f1 != nullptr and f1(1) == 2);
 
f1 = [](int n) { return n + n; }; // overload (4)
assert(f1 != nullptr and f1(2) == 4);
 
std::reference_wrapper<int(int)> ref1 = std::ref(inc);
f1 = ref1; // overload (5)
assert(f1 != nullptr and f1(1) == 2);
}
