Defined in header <cstdlib>

void abort();

(until C++11)

[[noreturn]] void abort() noexcept;

(since C++11)

Causes abnormal program termination unless SIGABRT is being caught by a signal handler passed to std::signal and the handler does not return.

Destructors of variables with automatic, thread local(since C++11) and static storage durations are not called. Functions registered with std::atexit() and std::at_quick_exit(since C++11) are also not called. Whether open resources such as files are closed is implementation defined. An implementation defined status is returned to the host environment that indicates unsuccessful execution. 

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

None because it does not return.

### Exceptions

Throws nothing.

### Notes

POSIX specifies that the abort() function overrides blocking or ignoring the SIGABRT signal.

Some compiler intrinsics, e.g. __builtin_trap (gcc, clang, and icc) or __fastfail/__debugbreak (msvc), can be used to terminate the program as fast as possible.

### Example

Run this code

#include <csignal>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
 
class Tester
{
public:
Tester() { std::cout << "Tester ctor\n"; }
~Tester() { std::cout << "Tester dtor\n"; }
};
 
Tester static_tester; // Destructor not called
 
void signal_handler(int signal) 
{
if (signal == SIGABRT)
std::cerr << "SIGABRT received\n";
else
std::cerr << "Unexpected signal " << signal << " received\n";
std::_Exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
 
int main()
{
Tester automatic_tester; // Destructor not called
 
// Setup handler
auto previous_handler = std::signal(SIGABRT, signal_handler);
if (previous_handler == SIG_ERR)
{
std::cerr << "Setup failed\n";
return EXIT_FAILURE;
}
 
std::abort(); // Raise SIGABRT
std::cout << "This code is unreachable\n";
}

Output:

Tester ctor
Tester ctor
SIGABRT received
