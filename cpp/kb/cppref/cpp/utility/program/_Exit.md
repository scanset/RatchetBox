Defined in header <cstdlib>

[[noreturn]] void _Exit( int exit_code ) noexcept;

(since C++11)

Causes normal program termination to occur without completely cleaning the resources.

Destructors of variables with automatic, thread local and static storage durations are not called. Functions passed to std::at_quick_exit() or std::atexit() are not called. Whether open resources such as files are closed is implementation defined. 

If exit_code is 0 or EXIT_SUCCESS, an implementation-defined status indicating successful termination is returned to the host environment. If exit_code is EXIT_FAILURE, an implementation-defined status, indicating unsuccessful termination, is returned. In other cases implementation-defined status value is returned.

A freestanding implementation is required to provide std::_Exit.

(since C++23)

### Parameters

exit_code

-

exit status of the program

### Return value

(none)

### Notes

Although _Exit is required to be freestanding since C++23, it is not required to be available in a freestanding C implementation.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
 
class Static
{
public:
~Static() 
{
std::cout << "Static dtor\n";
}
};
 
class Local
{
public:
~Local() 
{
std::cout << "Local dtor\n";
}
};
 
Static static_variable; // dtor of this object will *not* be called
 
void atexit_handler()
{
std::cout << "atexit handler\n";
}
 
int main()
{
Local local_variable; // dtor of this object will *not* be called
 
// handler will *not* be called
const int result = std::atexit(atexit_handler);
 
if (result != 0)
{
std::cerr << "atexit registration failed\n";
return EXIT_FAILURE;
}
 
std::cout << "test" << std::endl; // flush from std::endl
// needs to be here, otherwise nothing will be printed
std::_Exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

Output:

test
