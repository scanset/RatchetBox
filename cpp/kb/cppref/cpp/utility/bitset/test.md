bool test( std::size_t pos ) const;

(constexpr since C++23)

Returns the value of the bit at the position pos (counting from 0).

Unlike operator[], it performs a bounds check.

### Parameters

pos

-

position of the bit to return (counting from 0)

### Return value

true if the requested bit is set, false otherwise.

### Exceptions

Throws std::out_of_range if pos does not correspond to a valid bit position.

### Example

Run this code

#include <bit>
#include <bitset>
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
 
int main()
{
std::bitset<10> b1("1111010000");
 
std::size_t idx = 0;
while (idx < b1.size() && !b1.test(idx))
++idx;
 
assert(static_cast<int>(idx) == std::countr_zero(b1.to_ulong()));
 
if (idx < b1.size())
std::cout << "The first set bit is at index " << idx << '\n';
else
std::cout << "no set bits\n";
 
try
{
std::bitset<0B10'1001'1010> bad;
if (bad.test(bad.size()))
std::cout << "Expect unexpected!\n";
}
catch (std::out_of_range const& ex)
{
std::cout << "Exception: " << ex.what() << '\n';
}
}

Possible output:

The first set bit is at index 4
Exception: bitset::test: __position (which is 666) >= _Nb (which is 666)
