bitset& flip();

(1)
(noexcept since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++23)

bitset& flip( std::size_t pos );

(2)
(constexpr since C++23)

Flips bits, i.e. changes true values to false and false values to true. Equivalent to a logical NOT operation on part or all of the bitset.

1) Flips all bits (like operator~, but in-place).

2) Flips the bit at the position pos.

### Parameters

pos

-

the position of the bit to flip

### Return value

*this

### Exceptions

2) Throws std::out_of_range if pos does not correspond to a valid bit position.

### Example

Run this code

#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::bitset<4> flops;
 
std::cout << flops << '\n'
<< flops.flip(0) << '\n'
<< flops.flip(2) << '\n'
<< flops.flip() << '\n';
}

Output:

0000
0001
0101
1010
