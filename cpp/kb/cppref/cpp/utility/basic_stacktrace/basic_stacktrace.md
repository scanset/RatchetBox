basic_stacktrace( const basic_stacktrace& other,

                  const allocator_type& alloc );

(since C++23)

Constructs an empty basic_stacktrace, or copy/move from other.

1) Default constructor. Constructs an empty basic_stacktrace with a default-constructed allocator.

2) Constructs an empty basic_stacktrace using alloc as the allocator.

3) Copy constructor. Constructs a basic_stacktrace with the copy of the contents of other, the allocator is obtained as if by calling std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::select_on_container_copy_construction(other.get_allocator()).

4) Move constructor. Constructs a basic_stacktrace with the contents of other using move semantics. Allocator is move-constructed from that of other. After construction, other is left in a valid but unspecified state.

5) Same as the copy constructor, except that alloc is used as the allocator.

6) Behaves same as the move constructor if alloc == other.get_allocator(). Otherwise, allocates memory with alloc and performs element-wise move. alloc is used as the allocator.

(3,5,6) may throw an exception or construct an empty basic_stacktrace on allocation failure.

### Parameters

alloc

-

allocator to use for all memory allocations of the constructed basic_stacktrace

other

-

another basic_stacktrace to copy/move from

### Exceptions

1) noexcept specification:  
noexcept(std::is_nothrow_default_constructible_v<allocator_type>)

3,5,6) May propagate the exception thrown on allocation failure.

### Complexity

1,2) Constant.

3) Linear in size of other.

4) Constant.

5) Linear in size of other.

6) Linear in size of other if alloc != other.get_allocator(), otherwise constant.

### Notes

After container move construction (overload (4)), references, pointers, and iterators (other than the end iterator) to other remain valid, but refer to elements that are now in *this. The current standard makes this guarantee via the blanket statement in [container.reqmts]/67, and a more direct guarantee is under consideration via LWG issue 2321.
