size_type max_size() const noexcept;

(since C++23)

Returns the maximum number of elements the underlying container (typically a std::vector) is able to hold due to system or library implementation limitations, i.e. std::distance(begin(), end()) for the largest underlying container.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Maximum number of elements.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

This value typically reflects the theoretical limit on the size of the underlying container, at most std::numeric_limits<difference_type>::max(). At runtime, the size of the container may be limited to a value smaller than max_size() by the amount of RAM available.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <stacktrace>
 
int main()
{
std::stacktrace trace;
std::cout << "Maximum size of a 'basic_stacktrace' is " << trace.max_size() << "\n";
}

Possible output:

Maximum size of a 'basic_stacktrace' is 1152921504606846975
