> struct pair;

std::pair is a class template that provides a way to store two heterogeneous objects as a single unit. A pair is a specific case of a std::tuple with two elements.

If neither T1 nor T2 is a possibly cv-qualified class type with non-trivial destructor, or array thereof, the destructor of pair is trivial.

### Template parameters

T1, T2

-

the types of the elements that the pair stores.

### Member types

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs new pair 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns the contents 
(public member function)

swap

(C++11)

swaps the contents 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

make_pair

creates a pair object of type, determined by the argument types 
(function template)

operator==operator!=operator<operator<=operator>operator>=operator<=>

(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(C++20)

lexicographically compares the values in the pair 
(function template)

std::swap(std::pair)

(C++11)

specializes the std::swap algorithm 
(function template)

get(std::pair)

(C++11)

accesses an element of a pair 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::tuple_size<std::pair>

(C++11)

obtains the size of a pair 
(class template specialization)

std::tuple_element<std::pair>

(C++11)

obtains the type of the elements of pair 
(class template specialization)

std::basic_common_reference<std::pair>

(C++23)

determines the common reference type of two pairs 
(class template specialization)

std::common_type<std::pair>

(C++23)

determines the common type of two pairs 
(class template specialization)

std::formatter<std::pair>

(C++23)

formatting support for pair 
(class template specialization)

### Helper specializations

template< class T, class U >

constexpr bool enable_nonlocking_formatter_optimization<std::pair<T, U>> 

 = enable_nonlocking_formatter_optimization<T> &&

enable_nonlocking_formatter_optimization<U>;

(since C++23)

This specialization of std::enable_nonlocking_formatter_optimization enables efficient implementation of std::print and std::println for printing a pair object when both T and U enable it.
