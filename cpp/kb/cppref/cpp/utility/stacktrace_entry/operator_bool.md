constexpr explicit operator bool() const noexcept;

(since C++23)

Checks whether the stacktrace_entry is non-empty, i.e. it represents an evaluation in a stacktrace.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if the stacktrace_entry is non-empty, false otherwise.

### Notes

A non-empty stacktrace_entry can be obtained from a std::basic_stacktrace created by std::basic_stacktrace::current or a copy of such std::basic_stacktrace.

An empty stacktrace_entry can be created by the default constructor.
