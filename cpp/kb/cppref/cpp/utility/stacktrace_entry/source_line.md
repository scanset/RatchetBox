std::uint_least32_t source_line() const;

(since C++23)

Returns a 1-based line number that lexically relates to the evaluation represented by *this, or 0 on failure other than allocation failure, e.g. when *this is empty.

Either source_file returns the presumed source file name and source_line returns the presumed line number, or source_file returns the actual source file name and source_line returns the actual line number.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The line number specified above on success, 0 on failure other than allocation failure.

### Exceptions

Throws std::bad_alloc if memory for the internal data structures cannot be allocated.

### Notes

The presumed line number is what the predefined macro __LINE__ expands to, and can be changed by the 
#line directive.

Reason: definition of "actual line number" is missing (LWG issue 3507)

This function is not required to be noexcept because getting source line requires allocation on some platforms.
