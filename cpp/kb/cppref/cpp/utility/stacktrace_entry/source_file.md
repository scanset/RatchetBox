std::string source_file() const;

(since C++23)

Returns the presumed or actual name of the source file that lexically contains the expression or statement whose evaluation is represented by *this, or an empty string on failure other than allocation failure, e.g. when *this is empty.

Either source_file returns the presumed source file name and source_line returns the presumed line number, or source_file returns the actual source file name and source_line returns the actual line number.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The name of the source file specified above on success, an empty string on failure other than allocation failure.

### Exceptions

Throws std::bad_alloc if memory for the internal data structures or the resulting string cannot be allocated.

### Notes

The presumed name of the source file is what the predefined macro __FILE__ expands to, and can be changed by the 
#line directive.

Custom allocators support for this function is not provided, because the implementations usually require platform specific allocations, system calls and a lot of CPU intensive work, while a custom allocator does not provide benefits for this function as the platform specific operations take an order of magnitude more time than the allocation.
