constexpr std::uint_least32_t line() const noexcept;

(since C++20)

Returns the line number represented by this object.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The line number represented by this object.

An implementation is encouraged to return 0 when the line number is unknown.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
#include <source_location>
 
inline void cur_line(
const std::string_view message = "",
const std::source_location& location = std::source_location::current())
{
std::cout
<< location.line() // <- the line # of a call site
<< ") "
<< message; 
}
 
int main()
{
cur_line("++\n");
cur_line(); std::cout << "Hello,\n";
cur_line(); std::cout << "C++20!\n";
cur_line("--\n");
}

Output:
