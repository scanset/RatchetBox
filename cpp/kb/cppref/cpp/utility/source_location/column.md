constexpr std::uint_least32_t column() const noexcept;

(since C++20)

Returns an implementation-defined value representing some offset from the start of the line represented by this object (i.e., the column number). Column numbers are presumed to be 1-indexed. 

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

An implementation-defined value representing some offset from the start of the line represented by this object (i.e., the column number).

An implementation is encouraged to use 0 when the column number is unknown.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <source_location>
 
template<typename T = std::source_location>
inline void pos(const T& location = T::current())
{
std::cout
<< "("
<< location.line()
<< ':' 
<< location.column()
<< ") ";
}
 
int main()
{
// ↓: column #9
pos(); std::cout << "Proxima\n"; // row #18
pos(); std::cout << "Centauri\n"; // row #19
// ↑: column #11
}

Possible output:

(18:9) Proxima
(19:11) Centauri
