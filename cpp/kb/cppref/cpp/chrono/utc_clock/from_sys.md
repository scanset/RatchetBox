static std::chrono::utc_time<std::common_type_t<Duration, std::chrono::seconds>>

from_sys( const std::chrono::sys_time<Duration>& t );

(since C++20)

Converts a sys_time t to a utc_time u that represents the same point in time.

u.time_since_epoch() - t.time_since_epoch() is equal to the number of leap seconds that was inserted between t and 1 January 1970. If t is the exact date of a leap second insertion, that leap second is counted as inserted.

### Return value
