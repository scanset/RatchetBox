template< class Duration >

static std::chrono::sys_time<std::common_type_t<Duration, std::chrono::seconds>>

to_sys( const std::chrono::utc_time<Duration>& t );

(since C++20)

Converts a utc_time t to a sys_time representing the same point in time (if possible).

If t represents a time point during a leap second insertion, the last representable value of sys_time prior to the insertion of the leap second is returned. In all other cases, utc_clock::from_sys(utc_clock::to_sys(t)) == t.

### Return value

A sys_time representing the same point in time as t, or the last representable value prior to the insertion of the leap second if t represents a time point during a leap second insertion.
