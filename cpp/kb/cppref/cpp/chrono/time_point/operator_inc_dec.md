constexpr time_point& operator++();

(1)
(since C++20)

constexpr time_point operator++( int );

(2)
(since C++20)

constexpr time_point& operator--();

(3)
(since C++20)

constexpr time_point operator--( int );

(4)
(since C++20)

Modifies the point in time *this represents by one tick of the duration.

If d_ is a member variable holding the duration (i.e., time since epoch) of this time_point object, 

1) Equivalent to ++d_; return *this;.

2) Equivalent to return time_point(d_++).

3) Equivalent to --d_; return *this;.

4) Equivalent to return time_point(d_--);.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

1,3) A reference to this time_point after modification.

2,4) A copy of the time_point made before modification.
