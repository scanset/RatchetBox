time_point& operator-=( const duration& d );

(2)
(since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++17)

Modifies the time point by the given duration.

1) Applies the offset d to pt. Effectively, d is added to the internally stored duration d_ as d_ += d.

2) Applies the offset d to pt in negative direction. Effectively, d is subtracted from internally stored duration d_ as d_ -= d.

### Parameters

d

-

a time offset to apply

### Return value

*this

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
