constexpr

year_month_weekday_last( const std::chrono::year& y, const std::chrono::month& m,

const std::chrono::weekday_last& wdl ) noexcept;

(since C++20)

Constructs a year_month_weekday_last object storing the year y, the month m, and the weekday wdl.weekday(). The constructed object represents the last weekday of that year and month.

### Notes

A year_month_weekday_last can also be created by combining one of the partial-date types std::chrono::year_month and std::chrono::month_weekday_last with the missing component (weekday_last and year, respectively) using operator/.
