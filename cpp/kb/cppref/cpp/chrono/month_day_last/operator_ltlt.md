std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&

    operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os,

const std::chrono::month_day_last& mdl );

(since C++20)

Outputs a textual representation of mdl into os, as if by

os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}/last"), mdl.month());

where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}/last") is "{:L}/last" if CharT is char, and L"{:L}/last" if CharT is wchar_t.
