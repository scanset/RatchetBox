std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&

    operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os,

const std::chrono::weekday_indexed& wdi );

(since C++20)

Outputs a textual representation of wdi into the stream os, as if by:

if (wdi.index() >=1 && wdi.index() <= 5)

    os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}[{}]"),

                      wdi.weekday(), wdi.index());

else

    os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}[{} is not a valid index]"),

                      wdi.weekday(), wdi.index());

where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("...") is "..." if CharT is char, and L"..." if CharT is wchar_t.
