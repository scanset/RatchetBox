Defined in header <chrono>

class nonexistent_local_time;

(since C++20)

Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception to report that an attempt was made to convert a nonexistent std::chrono::local_time to a std::chrono::sys_time without specifying a std::chrono::choose (such as choose::earliest or choose::latest).

This exception is thrown by std::chrono::time_zone::to_sys and functions that call it (such as the constructors of std::chrono::zoned_time that take a std::chrono::local_time).

### Member functions

(constructor)

(public member function)

operator=

replaces the exception object 
(public member function)

what

returns the explanatory string 
(public member function)

## std::chrono::nonexistent_local_time::nonexistent_local_time

template< class Duration >

nonexistent_local_time( const std::chrono::local_time<Duration>& tp,

const std::chrono::local_info& i );

(1)
(since C++20)

nonexistent_local_time( const nonexistent_local_time& other ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++20)

Constructs the exception object.

1) The explanatory string returned by what() is equivalent to that produced by os.str() after the following code:

std::ostringstream os;
os << tp << " is in a gap between\n"
<< std::chrono::local_seconds(i.first.end.time_since_epoch()) + i.first.offset
<< ' ' << i.first.abbrev << " and\n"
<< std::chrono::local_seconds(i.second.begin.time_since_epoch()) + i.second.offset
<< ' ' << i.second.abbrev
<< " which are both equivalent to\n"
<< i.first.end << " UTC";

The behavior is undefined if i.result != std::chrono::local_info::nonexistent.

2) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::chrono::nonexistent_local_time then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0.

### Parameters

tp

-

the time point for which conversion was attempted

i

-

a std::chrono::local_info describing the result of the conversion attempt

other

-

another nonexistent_local_time to copy

### Exceptions

May throw std::bad_alloc

### Notes

Because copying a standard library class derived from std::exception is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string.

## std::chrono::nonexistent_locale_time::operator=

nonexistent_locale_time& operator=( const nonexistent_locale_time& other ) noexcept;

(since C++20)

Assigns the contents with those of other.If *this and other both have dynamic type std::chrono::nonexistent_locale_time then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment.

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to assign with

### Return value

*this

## std::chrono::nonexistent_locale_time::what

virtual const char* what() const noexcept;

(since C++20)

Returns the explanatory string.

### Return value

Pointer to an implementation-defined null-terminated string with explanatory information. The string is suitable for conversion and display as a std::wstring. The pointer is guaranteed to be valid at least until the exception object from which it is obtained is destroyed, or until a non-const member function (e.g. copy assignment operator) on the exception object is called.

The returned string is encoded with the ordinary literal encoding during constant evaluation.

(since C++26)

### Notes

Implementations are allowed but not required to override what().

## Inherited from std::runtime_error

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

(destructor)

[virtual]

destroys the exception object 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)
