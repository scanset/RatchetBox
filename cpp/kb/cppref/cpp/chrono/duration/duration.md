constexpr duration() = default;

(since C++11)

duration( const duration& ) = default;

(2)
(since C++11)

template< class Rep2 >

constexpr explicit duration( const Rep2& r );

(3)

template< class Rep2, class Period2 >

constexpr duration( const duration<Rep2, Period2>& d );

(4)
(since C++11)

Constructs a new duration from one of several optional data sources.

1) The default constructor.

2) The copy constructor.

3) Constructs a duration with r ticks.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

- is_convertible<const Rep2&, Rep>::value is true.

- Any of the following conditions is satisfied:[1]

- std::chrono::treat_as_floating_point<Rep>::value is true.

- std::chrono::treat_as_floating_point<Rep2>::value is false.

4) Constructs a duration by converting d to an appropriate period and tick count, as if by std::chrono::duration_cast<duration>(d).count().

This overload participates in overload resolution only if no overflow is induced in the conversion, and any of the following conditions is satisfied:[2]

- std::chrono::treat_as_floating_point<Rep>::value is true.

- All following conditions are satisfied:

- std::ratio_divide<Period2, Period>::den is 1.

- std::chrono::treat_as_floating_point<Rep2>::value is false.

- ↑ That is, a duration with an integer tick count cannot be constructed from a floating-point value, but a duration with a floating-point tick count can be constructed from an integer value.

- ↑ That is, either the duration uses floating-point ticks, or Period2 is exactly divisible by Period.

### Parameters

r

-

a tick count

d

-

a duration to copy from

### Example

The following code shows several examples (both valid and invalid) of how to construct durations:

Run this code

#include <chrono>
 
int main()
{
std::chrono::hours h(1); // one hour
std::chrono::milliseconds ms{3}; // 3 milliseconds
std::chrono::duration<int, std::kilo> ks(3); // 3000 seconds
 
// error: treat_as_floating_point<int>::value == false,
// This duration allows whole tick counts only
// std::chrono::duration<int, std::kilo> d3(3.5);
 
// 30Hz clock using fractional ticks
std::chrono::duration<double, std::ratio<1, 30>> hz30(3.5);
 
// 3000 microseconds constructed from 3 milliseconds
std::chrono::microseconds us = ms;
// error: 1/1000000 is not divisible by 1/1000
// std::chrono::milliseconds ms2 = us
std::chrono::duration<double, std::milli> ms2 = us; // 3.0 milliseconds
}
