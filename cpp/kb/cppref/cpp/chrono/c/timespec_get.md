Defined in header <ctime>

int timespec_get( std::timespec* ts, int base );

(1)
(since C++17)

#define TIME_UTC /* implementation-defined */

(2)
(since C++17)

1) Modifies the std::timespec object pointed to by ts to hold the current calendar time in the time base base.

2) Expands to a value suitable for use as the base argument of std::timespec_get.

Other macro constants beginning with TIME_ may be provided by the implementation to indicate additional time bases.

If base is TIME_UTC, then

- ts->tv_sec is set to the number of seconds since an implementation defined epoch, truncated to a whole value,

- ts->tv_nsec member is set to the integral number of nanoseconds, rounded to the resolution of the system clock.

### Parameters

ts

-

pointer to an object of type std::timespec

base

-

TIME_UTC or another nonzero integer value indicating the time base

### Return value

The value of base if successful, zero otherwise.

### Notes

The POSIX function clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, ts) may also be used to populate a std::timespec with the time since the Epoch.

### Example

Run this code

#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::timespec ts;
std::timespec_get(&ts, TIME_UTC);
char buf[100];
std::strftime(buf, sizeof buf, "%D %T", std::gmtime(&ts.tv_sec));
std::cout << "Current time: " << buf << '.' << ts.tv_nsec << " UTC\n";
}

Possible output:

Current time: 06/24/16 20:07:42.949494132 UTC
