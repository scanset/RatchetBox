Defined in header <ctime>

struct tm;

Structure holding a calendar date and time broken down into its components.

### Member objects

int tm_sec

seconds after the minute – [​0​, 61](until C++11) [​0​, 60](since C++11)[note 1] 
(public member object)

int tm_min

minutes after the hour – [​0​, 59] 
(public member object)

int tm_hour

hours since midnight – [​0​, 23] 
(public member object)

int tm_mday

day of the month – [1, 31] 
(public member object)

int tm_mon

months since January – [​0​, 11] 
(public member object)

int tm_year

years since 1900 
(public member object)

int tm_wday

days since Sunday – [​0​, 6] 
(public member object)

int tm_yday

days since January 1 – [​0​, 365] 
(public member object)

int tm_isdst

Daylight Saving Time flag. The value is positive if DST is in effect, zero if not and negative if no information is available. 
(public member object)

- ↑ Range allows for a positive leap second. Two leap seconds in the same minute are not allowed (the range [​0​, 61] was a defect introduced in C89 and corrected in C99).

### Notes

BSD, GNU and musl C library support two additional members, which are standardized in POSIX.1-2024.

long tm_gmtoff

seconds east of UTC 
(public member object)

const char* tm_zone

timezone abbreviation 
(public member object)

### Example

Run this code

#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::tm tm{};
tm.tm_year = 2022 - 1900;
tm.tm_mday = 1;
std::mktime(&tm);
 
std::cout << std::asctime(&tm); // note implicit trailing '\n'
}

Possible output:
