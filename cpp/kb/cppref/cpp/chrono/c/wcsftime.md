std::size_t wcsftime( wchar_t* str, std::size_t count, const wchar_t* format, const std::tm* time );

Converts the date and time information from a given calendar time time to a null-terminated wide character string str according to format string format. Up to count wide characters are written.

### Parameters

str

-

pointer to the first element of the wchar_t array for output

count

-

maximum number of wide characters to write

format

-

pointer to a null-terminated wide character string specifying the format of conversion

time

-

pointer to the date and time information to be converted

### Format string

The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers and ordinary characters (except %). All ordinary characters, including the terminating null character, are copied to the output string without modification. Each conversion specification begins with % character, optionally followed by E or O modifier (ignored if unsupported by the locale), followed by the character that determines the behavior of the specifier. The following format specifiers are available:

### Return value

Number of wide characters written into the wide character array pointed to by str not including the terminating L'\0' on success. If count was reached before the entire string could be stored, ​0​ is returned and the contents are undefined.

### Example

Run this code

#include <ctime>
#include <cwchar>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
std::locale::global(std::locale("ja_JP.utf8"));
std::time_t t = std::time(nullptr);
wchar_t wstr[100];
if (std::wcsftime(wstr, 100, L"%A %c", std::localtime(&t)))
std::wcout << wstr << '\n';
}

Possible output:

火曜日 2011年12月27日 17時43分13秒
