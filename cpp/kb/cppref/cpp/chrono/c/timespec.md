Defined in header <ctime>

struct timespec;

(since C++17)

Structure holding an interval broken down into seconds and nanoseconds.

### Data members

Member

Description

std::time_t tv_sec

whole seconds, the value is >= ​0​ 
(public member object)

long tv_nsec

nanoseconds, the value is in range [​0​, 999999999] 
(public member object)

The declaration order of tv_sec and tv_nsec is unspecified. Implementation may add other data members to timespec.

### Notes

The type of tv_nsec is long long on some platforms, which is currently non-conforming in C++, but is allowed in C since C23.

### Example

Run this code

#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::timespec ts;
std::timespec_get(&ts, TIME_UTC);
char buff[0x80];
std::strftime(buff, sizeof buff, "%D %T", std::gmtime(&ts.tv_sec));
 
// auto [sec, nsec] = ts; // UB: structured bindings should not be used because the
// declaration order and data member list are unspecified
 
std::cout << "Current time: " << buff << " (UTC)\n"
<< "Raw timespec.tv_sec: " << ts.tv_sec << '\n'
<< "Raw timespec.tv_nsec: " << ts.tv_nsec << '\n';
}

Possible output:

Current time: 04/06/23 12:03:31 (UTC)
Raw timespec.tv_sec: 1680782611
Raw timespec.tv_nsec: 678437213
