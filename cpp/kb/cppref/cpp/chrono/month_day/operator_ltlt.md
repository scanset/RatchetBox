template< class CharT, class Traits >

std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&

operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os, const std::chrono::month_day& md );

(since C++20)

Outputs a textual representation of md into the stream os, as if by

os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}/{}"), md.month(), md.day())

where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}/{}") is "{:L}/{}" if CharT is char, and L"{:L}/{}" if CharT is wchar_t.
