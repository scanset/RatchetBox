class time_zone_link;

(since C++20)

The class time_zone_link represents an alternative name for a time zone.

Users cannot construct time_zone_link objects. The library implementation creates time_zone_link objects when it initializes the time zone database and provides const access to these objects.

time_zone_link is not copyable but does have a defaulted move constructor and a defaulted move assignment operator. However, as users have only const access to time_zone_link objects, these functions cannot be called in user code without invoking undefined behavior.
