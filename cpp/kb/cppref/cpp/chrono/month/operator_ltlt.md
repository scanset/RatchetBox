Defined in header <chrono>

template< class CharT, class Traits >

std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&

operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os, const std::chrono::month& m );

(since C++20)

If !m.ok(), inserts unsigned(m) followed by " is not a valid month" to os. Otherwise, forms a std::basic_string<CharT> s consisting of the abbreviated month name for the month represented by m, determined using the locale associated with os, and inserts s into os.

Equivalent to

return os << (m.ok() ?

    std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L%b}"), m) :

    std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{} is not a valid month"), unsigned(m)));

where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("...") is "..." if CharT is char, and L"..." if CharT is wchar_t.

### Return value

os

### Notes

This operator<< is primarily intended for debugging use. For control over formatting, use std::format.
