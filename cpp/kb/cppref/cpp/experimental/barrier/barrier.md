(1)
(concurrency TS)

barrier( const barrier & ) = delete;

(2)
(concurrency TS)

1) Constructs a barrier for num_threads participating threads. The set of participating threads is the first num_threads threads to arrive at the synchronization point.

2) Copy constructor is deleted; barrier is not copyable.

### Parameters

num_threads

-

the number of participating threads for the barrier; must be non-negative

### Notes 

If num_threads is zero, the set of participating threads is empty, and barrier can only be destroyed.
