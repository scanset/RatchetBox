class any;

(library fundamentals TS)

The class any describes a type-safe container for single values of any type.

1) An object of class any stores an instance of any type that satisfies the constructor requirements or is empty, and this is referred to as the state of the class any object. The stored instance is called the contained object. Two states are equivalent if they are either both empty or if both are not empty and if the contained objects are equivalent.

2) The non-member any_cast functions provide type-safe access to the contained object.

Implementations are encouraged to avoid dynamic allocations for small objects, but such an optimization may only be applied to types that for which std::is_nothrow_move_constructible returns true.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs an any object 
(public member function)

operator=

(public member function)

(destructor)

destroys an any object 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

clear

destroys contained object 
(public member function)

swap

swaps two any objects 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

empty

checks if object holds a value 
(public member function)

type

returns the typeid of the contained value 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

swap

swaps two any instances 
(function)

any_cast

type-safe access to the contained object 
(function template)
