(library fundamentals TS)

std::experimental::weak_ptr is a modified version of std::weak_ptr that interoperates with std::experimental::shared_ptr and has support for arrays.

### Member types

Member type

Definition

element_type

std::remove_extent_t<T>

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs new weak_ptr 
(public member function)

## Members and non-members identical to std::weak_ptr 

### Member functions

The following member functions work with std::experimental::shared_ptr instead of std::shared_ptr and std::experimental::weak_ptr instead of std::weak_ptr. The behavior is otherwise identical.

(destructor)

destroys a weak_ptr 
(public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>)

operator=

assigns the weak_ptr 
(public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>)

#### Modifiers 

reset

releases the ownership of the managed object 
(public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>)

swap

swaps the managed objects 
(public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>)

#### Observers 

use_count

returns the number of shared_ptr objects that manage the object 
(public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>)

expired

checks whether the referenced object was already deleted 
(public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>)

lock

creates a shared_ptr that manages the referenced object 
(public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>)

owner_before

provides owner-based ordering of weak pointers 
(public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>)

### Non-member functions

This non-member function is declared in the std::experimental namespace, and work with std::experimental::weak_ptr rather than std::weak_ptr, but otherwise behaves identically to the corresponding C++14 function.

std::swap(std::weak_ptr)

(C++11)

specializes the std::swap algorithm 
(function template)
