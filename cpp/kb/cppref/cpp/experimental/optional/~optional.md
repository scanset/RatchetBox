~optional();

(library fundamentals TS)

If the object contains a value and the type T is not trivially destructible (see std::is_trivially_destructible), destroys the contained value by calling its destructor, as if by val->T::~T().

Otherwise, does nothing.

### Notes

If T is trivially-destructible, then this destructor is also trivial, so optional<T> is also trivially-destructible.
