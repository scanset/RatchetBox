Version 3 of the C++ Extensions for Library Fundamentals, ISO/IEC TS 19568:2024, defines the following new components for the C++ standard library, in addition to those defined in version 1 and version 2.

Components merged into C++17/20 and the following components are removed in LFTS v3:

- std::experimental::make_array,

- std::experimental::erased_type,

- std::experimental::packaged_task, and

- std::experimental::promise.

### Scope guard

Defined in header <experimental/scope> 

scope_exit

wraps a function object and invokes it on exiting the scope 
(class template)

scope_fail

wraps a function object and invokes it on exiting the scope through an exception 
(class template)

scope_success

wraps a function object and invokes it on exiting the scope normally 
(class template)

unique_resource

universal RAII resource handle wrapper 
(class template)

### Feature test macros

Defined in header <experimental/memory_resource> 

__cpp_lib_experimental_memory_resources

a value of at least 201803 indicates that resource_adaptor is supported 
(macro constant)

Defined in header <experimental/functional> 

__cpp_lib_experimental_function_polymorphic_allocator

a value of at least 202211 indicates that std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<> is used for std::experimental::function 
(macro constant)

Defined in header <experimental/scope> 

__cpp_lib_experimental_scope

a value of at least 201902 indicates that the scope guards are supported 
(macro constant)

### Notes

The value of __cpp_lib_experimental_memory_resources has been increased in LFTS v3, because the design of resource_adaptor is rebased onto std::pmr::memory_resource.
