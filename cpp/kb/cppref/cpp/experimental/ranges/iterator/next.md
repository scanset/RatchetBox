(customization point object)

Call signature

template< Iterator I >

constexpr I next( I i );

(1)

template< Iterator I >

constexpr I next( I i, ranges::difference_type_t<I> n );

(2)

template< Iterator I, Sentinel<I> S >

constexpr I next( I i, S bound );

(3)

template< Iterator I, Sentinel<I> S >

constexpr I next( I i, ranges::difference_type_t<I> n, S bound );

(4)

Advances the iterator i n times, or until bound is reached, whichever comes first, and returns the advanced iterator.

1) Equivalent to ++i; return i;.

2) Equivalent to ranges::advance(i, n); return i;.

3) Equivalent to ranges::advance(i, bound); return i;.

4) Equivalent to ranges::advance(i, n, bound); return i;.

### Customization point objects 

The name ranges::next denotes a customization point object, which is a function object of a literal Semiregular class type (denoted, for exposition purposes, as NextT). All instances of NextT are equal. Thus, ranges::next can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to ranges::next above, NextT will satisfy ranges::Invocable<const NextT, Args...>. Otherwise, no function call operator of NextT participates in overload resolution.

In every translation unit in which ranges::next is defined, it refers to the same instance of the customization point object. (This means that it can be used freely in things like inline functions and function templates without violating the one-definition rule.)

### Return value

The advanced iterator.

### Notes

Even though omitting n for overload (2) behaves as if n is 1, omitting n for overload (4) effectively behaves as if n is infinity (always advance to bound).
