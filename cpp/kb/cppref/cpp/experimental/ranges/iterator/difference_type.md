(5)

Computes the associated difference type of the type I, if any. Users may specialize difference_type for a program-defined type.

1) Primary template is an empty struct.

2) Specialization for pointers. If T is an object type, provides a member type type equal to std::ptrdiff_t. Otherwise, there is no member type.

3) Specialization for const-qualified types.

4) Specialization for types that define a public and accessible member type difference_type. Provides a member type type equal to T::difference_type. 

5) Specialization for types that do not define a public and accessible member type difference_type but do support subtraction. Provides a member type type equal to std::make_signed_t<decltype(std::declval<T>() - std::declval<T>())>.

### Helper alias template

template< class T > 

using difference_type_t = typename ranges::difference_type<T>::type;
