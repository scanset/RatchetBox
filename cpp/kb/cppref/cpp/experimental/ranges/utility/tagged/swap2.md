friend constexpr void swap( tagged& lhs, tagged& rhs ) noexcept(noexcept(lhs.swap(rhs)))

    requires Swappable<Base>;

Swap the contents of *this and rhs, as if by lhs.swap(rhs);.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when tagged is an associated class of the arguments.

### Notes

Unlike most non-member swaps in the standard library, this swap is a hidden friend function declared in the body of tagged, not a function template. The tagged in the function declaration is the injected-class-name.
