Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>

template< class T >

concept bool UnsignedIntegral = Integral<T> && !SignedIntegral<T>;

(ranges TS)

The concept UnsignedIntegral<T> is satisfied if and only if T is an integral type and std::is_signed<T>::value is false.

### Notes

UnsignedIntegral<T> may be satisfied by a type that is not a unsigned integer type, for example, bool.
