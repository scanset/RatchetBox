static constexpr source_location current() noexcept;

(library fundamentals TS v2)

Constructs a new source_location object. 

### Return value 

If current() is invoked directly (via a function call that names current()), it returns a source_location object with implementation-defined values representing the location of the call. The values should be affected by the #line preprocessor directive in the same manner as the predefined macros __LINE__ and __FILE__.

If current() is invoked in any other manner, the return value is unspecified.

### Remarks 

If current() is used in an initializer for a non-static data member, the return value corresponds to the location of the constructor or aggregate initialization that initializes the data member.

### Notes 

When current() is used in a default argument, the return value will correspond to the location of the call to current() at the call site.

### Parameters

(none)
