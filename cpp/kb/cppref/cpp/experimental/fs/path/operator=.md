1) Replaces the contents of *this with a copy of the contents of p.

2) Replaces the contents of *this with p, possibly using move semantics: p is left in valid, but unspecified state.

3) Replaces the contents of *this with a new path value constructed from source as if by overload (4) of the path constructor. Equivalent to assign(source).

### Parameters

p

-

a path to assign

source

-

a std::basic_string, pointer to a null-terminated character/wide character string, or an input iterator that points to a null-terminated character/wide character sequence. The character type must be one of char, char16_t, char32_t, wchar_t

### Return value

*this

### Exceptions

1) (none)

2) noexcept specification:  noexcept

3) (none)

### Example

Run this code

#include <experimental/filesystem>
namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
fs::path p = "C:/users/abcdef/AppData/Local";
p = p / "Temp"; // move assignment
const wchar_t* wstr = L"D:/猫.txt";
p = wstr; // assignment from a source
}
