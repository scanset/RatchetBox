(8)
(filesystem TS)

Concatenates the current path and the argument.

1) Concatenates *this and p in such a way that native() of the result is exactly original native() concatenated with p.native().

2) Same as (1), except the resulting native() is a concatenation of the original native() and the string str.

3) Same as (1), except the resulting native() is a concatenation of the original native() and the null-terminated string whose first character is pointed to by ptr.

4) Same as (1), except the resulting native() is a concatenation of the original native() and the single character x.

5) Same as (1), except the resulting native() is a concatenation of the original native() and the sequence (which may be in portable or native format) represented by source, which may be std::basic_string, null-terminated multicharacter string, or an input iterator pointing to a null-terminated multicharacter sequence.

6) Same as (4), except that character conversion may be performed.

7) Same as (5).

8) Same as (5), except that the sequence is represented by any iterator pair that designates a multicharacter string.

### Parameters

p

-

path to append

str

-

string to append

ptr

-

pointer to the beginning of a null-terminated string to append

x

-

single character to append

source

-

std::basic_string, null-terminated multicharacter string, or an input iterator pointing to a null-terminated multicharacter sequence, which represents a path name (either in portable or in native format)

first, last

-

pair of LegacyInputIterators that specify a multicharacter sequence that represents a path name

Type requirements

-

InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

-

The value type of InputIt must be one of the encoded character types (char, wchar_t, char16_t and char32_t).

-

CharT must be one of the encoded character types (char, wchar_t, char16_t and char32_t).

### Return value

*this

### Exceptions

May throw filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors or std::bad_alloc if memory allocation fails.

### Notes

Unlike with append() or operator/=, additional directory separators are never introduced.

### Example

Run this code

#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <iostream>
namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
fs::path p1; // empty path
p1 += "var"; // does not insert a separator
std::cout << "\"\" + \"var\" == " << p1 << '\n';
p1 += "lib"; // does not insert a separator
std::cout << "\"\" + \"var\" + \"lib\" == " << p1 << '\n';
}

Output:

"" + "var" == "var"
"" + "var" + "lib" == "varlib"
