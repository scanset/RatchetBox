path parent_path() const;

(filesystem TS)

Returns the path to the parent directory. Returns empty path if empty() or there's only a single element in the path (begin() == --end()).

The resulting path is constructed by appending all elements in a range [begin(), --end()) to an empty path.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The path to the parent directory.

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions. 

### Example

Run this code

#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <iostream>
namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
for (fs::path p : {"/var/tmp/example.txt", "/", "/var/tmp/."})
std::cout << "The parent path of " << p
<< " is " << p.parent_path() << '\n';
}

Possible output:

The parent path of "/var/tmp/example.txt" is "/var/tmp"
The parent path of "/" is ""
The parent path of "/var/tmp/." is "/var/tmp"
