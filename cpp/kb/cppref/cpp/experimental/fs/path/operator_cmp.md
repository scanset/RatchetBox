(filesystem TS)

bool operator!=( const path& lhs, const path& rhs );

(2)
(filesystem TS)

bool operator<( const path& lhs, const path& rhs );

(3)
(filesystem TS)

(5)

(6)
(filesystem TS)

Compares two paths lexicographically.

1) Checks whether lhs and rhs are equal. Equivalent to !(lhs < rhs) && !(rhs < lhs).

2) Checks whether lhs and rhs are not equal. Equivalent to !(lhs == rhs).

3) Checks whether lhs is less than rhs. Equivalent to lhs.compare(rhs) < 0.

4) Checks whether lhs is less than or equal to rhs. Equivalent to !(rhs < lhs).

5) Checks whether lhs is greater than rhs. Equivalent to rhs < lhs.

6) Checks whether lhs is greater than or equal to rhs. Equivalent to !(lhs < rhs).

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

the paths to compare

### Return value

true if the corresponding comparison yields, false otherwise.

### Exceptions

noexcept specification:  noexcept

### Notes

Path equality and equivalence have different semantics.

In the case of equality, as determined by operator==, only lexical representations are compared. Therefore, path("a") == path("b") is never true.

In the case of equivalence, as determined by equivalent(), it is checked whether two paths resolve to the same file system object. Thus equivalent("a", "b") will return true if the paths resolve to the same file.
