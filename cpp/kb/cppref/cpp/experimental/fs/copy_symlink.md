void copy_symlink( const path& from, const path& to,

                   error_code& ec );

(2)
(filesystem TS)

Copies a symlink to another location.

1) Effectively calls f(read_symlink(from), to) where f is create_symlink() or create_directory_symlink depending on whether from resolves to a file or directory.

2) Effectively calls f(read_symlink(from, ec), to, ec) where f is create_symlink() or create_directory_symlink depending on whether from resolves to a file or directory.

### Parameters

from

-

path to a symbolic link to copy

to

-

destination path of the new symlink

ec

-

out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

The overload that does not take an error_code& parameter throws filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with from as the first argument, to as the second argument, and the OS error code as the error code argument. std::bad_alloc may be thrown if memory allocation fails. The overload taking an error_code& parameter sets it to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur. This overload has noexcept specification:  noexcept
