Defined in header <experimental/filesystem>

bool remove( const path& p );

bool remove( const path& p, error_code& ec );

(1)
(filesystem TS)

std::uintmax_t remove_all( const path& p );

std::uintmax_t remove_all( const path& p, error_code& ec );

(2)
(filesystem TS)

1) The file or empty directory identified by the path p is deleted as if by the POSIX remove. Symlinks are not followed (symlink is removed, not its target).

2) Deletes the contents of p (if it is a directory) and the contents of all its subdirectories, recursively, then deletes p itself as if by repeatedly applying the POSIX remove. Symlinks are not followed (symlink is removed, not its target).

### Parameters

p

-

path to delete

ec

-

out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload

### Return value

1) true if the file was deleted, false if it did not exist. The overload that takes error_code& argument returns false on errors.

2) Returns the number of files and directories that were deleted (which may be zero if p did not exist to begin with). The overload that takes error_code& argument returns static_cast<std::uintmax_t>(-1) on error.

### Exceptions

The overload that does not take an error_code& parameter throws filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with p as the first argument and the OS error code as the error code argument. std::bad_alloc may be thrown if memory allocation fails. The overload taking an error_code& parameter sets it to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur. This overload has noexcept specification:  noexcept

### Notes

On POSIX systems, this function typically calls unlink and rmdir as needed, on Windows RemoveDirectoryW and DeleteFileW.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstdint>
#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <iostream>
namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
fs::path dir = fs::temp_directory_path();
fs::create_directories(dir / "abcdef/example");
std::uintmax_t n = fs::remove_all(dir / "abcdef");
std::cout << "Deleted " << n << " files or directories\n";
}

Possible output:

Deleted 2 files or directories
