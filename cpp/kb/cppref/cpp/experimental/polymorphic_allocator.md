class polymorphic_allocator;

(library fundamentals TS)

The class template std::experimental::pmr::polymorphic_allocator is an Allocator whose allocation behavior depends on the memory resource it is constructed with. Thus, different instances of polymorphic_allocator can exhibit entirely different allocation behavior. This runtime polymorphism allows objects using polymorphic_allocator to behave as if they used different allocator types at run time despite the identical static allocator type.
