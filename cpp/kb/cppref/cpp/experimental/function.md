std::experimental::function is a modified version of std::function with support for type-erased allocators.

### Member types

Type

Definition

allocator_type

std::experimental::erased_type

(library fundamentals TS)
(until library fundamentals TS v3)

std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<>

(library fundamentals TS v3)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new std::experimental::function instance 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns a new target 
(public member function)

swap

swaps the contents 
(public member function)

get_memory_resource

(removed in library fundamentals TS v3)

retrieves a pointer to the memory resource used by this object to allocate memory 
(public member function)

get_allocator

(library fundamentals TS v3)

retrieves a type-erased std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator used by this object to allocate memory 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

std::experimental::swap(std::experimental::function)

specializes the swap algorithm 
(function template)

operator==operator!=

(removed in library fundamentals TS v3)

compares an std::experimental::function with nullptr 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::uses_allocator<std::experimental::function>

(removed in library fundamentals TS v3)

specializes the std::uses_allocator type trait 
(class template specialization)

### Member types

R

#### Member types removed in Library Fundamental TS v3 

argument_type

T if sizeof...(Args) == 1 and T is the first and only type in Args...

first_argument_type

T1 if sizeof...(Args) == 2 and T1 is the first of the two types in Args...

second_argument_type

T2 if sizeof...(Args) == 2 and T2 is the second of the two types in Args...

Member types argument_type, first_argument_type, and second_argument_type are removed, because the correponding member types of std::function are removed in C++20.

(library fundamentals TS v3)

### Member functions

(destructor)

destroys a std::function instance 
(public member function of std::function<R(Args...)>)

operator bool

checks if a target is contained 
(public member function of std::function<R(Args...)>)

operator()

invokes the target 
(public member function of std::function<R(Args...)>)

#### Target access 

target_type

obtains the typeid of the stored target 
(public member function of std::function<R(Args...)>)

target

obtains a pointer to the stored target 
(public member function of std::function<R(Args...)>)
