Constructs a new std::experimental::packaged_task object.

1) Constructs a std::experimental::packaged_task object with no task and no shared state.

2) Constructs a std::experimental::packaged_task object with a shared state and a copy of the task, initialized with std::forward<F>(f). This constructor does not participate in overload resolution if std::decay<F>::type is the same type as std::packaged_task<R(ArgTypes...)>. 

3) Constructs a std::experimental::packaged_task object with a shared state and a copy of the task, initialized with std::forward<F>(f). Uses the provided allocator to allocate memory necessary to store the task, which is treated as a type-erased allocator (see below). This constructor does not participate in overload resolution if std::decay<F>::type is the same type as std::packaged_task<R(ArgTypes...)>. 

4) The copy constructor is deleted, std::experimental::packaged_task is move-only. 

5) Constructs a std::experimental::packaged_task with the shared state and task formerly owned by rhs, leaving rhs with no shared state and a moved-from task.

### Type-erased allocator 

The constructors of packaged_task taking an allocator argument alloc treats that argument as a type-erased allocator. The memory resource pointer used by packaged_task to allocate memory is determined using the allocator argument (if specified) as follows:

Type of alloc

Value of the memory resource pointer

Non-existent (no allocator specified at time of construction)

The value of std::experimental::pmr::get_default_resource() at time of construction.

std::nullptr_t

The value of std::experimental::pmr::get_default_resource() at time of construction.

A pointer type convertible to
std::experimental::pmr::memory_resource*

static_cast<std::experimental::pmr::memory_resource*>(alloc)

A specialization of
std::experimental::pmr::polymorphic_allocator

alloc.resource()

Any other type meeting the Allocator requirements

A pointer to a value of type std::experimental::pmr::resource_adaptor<A>(alloc), where A is the type of alloc. The pointer remains valid only for the lifetime of the packaged_task object.

None of the above

The program is ill-formed.

### Parameters

f

-

the callable target (function, member function, lambda-expression, functor) to execute

alloc

-

the allocator to use when storing the task

rhs

-

the std::experimental::packaged_task to move from

### Exceptions

2,3) Any exceptions thrown by copy/move constructor of f and possiblly std::bad_alloc if the allocation fails.

4) (none)
