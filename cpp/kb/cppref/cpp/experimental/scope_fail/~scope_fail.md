~scope_fail() noexcept;

(library fundamentals TS v3)

Calls the exit function if the result of std::uncaught_exceptions() is greater than the counter of uncaught exceptions (typically on stack unwinding) and the scope_fail is active, then destroys the stored EF (if it is a function object) and any other non-static data members.

### Notes

Whether the destructor is called on stack unwinding can be detected by the comparison of the result of std::uncaught_exceptions() and the counter of uncaught exceptions in the scope_fail.
