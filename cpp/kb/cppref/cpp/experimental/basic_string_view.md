(library fundamentals TS)

The class template basic_string_view describes an object that can refer to a constant contiguous sequence of char-like objects with the first element of the sequence at position zero. 

A typical implementation holds only two members: a pointer to constant CharT and a size.

Several typedefs for common character types are provided:

### Template parameters

CharT

-

character type

Traits

-

traits class specifying the operations on the character type

### Member types

Note: iterator and const_iterator are the same type because string views are views into constant character sequences.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a basic_string_view 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns a view 
(public member function)

#### Iterators 

begincbegin

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

endcend

returns an iterator to the end 
(public member function)

rbegincrbegin

returns a reverse iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

rendcrend

returns a reverse iterator to the end 
(public member function)

#### Element access 

operator[]

access specified character 
(public member function)

at

access specified character with bounds checking 
(public member function)

front

accesses the first character 
(public member function)

back

accesses the last character 
(public member function)

data

returns a pointer to the first character of a view 
(public member function)

#### Capacity 

sizelength

returns the number of characters 
(public member function)

max_size

returns the maximum number of characters 
(public member function)

empty

checks whether the view is empty 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

remove_prefix

shrinks the view by moving its start forward 
(public member function)

remove_suffix

shrinks the view by moving its end backward 
(public member function)

swap

swaps the contents 
(public member function)

#### Operations 

to_stringoperator basic_string

creates a string from the view 
(public member function)

copy

copies characters 
(public member function)

substr

returns a substring 
(public member function)

compare

compares two views 
(public member function)

find

find characters in the view 
(public member function)

rfind

find the last occurrence of a substring 
(public member function)

find_first_of

find first occurrence of characters 
(public member function)

find_last_of

find last occurrence of characters 
(public member function)

find_first_not_of

find first absence of characters 
(public member function)

find_last_not_of

find last absence of characters 
(public member function)

### Constants

npos

[static]

special value. The exact meaning depends on the context 
(public static member constant)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator!=operator<operator>operator<=operator>=

lexicographically compares two views 
(function template)

#### Input/output 

operator<<

performs stream output on views 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::hash<std::experimental::string_view>std::hash<std::experimental::wstring_view>std::hash<std::experimental::u16string_view>std::hash<std::experimental::u32string_view>

hash support for views 
(class template specialization)

### Feature test macros

__cpp_lib_experimental_string_view

a value of at least 201411 indicates that basic_string_view template is supported 
(macro constant)
