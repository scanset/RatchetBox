explicit flex_barrier( std::ptrdiff_t num_threads );

(1)
(concurrency TS)

template< class F >

flex_barrier( std::ptrdiff_t num_threads, F completion );

(2)
(concurrency TS)

flex_barrier( const flex_barrier & ) = delete;

(3)
(concurrency TS)

1) Has the same effect as flex_barrier(num_threads, c), where c is a Callable object whose invocation returns -1 and has no side effects.

2) Constructs a flex_barrier for num_threads participating threads, using completion for the completion phase. The set of participating threads is the first num_threads threads to arrive at the synchronization point.

3) Copy constructor is deleted; flex_barrier is not copyable.

### Parameters

num_threads

-

the number of participating threads for the flex_barrier; must be non-negative

completion

-

a function object controlling the completion phase; must be Callable with no arguments and return type std::ptrdiff_t, and when invoked, must return a value no less than -1 and must not throw an exception

Type requirements

-

F must meet the requirements of CopyConstructible.

### Notes 

If num_threads is zero, the set of participating threads is empty, and flex_barrier can only be destroyed.
