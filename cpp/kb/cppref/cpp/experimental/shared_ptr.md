template< class T > class shared_ptr;

(library fundamentals TS)

std::experimental::shared_ptr is a modified version of std::shared_ptr that adds support for arrays.

### Member types

Member type

Definition

element_type

std::remove_extent_t<T>

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs new shared_ptr 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

get

returns the stored pointer 
(public member function)

operator*operator->

dereferences the stored pointer 
(public member function)

operator[]

provides index access to the array 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

static_pointer_castdynamic_pointer_castconst_pointer_castreinterpret_pointer_cast

applies static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, or reinterpret_cast to the stored pointer 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::hash<std::experimental::shared_ptr>

hash support for std::experimental::shared_ptr 
(class template specialization)

## Members and non-members identical to std::shared_ptr 

### Member functions

The following member functions work with std::experimental::shared_ptr instead of std::shared_ptr and std::experimental::weak_ptr instead of std::weak_ptr. The behavior is otherwise identical.

(destructor)

destructs the owned object if no more shared_ptrs link to it 
(public member function of std::shared_ptr<T>)

operator=

assigns the shared_ptr 
(public member function of std::shared_ptr<T>)

#### Modifiers 

reset

replaces the managed object 
(public member function of std::shared_ptr<T>)

swap

swaps the managed objects 
(public member function of std::shared_ptr<T>)

#### Observers 

use_count

returns the number of shared_ptr objects referring to the same managed object 
(public member function of std::shared_ptr<T>)

unique

(until C++20)

checks whether the managed object is managed only by the current shared_ptr object 
(public member function of std::shared_ptr<T>)

operator bool

checks if the stored pointer is not null 
(public member function of std::shared_ptr<T>)

owner_before

provides owner-based ordering of shared pointers 
(public member function of std::shared_ptr<T>)

### Non-member functions

These non-member functions are declared in the std::experimental namespace, and work with std::experimental::shared_ptr rather than std::shared_ptr, but otherwise behaves identically to the corresponding C++14 function.

make_sharedmake_shared_for_overwrite

(C++20)

creates a shared pointer that manages a new object 
(function template)

allocate_sharedallocate_shared_for_overwrite

(C++20)

creates a shared pointer that manages a new object allocated using an allocator 
(function template)

get_deleter

returns the deleter of specified type, if owned 
(function template)

operator==operator!=operator<operator<=operator>operator>=operator<=>

(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(C++20)

compares with another shared_ptr or with nullptr 
(function template)

operator<<(std::shared_ptr)

outputs the value of the stored pointer to an output stream 
(function template)

std::swap(std::shared_ptr)

(C++11)

specializes the std::swap algorithm 
(function template)

std::atomic_is_lock_free(std::shared_ptr)std::atomic_load(std::shared_ptr)std::atomic_load_explicit(std::shared_ptr)std::atomic_store(std::shared_ptr)std::atomic_store_explicit(std::shared_ptr)std::atomic_exchange(std::shared_ptr)std::atomic_exchange_explicit(std::shared_ptr)std::atomic_compare_exchange_weak(std::shared_ptr)std::atomic_compare_exchange_strong(std::shared_ptr)std::atomic_compare_exchange_weak_explicit(std::shared_ptr)std::atomic_compare_exchange_strong_explicit(std::shared_ptr)

(deprecated in C++20)(removed in C++26)

specializes atomic operations for std::shared_ptr 
(function template)

### Helper class templates 

These class templates are declared in the std::experimental namespace, and work with std::experimental::shared_ptr and std::experimental::weak_ptr rather than std::shared_ptr and std::weak_ptr, but otherwise behaves identically to the corresponding C++14 class template.

owner_less

(C++11)

provides mixed-type owner-based ordering of shared and weak pointers 
(class template)

enable_shared_from_this

(C++11)

allows an object to create a shared_ptr referring to itself 
(class template)
