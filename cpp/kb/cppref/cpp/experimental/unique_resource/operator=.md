unique_resource& operator=( unique_resource&& other )

    noexcept(/*see below*/);

(library fundamentals TS v3)

Move assignment operator. Replaces the managed resource and the deleter with other's.

Formally, let RS be the type of stored resource handle:

- First, calls reset() to dispose the currently owned resource, if any.

- Then assigns the stored resource handle and the deleter with other's. std::move is applied to the stored resource handle or the deleter of other if std::is_nothrow_move_assignable_v<RS> or std::is_nothrow_move_assignable_v<D> is true respectively. Assignment of the stored resource handle is executed first, unless std::is_nothrow_move_assignable_v<D> is false and std::is_nothrow_move_assignable_v<RS> is true.

- Finally, sets *this to own the resource if and only if other owned it before assignment, and other not to own the resource.

If std::is_nothrow_move_assignable_v<RS> is true, RS shall satisfy the MoveAssignable requirements; otherwise RS shall satisfy the CopyAssignable requirements. If std::is_nothrow_move_assignable_v<D> is true, D shall satisfy the MoveAssignable requirements; otherwise D shall satisfy the CopyAssignable requirements. Failing to satisfy above requirements results in undefined behavior.

### Parameters

other

-

resource wrapper from which ownership will be transferred

### Return value

*this

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown in copy-assignment.

noexcept specification:  
noexcept(std::is_nothrow_move_assignable_v<RS> && std::is_nothrow_move_assignable_v<D>)

### Notes

If a copy of a member throws an exception, this mechanism leaves other intact and *this in the released state.
