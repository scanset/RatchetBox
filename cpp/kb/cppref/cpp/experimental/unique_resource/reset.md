void reset() noexcept;

template< class RR >

void reset( RR&& r );

(2)
(library fundamentals TS v3)

1) Disposes the resource by calling the deleter with the underlying resource handle if the unique_resource owns it. The unique_resource does not own the resource after the call.

2) Replaces the resource by calling (1) and then assigns the stored resource handle with std::forward<RR>(r) if std::is_nothrow_assignable_v<RS, RR> is true, otherwise std::as_const(r), where RS is the type of stored resource handle. The unique_resource owns the resource after the call.

If copy-assignment of the store resource handle throws an exception, calls del_(r), where del is the deleter object.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if the selected assignment expression assigning the stored resource handle is well-formed.

The program is ill-formed if del_(r) is ill-formed.

The behavior is undefined if del_(r) results in undefined behavior or throws an exception.

### Parameters

r

-

resource handle for a new resource to manage

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

2) Any exception thrown in assigning the stored resource handle.

### Notes

The mechanism ensures no leaking of resources.
