Defined in header <experimental/simd>

template< class T, class U = typename T::value_type >

struct memory_alignment;

(parallelism TS v2)

If is_simd_mask_v<T> is true and U is bool, or if is_simd_v<T> is true and U is a vectorizable type, provides the member constant value equal to the minimum alignment of a pointer passed to a load constructor, copy_from function, or copy_to function. For any other types T and U, there is no member value. 

If the program adds specializations for std::memory_alignment or std::memory_alignment_v(since C++17), the behavior is undefined.

### Helper variable template

template< class T, class U = typename T::value_type >

constexpr std::size_t memory_alignment_v = memory_alignment<T, U>::value;

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

the minimum alignment of a pointer passed to a load constructor, copy_from function, or copy_to function 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator std::size_t

converts the object to std::size_t, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)

### Member types
