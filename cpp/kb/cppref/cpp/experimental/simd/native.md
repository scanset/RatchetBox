(parallelism TS v2)

native<T> is an implementation-defined alias for an ABI tag. This is the primary ABI tag to use for efficient explicit vectorization.

### Notes

The intent is to use the ABI tag producing the most efficient data-parallel execution for the element type T that is supported on the currently targeted system. For target architectures without ISA extensions, the native<T> and compatible<T> aliases will likely be the same. For target architectures with ISA extensions, compiler flags may influence the native<T> alias while compatible<T> will be the same independent of such flags.
