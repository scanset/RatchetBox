struct vector_aligned_tag {};

inline constexpr vector_aligned_tag vector_aligned{};

(parallelism TS v2)

This tag type indicates that the buffer of copy_from and copy_to is aligned to memory_alignment_v<T, U>, where the copy operation operates on the simd/simd_mask type T, and the buffer with element type U.

### Notes

This tag type allows to implement vector-aligned load and store.
