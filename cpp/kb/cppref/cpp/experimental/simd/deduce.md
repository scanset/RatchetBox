Defined in header <experimental/simd>

template< class T, std::size_t N, class ...Abis >

struct deduce;

(parallelism TS v2)

The type deduce<T, N, Abis...>::type is present if and only if:

- T is a vectorizable type,

- simd_abi::fixed_size<N> is supported, and

- every type in Abis... is an ABI tag.

Let DA denote deduce<T, N, Abis...>::type when it presents, then

- simd_size_v<T, DA> == N,

- simd<T, DA> is default constructible, i.e. it is supported,

- DA is simd_abi::scalar if N == 1, otherwise it is implementation-defined.

type

an ABI tag type suitable for specified element type T and size N

### Helper types

template< class T, std::size_t N, class ...Abis >

using deduce_t = typename deduce<T, N, Abis...>::type;

(parallelism TS v2)

### Notes

simd_abi::deduce is SFINAE-friendly.

The ABI tag deduced via this facility is a Quality-of-Implementation feature. 
Implementations can base the choice on Abis..., but can also ignore the Abis... arguments. A simple implementation might simply return fixed_size<N> unconditionally. An optimized implementation might return an implementation-defined extended ABI tag for most inputs. Consequently, if you need an ABI tag for a certain number of elements, use fixed_size if ABI stability is of concern, and prefer deduce_t otherwise.
