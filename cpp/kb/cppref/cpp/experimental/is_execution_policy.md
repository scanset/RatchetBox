Defined in header <experimental/execution_policy>

template< class T >

struct is_execution_policy;

(parallelism TS)

Checks whether T is a standard or implementation-defined execution policy type.

Provides the member constant value which is equal to true, if T is execution_policy, sequential_execution_policy, parallel_execution_policy, parallel_vector_execution_policy, or an implementation-defined execution policy type. Otherwise, value is equal to false.

The behavior of a program that adds specializations for is_execution_policy is undefined.

### Template parameters

### Member constants

value

[static]

true if T is a standard or implementation-defined execution policy type, false otherwise 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator bool

converts the object to bool, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)
