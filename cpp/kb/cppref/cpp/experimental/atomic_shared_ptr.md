class atomic_shared_ptr;

(concurrency TS)

The class template atomic_shared_ptr provides thread-safe atomic pointer operations over a std::shared_ptr. It provides a better alternative to the non-member shared_ptr atomic access functions.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs an atomic_shared_ptr object 
(public member function)

operator=

stores a value into an atomic_shared_ptr object 
(public member function)

is_lock_free

checks if the atomic_shared_ptr object is lock-free 
(public member function)

store

atomically replaces the value of the atomic object with a non-atomic argument 
(public member function)

load

atomically obtains the value of the atomic object 
(public member function)

operator shared_ptr<T>

loads a value from an atomic object 
(public member function)

exchange

atomically replaces the value of the atomic object and obtains the value held previously 
(public member function)

compare_exchange_weakcompare_exchange_strong

atomically compares the value of the atomic object with non-atomic argument and performs atomic exchange if equal or atomic load if not 
(public member function)
