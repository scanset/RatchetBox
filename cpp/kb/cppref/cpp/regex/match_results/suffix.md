const_reference suffix() const;

(since C++11)

Obtains a reference to the std::sub_match object representing the target sequence between the end of the entire match of the regular expression and the end of the target sequence.

ready() must be true. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <regex>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::regex re("a(a)*by");
std::string target("baaaby123");
std::smatch sm;
 
std::regex_search(target, sm, re);
std::cout << sm.suffix() << '\n';
}

Output:
