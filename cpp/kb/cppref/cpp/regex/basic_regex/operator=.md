2) Move assignment operator. Assigns the contents of other using move semantics. other is in valid, but unspecified state after the operation. Equivalent to assign(other);.

3) Assigns a null-terminated character string pointed to by ptr. Equivalent to assign(ptr);.

4) Assigns characters contained in initializer list il. Equivalent to assign(il);.

5) Assigns the contents of the string p. Equivalent to assign(p);.

### Parameters
