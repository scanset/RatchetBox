Defined in header <regex>

template< class CharT >

class regex_traits;

(since C++11)

The type trait template regex_traits supplies std::basic_regex with the set of types and functions necessary to operate on the type CharT.

Since many of regex operations are locale-sensitive (when std::regex_constants::collate flag is set), the regex_traits class typically holds an instance of a std::locale as a private member.

### Standard specializations

Two specializations of std::regex_traits are defined by the standard library:

std::regex_traits<char>

std::regex_traits<wchar_t>

These specializations make it possible to use std::basic_regex<char> (aka std::regex) and std::basic_regex<wchar_t> (aka std::wregex). To use std::basic_regex with other character types (for example, char32_t), a user-provided trait class must be used.

### Member types

Type

Definition

char_type

CharT

string_type

std::basic_string<CharT>

locale_type

The locale used for localized behavior in the regular expression. Must be CopyConstructible

char_class_type

Represents a character classification and is capable of holding an implementation specific set returned by lookup_classname. Must be a BitmaskType.

### Member functions
