int compare( const string_type& s ) const;

int compare( const value_type* c ) const;

1) Compares two sub_matches directly by comparing their underlying character sequences. Equivalent to str().compare(m.str()).

2) Compares a sub_match with a std::basic_string. Equivalent to str().compare(s).

3) Compares a sub_match with a null-terminated sequence of the underlying character type pointed to by s. Equivalent to str().compare(c).

### Parameters

m

-

a reference to another sub_match

s

-

a reference to a string to compare to

c

-

a pointer to a null-terminated character sequence of the underlying value_type to compare to

### Return value

A value less than zero if this sub_match is less than the other character sequence, zero if the both underlying character sequences are equal, greater than zero if this sub_match is greater than the other character sequence.

### Notes

This function is infrequently used directly by application code. Instead, one of the non-member comparison operators is used.
