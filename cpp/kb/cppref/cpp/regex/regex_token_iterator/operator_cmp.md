Checks whether *this and other are equivalent.

Two regex token iterators are equal if:

a) They are both end-of-sequence iterators.

b) They are both suffix iterators and the suffixes are equal.

c) Neither of them is end-of-sequence or suffix iterator and:

- position == other.position

- N == other.N

- subs == other.subs

1) Checks whether *this is equal to other.

2) Checks whether *this is not equal to other.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

Reason: Explain better. For example, subs is an exposition-only vector of matched sub-expressions.

### Parameters

other

-

another regex token iterator to compare to

### Return value

1) true if *this is equal to other, false otherwise.

2) true if *this is not equal to other, false otherwise.
