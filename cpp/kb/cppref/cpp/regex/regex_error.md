Defines the type of exception object thrown to report errors in the regular expressions library.

Inheritance diagram

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a regex_error object 
(public member function)

operator=

replaces the regex_error object 
(public member function)

code

gets the std::regex_constants::error_type for a regex_error 
(public member function)

## Inherited from std::runtime_error

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

(destructor)

[virtual]

destroys the exception object 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <regex>
 
int main()
{
try
{
std::regex re("[a-b][a");
}
catch (const std::regex_error& e)
{
std::cout << "regex_error caught: " << e.what() << '\n';
if (e.code() == std::regex_constants::error_brack)
std::cout << "The code was error_brack\n";
}
}

Possible output:

regex_error caught: The expression contained mismatched [ and ].
The code was error_brack
