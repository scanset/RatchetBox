Accesses the imaginary part of the complex number. 

1) Returns the imaginary part.

2) Sets the imaginary part to value.

### Parameters

value

-

the value to set the imaginary part to

### Return value

1) The imaginary part of *this.

2) (none)

### Notes

In C++11, overload (1) in std::complex specializations used to be specified without const qualifier. However, in C++11, a constexpr specifier used in a non-static member function implies const, and thus the behavior is as if const is specified.
