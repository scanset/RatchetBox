template< class T > 

complex<T> cosh( const complex<T>& z );

(since C++11)

Computes complex hyperbolic cosine of a complex value z. 

### Parameters

z

-

complex value

### Return value

If no errors occur, complex hyperbolic cosine of z is returned.

### Error handling and special values

Errors are reported consistent with math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic,

- std::cosh(std::conj(z)) == std::conj(std::cosh(z))

- std::cosh(z) == std::cosh(-z)

- If z is (+0,+0), the result is (1,+0)

- If z is (+0,+∞), the result is (NaN,±0) (the sign of the imaginary part is unspecified) and FE_INVALID is raised

- If z is (+0,NaN), the result is (NaN,±0) (the sign of the imaginary part is unspecified)

- If z is (x,+∞) (for any finite non-zero x), the result is (NaN,NaN) and FE_INVALID is raised

- If z is (x,NaN) (for any finite non-zero x), the result is (NaN,NaN) and FE_INVALID may be raised

- If z is (+∞,+0), the result is (+∞,+0)

- If z is (+∞,y) (for any finite non-zero y), the result is +∞cis(y)

- If z is (+∞,+∞), the result is (±∞,NaN) (the sign of the real part is unspecified) and FE_INVALID is raised

- If z is (+∞,NaN), the result is (+∞,NaN)

- If z is (NaN,+0), the result is (NaN,±0) (the sign of the imaginary part is unspecified)

- If z is (NaN,+y) (for any finite non-zero y), the result is (NaN,NaN) and FE_INVALID may be raised

- If z is (NaN,NaN), the result is (NaN,NaN)

where cis(y) is cos(y) + i sin(y).

### Notes

Mathematical definition of hyperbolic cosine is cosh z = ez
+e-z

.
Hyperbolic cosine is an entire function in the complex plane and has no branch cuts. It is periodic with respect to the imaginary component, with period 2πi.

### Examples

Run this code

#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{ 
std::cout << std::fixed;
std::complex<double> z(1.0, 0.0); // behaves like real cosh along the real line
std::cout << "cosh" << z << " = " << std::cosh(z)
<< " (cosh(1) = " << std::cosh(1) << ")\n";
 
std::complex<double> z2(0.0, 1.0); // behaves like real cosine along the imaginary line
std::cout << "cosh" << z2 << " = " << std::cosh(z2)
<< " ( cos(1) = " << std::cos(1) << ")\n";
}

Output:

cosh(1.000000,0.000000) = (1.543081,0.000000) (cosh(1) = 1.543081)
cosh(0.000000,1.000000) = (0.540302,0.000000) ( cos(1) = 0.540302)
