Accesses the real part of the complex number. 

1) Returns the real part.

2) Sets the real part to value.

### Parameters

value

-

the value to set the real part to

### Return value

1) The real part of *this.

2) (none)

### Notes

In C++11, overload (1) in std::complex specializations used to be specified without const qualifier. However, in C++11, a constexpr specifier used in a non-static member function implies const, and thus the behavior is as if const is specified.
