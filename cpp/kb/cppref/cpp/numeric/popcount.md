Defined in header <bit>

template< class T >

constexpr int popcount( T x ) noexcept;

(since C++20)

Returns the number of 1 bits in the value of x.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if T is an unsigned integer type (that is, unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned long, unsigned long long, or an extended unsigned integer type).

### Parameters

x

-

value of unsigned integer type

### Return value

The number of 1 bits in the value of x.

### Notes

The name popcount is a contraction for "population count".

### Example

Run this code

#include <bit>
#include <bitset>
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
 
static_assert(std::popcount(0xFULL) == 4);
 
int main()
{
for (const std::uint8_t x : {0, 0b00011101, 0b11111111})
std::cout << "popcount( " << std::bitset<8>(x) << " ) = "
<< std::popcount(x) << '\n';
}

Output:

popcount( 00000000 ) = 0
popcount( 00011101 ) = 4
popcount( 11111111 ) = 8
