Additional overloads

Defined in header <cmath>

template< class Integer >

double      sph_legendre ( unsigned l, unsigned m, Integer theta );

(A)
(since C++17)

1-3) Computes the spherical associated Legendre function of degree l, order m, and polar angle theta. The library provides overloads of std::sph_legendre for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter theta.(since C++23)

A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double.

### Parameters

l

-

degree

m

-

order

theta

-

polar angle, measured in radians

### Return value

If no errors occur, returns the value of the spherical associated Legendre function (that is, spherical harmonic with ϕ = 0) of l, m, and theta, where the spherical harmonic function is defined as Ym
l(theta,ϕ) = (-1)m
[ (2l+1)(l-m)!
4π(l+m)!

]1/2
Pm
l(cos(theta))eimϕ
where Pm
l(x) is std::assoc_legendre(l, m, x)) and |m|≤l.
Note that the Condon-Shortley phase term (-1)m
is included in this definition because it is omitted from the definition of Pm
l in std::assoc_legendre.

### Error handling

Errors may be reported as specified in math_errhandling.

- If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned and domain error is not reported.

- If l≥128, the behavior is implementation-defined.

### Notes

Implementations that do not support C++17, but support ISO 29124:2010, provide this function if __STDCPP_MATH_SPEC_FUNCS__ is defined by the implementation to a value at least 201003L and if the user defines __STDCPP_WANT_MATH_SPEC_FUNCS__ before including any standard library headers.

Implementations that do not support ISO 29124:2010 but support TR 19768:2007 (TR1), provide this function in the header tr1/cmath and namespace std::tr1.

An implementation of the spherical harmonic function is available in boost.math, and it reduces to this function when called with the parameter phi set to zero.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, std::sph_legendre(int_num1, int_num2, num) has the same effect as std::sph_legendre(int_num1, int_num2, static_cast<double>(num)).

### Example

Run this code

#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <numbers>
 
int main()
{
// spot check for l=3, m=0
double x = 1.2345;
std::cout << "Y_3^0(" << x << ") = " << std::sph_legendre(3, 0, x) << '\n';
 
// exact solution
std::cout << "exact solution = "
<< 0.25 * std::sqrt(7 / std::numbers::pi)
* (5 * std::pow(std::cos(x), 3) - 3 * std::cos(x))
<< '\n';
}

Output:

Y_3^0(1.2345) = -0.302387
exact solution = -0.302387
