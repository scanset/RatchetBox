Additional overloads

Defined in header <cmath>

template< class Integer >

double      hermite ( unsigned int n, Integer x );

(A)
(since C++17)

1-3) Computes the (physicist's) Hermite polynomials of the degree n and argument x. The library provides overloads of std::hermite for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter x.(since C++23)

A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double.

### Parameters

n

-

the degree of the polynomial

x

-

the argument, a floating-point or integer value

### Return value

If no errors occur, value of the order-n Hermite polynomial of x, that is (-1)n
ex2
dn

dxn

e-x2
, is returned.

### Error handling

Errors may be reported as specified in math_errhandling.

- If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned and domain error is not reported.

- If n is greater or equal than 128, the behavior is implementation-defined.

### Notes

Implementations that do not support C++17, but support ISO 29124:2010, provide this function if __STDCPP_MATH_SPEC_FUNCS__ is defined by the implementation to a value at least 201003L and if the user defines __STDCPP_WANT_MATH_SPEC_FUNCS__ before including any standard library headers.

Implementations that do not support ISO 29124:2010 but support TR 19768:2007 (TR1), provide this function in the header tr1/cmath and namespace std::tr1.

An implementation of this function is also available in boost.math.

The Hermite polynomials are the polynomial solutions of the equation
u,,
-2xu,
= -2nu.

The first few are:

Function

Polynomial

hermite(0, x)    
1

hermite(1, x)
2x

hermite(2, x)
4x2
- 2

hermite(3, x)
8x3
- 12x

hermite(4, x)
    16x4
- 48x2
+ 12    

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, std::hermite(int_num, num) has the same effect as std::hermite(int_num, static_cast<double>(num)).

### Example

Run this code

#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
 
double H3(double x)
{
return 8 * std::pow(x, 3) - 12 * x;
}
 
double H4(double x)
{
return 16 * std::pow(x, 4) - 48 * x * x + 12;
}
 
int main()
{
// spot-checks
std::cout << std::hermite(3, 10) << '=' << H3(10) << '\n'
<< std::hermite(4, 10) << '=' << H4(10) << '\n';
}

Output:

7880=7880
155212=155212
