Additional overloads (since C++11)

Defined in header <cmath>

template< class Integer >

double      ceil ( Integer num );

(A)
(constexpr since C++23)

1-3) Computes the least integer value not less than num. The library provides overloads of std::ceil for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter.(since C++23)

S) The SIMD overload performs an element-wise std::ceil on v_num.

(See math-floating-point and deduced-simd-t for their definitions.)

(since C++26)

A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double.

(since C++11)

### Parameters

num

-

floating point or integer value

### Return value

If no errors occur, the smallest integer value not less than num, that is ⌈num⌉, is returned.

Return value

num

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- The current rounding mode has no effect.

- If num is ±∞, it is returned unmodified.

- If num is ±0, it is returned, unmodified.

- If num is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

FE_INEXACT may be (but is not required to be) raised when rounding a non-integer finite value.

The largest representable floating-point values are exact integers in all standard floating-point formats, so this function never overflows on its own; however the result may overflow any integer type (including std::intmax_t), when stored in an integer variable. It is for this reason that the return type is floating-point not integral.

This function (for double argument) behaves as if (except for the freedom to not raise FE_INEXACT) implemented by the following code:

#include <cfenv>
#include <cmath>
#pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
 
double ceil(double x)
{
int save_round = std::fegetround();
std::fesetround(FE_UPWARD);
double result = std::rint(x); // or std::nearbyint
std::fesetround(save_round);
return result;
}

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, std::ceil(num) has the same effect as std::ceil(static_cast<double>(num)).

### Example

Run this code

#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::cout << std::fixed
<< "ceil(+2.4) = " << std::ceil(+2.4) << '\n'
<< "ceil(-2.4) = " << std::ceil(-2.4) << '\n'
<< "ceil(-0.0) = " << std::ceil(-0.0) << '\n'
<< "ceil(-Inf) = " << std::ceil(-INFINITY) << '\n';
}

Output:

ceil(+2.4) = 3.000000
ceil(-2.4) = -2.000000
ceil(-0.0) = -0.000000
ceil(-Inf) = -inf
