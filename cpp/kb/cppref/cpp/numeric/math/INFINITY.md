Defined in header <cmath>

#define INFINITY /*implementation defined*/

(since C++11)

If the implementation supports floating-point infinities, the macro INFINITY expands to constant expression of type float which evaluates to positive or unsigned infinity.

If the implementation does not support floating-point infinities, the macro INFINITY expands to a positive value that is guaranteed to overflow a float at compile time, and the use of this macro generates a compiler warning.
