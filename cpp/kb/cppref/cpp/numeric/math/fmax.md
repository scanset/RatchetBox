1-3) Returns the larger of two floating point arguments, treating NaNs as missing data (between a NaN and a numeric value, the numeric value is chosen). The library provides overloads of std::fmax for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameters.(since C++23)

S) The SIMD overload performs an element-wise std::fmax on v_xand v_y.

(See math-common-simd-t for its definition.)

(since C++26)

A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double.

(since C++11)

### Parameters

x, y

-

floating-point or integer values

### Return value

If successful, returns the larger of two floating point values. The value returned is exact and does not depend on any rounding modes.

### Error handling

This function is not subject to any of the error conditions specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- If one of the two arguments is NaN, the value of the other argument is returned.

- Only if both arguments are NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

This function is not required to be sensitive to the sign of zero, although some implementations additionally enforce that if one argument is +0 and the other is -0, then +0 is returned.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their first argument num1 and second argument num2:

- If num1 or num2 has type long double, then std::fmax(num1, num2) has the same effect as std::fmax(static_cast<long double>(num1),
          static_cast<long double>(num2)).

- Otherwise, if num1 and/or num2 has type double or an integer type, then std::fmax(num1, num2) has the same effect as std::fmax(static_cast<double>(num1),
          static_cast<double>(num2)).

- Otherwise, if num1 or num2 has type float, then std::fmax(num1, num2) has the same effect as std::fmax(static_cast<float>(num1),
          static_cast<float>(num2)).

(until C++23)

If num1 and num2 have arithmetic types, then std::fmax(num1, num2) has the same effect as std::fmax(static_cast</*common-floating-point-type*/>(num1),
          static_cast</*common-floating-point-type*/>(num2)), where /*common-floating-point-type*/ is the floating-point type with the greatest floating-point conversion rank and greatest floating-point conversion subrank between the types of num1 and num2, arguments of integer type are considered to have the same floating-point conversion rank as double.

If no such floating-point type with the greatest rank and subrank exists, then overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate from the overloads provided.

(since C++23)

### Example

Run this code

#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::cout << "fmax(2,1) = " << std::fmax(2, 1) << '\n'
<< "fmax(-Inf,0) = " << std::fmax(-INFINITY, 0) << '\n'
<< "fmax(NaN,-1) = " << std::fmax(NAN, -1) << '\n';
}

Output:

fmax(2,1) = 2
fmax(-Inf,0) = 0
fmax(NaN,-1) = -1
