Defined in header <cmath>

template< class Integer >

double      nearbyint ( Integer num );

(A)

1-3) Rounds the floating-point argument num to an integer value in floating-point format, using the current rounding mode. The library provides overloads of std::nearbyint for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter.(since C++23)

S) The SIMD overload performs an element-wise std::nearbyint on v_num.

(See math-floating-point and deduced-simd-t for their definitions.)

(since C++26)

A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double.

(since C++11)

### Parameters

num

-

floating-point or integer value

### Return value

The nearest integer value to num, according to the current rounding mode, is returned.

### Error handling

This function is not subject to any of the errors specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- FE_INEXACT is never raised.

- If num is ±∞, it is returned, unmodified.

- If num is ±0, it is returned, unmodified.

- If num is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

The only difference between std::nearbyint and std::rint is that std::nearbyint never raises FE_INEXACT.

The largest representable floating-point values are exact integers in all standard floating-point formats, so std::nearbyint never overflows on its own; however the result may overflow any integer type (including std::intmax_t), when stored in an integer variable.

If the current rounding mode is FE_TONEAREST, this function rounds to even in halfway cases (like std::rint, but unlike std::round).

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, std::nearbyint(num) has the same effect as std::nearbyint(static_cast<double>(num)).

### Example

Run this code

#include <cfenv>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
 
int main()
{
std::fesetround(FE_TONEAREST);
std::cout << "rounding to nearest: \n"
<< "nearbyint(+2.3) = " << std::nearbyint(2.3)
<< " nearbyint(+2.5) = " << std::nearbyint(2.5)
<< " nearbyint(+3.5) = " << std::nearbyint(3.5) << '\n'
<< "nearbyint(-2.3) = " << std::nearbyint(-2.3)
<< " nearbyint(-2.5) = " << std::nearbyint(-2.5)
<< " nearbyint(-3.5) = " << std::nearbyint(-3.5) << '\n';
 
std::fesetround(FE_DOWNWARD);
std::cout << "rounding down:\n"
<< "nearbyint(+2.3) = " << std::nearbyint(2.3)
<< " nearbyint(+2.5) = " << std::nearbyint(2.5)
<< " nearbyint(+3.5) = " << std::nearbyint(3.5) << '\n'
<< "nearbyint(-2.3) = " << std::nearbyint(-2.3)
<< " nearbyint(-2.5) = " << std::nearbyint(-2.5)
<< " nearbyint(-3.5) = " << std::nearbyint(-3.5) << '\n';
 
std::cout << "nearbyint(-0.0) = " << std::nearbyint(-0.0) << '\n'
<< "nearbyint(-Inf) = " << std::nearbyint(-INFINITY) << '\n';
}

Output:

rounding to nearest: 
nearbyint(+2.3) = 2 nearbyint(+2.5) = 2 nearbyint(+3.5) = 4
nearbyint(-2.3) = -2 nearbyint(-2.5) = -2 nearbyint(-3.5) = -4
rounding down:
nearbyint(+2.3) = 2 nearbyint(+2.5) = 2 nearbyint(+3.5) = 3
nearbyint(-2.3) = -3 nearbyint(-2.5) = -3 nearbyint(-3.5) = -4
nearbyint(-0.0) = -0
nearbyint(-Inf) = -inf
