Additional overloads (since C++11)

Defined in header <cmath>

template< class Integer >

double      erfc ( Integer num );

(A)
(constexpr since C++26)

1-3) Computes the complementary error function of num, that is 1.0 - std::erf(num), but without loss of precision for large num. The library provides overloads of std::erfc for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter.(since C++23)

S) The SIMD overload performs an element-wise std::erfc on v_num.

(See math-floating-point and deduced-simd-t for their definitions.)

(since C++26)

A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double.

(since C++11)

### Parameters

num

-

floating-point or integer value

### Return value

If no errors occur, value of the complementary error function of num, that is \(\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi} }\int_{num}^{\infty}{e^{-{t^2} }\mathsf{d}t}\) 2
√π

∫∞
nume-t2
dt or \({\small 1-\operatorname{erf}(num)}\)1-erf(num), is returned.
If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result (after rounding) is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- If the argument is +∞, +0 is returned.

- If the argument is -∞, 2 is returned.

- If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

For the IEEE-compatible type double, underflow is guaranteed if num > 26.55.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, std::erfc(num) has the same effect as std::erfc(static_cast<double>(num)).

### Example

Run this code

#include <cmath>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
 
double normalCDF(double x) // Phi(-∞, x) aka N(x)
{
return std::erfc(-x / std::sqrt(2)) / 2;
}
 
int main()
{
std::cout << "normal cumulative distribution function:\n"
<< std::fixed << std::setprecision(2);
for (double n = 0; n < 1; n += 0.1)
std::cout << "normalCDF(" << n << ") = " << 100 * normalCDF(n) << "%\n";
 
std::cout << "special values:\n"
<< "erfc(-Inf) = " << std::erfc(-INFINITY) << '\n'
<< "erfc(Inf) = " << std::erfc(INFINITY) << '\n';
}

Output:

normal cumulative distribution function:
normalCDF(0.00) = 50.00%
normalCDF(0.10) = 53.98%
normalCDF(0.20) = 57.93%
normalCDF(0.30) = 61.79%
normalCDF(0.40) = 65.54%
normalCDF(0.50) = 69.15%
normalCDF(0.60) = 72.57%
normalCDF(0.70) = 75.80%
normalCDF(0.80) = 78.81%
normalCDF(0.90) = 81.59%
normalCDF(1.00) = 84.13%
special values:
erfc(-Inf) = 2.00
erfc(Inf) = 0.00
