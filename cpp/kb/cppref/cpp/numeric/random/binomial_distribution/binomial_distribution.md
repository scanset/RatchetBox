binomial_distribution() : binomial_distribution(1) {}

(1)
(since C++11)

explicit binomial_distribution( IntType t, double p = 0.5 );

(2)
(since C++11)

explicit binomial_distribution( const param_type& params );

(3)
(since C++11)

Constructs a new distribution object.

2) Uses t and p as the distribution parameters.

3) Uses params as the distribution parameter.

### Parameters

t

-

the t distribution parameter (number of trials)

p

-

the p distribution parameter (probability of a trial generating true)

params

-

the distribution parameter set

### Notes

Requires that 0 ≤ p ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ t.
