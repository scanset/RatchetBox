Defined in header <random>

    class Engine,

    std::size_t W,

    class UIntType

> class independent_bits_engine;

(since C++11)

independent_bits_engine is a random number engine adaptor that produces random numbers with different number of bits than that of the wrapped engine.

### Template parameters

Engine

-

the type of the wrapped engine

W

-

the number of bits the generated numbers should have

UIntType

-

the type of the generated random numbers. The effect is undefined unless the parameter is cv-unqualified and is one of unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned long, or unsigned long long.

Type requirements

-

Engine must meet the requirements of RandomNumberEngine.

-

W must be greater than zero, and no greater than std::numeric_limits<UIntType>::digits.

### Member types

Member type

Definition

result_type (C++11)

UIntType

### Member functions

(constructor)

(C++11)

constructs the engine adaptor 
(public member function)

seed

(C++11)

sets the state of the underlying engine 
(public member function)

base

(C++11)

returns the underlying engine 
(public member function)

#### Generation 

operator()

(C++11)

advances the state of the underlying engine and returns the generated value 
(public member function)

discard

(C++11)

advances the adaptor's state by a specified amount 
(public member function)

#### Characteristics 

min

[static] (C++11)

gets the smallest possible value in the output range (always zero). 
(public static member function)

max

[static] (C++11)

gets the largest possible value in the output range (always 2w
- 1). 
(public static member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator!=

(C++11)(C++11)(removed in C++20)

compares the internal states of the adaptors and underlying engines 
(function)

operator<<operator>>

(C++11)

performs stream input and output on pseudo-random number engine adaptor 
(function)
