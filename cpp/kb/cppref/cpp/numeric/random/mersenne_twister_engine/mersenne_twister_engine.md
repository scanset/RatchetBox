Constructs the pseudo-random number engine.

1) The default constructor.

- If the default-constructed engine is of type std::mt19937, the 10000th consecutive invocation of it produces the value 4123659995.

- If the default-constructed engine is of type std::mt19937_64, the 10000th consecutive invocation of it produces the value 9981545732273789042.

2) Constructs the engine with a seed value value. Given \(\scriptsize 2^w \)2w
as p, the engine's initial state is determined as follows:

- Sets \(\scriptsize X_{-n} \)X-n to value % p.

- For each integer i in [i - n, -1], sets \(\scriptsize X_i \)Xi to \(\scriptsize [f \cdot (X_{i-1}\ \mathsf{xor}\ (X_{i-1}\ \mathsf{rshift}\ (w-2)))+i \mod n] \mod p \)[f·(Xi-1 xor (Xi-1 rshift (w-2)))+i mod n] mod p, where \(\scriptsize \mathsf{xor} \)xor and \(\scriptsize \mathsf{rshift} \)rshift stand for built-in bitwise XOR and bitwise right-shift respectively.

3) Constructs the engine with a seed sequence seq. Given std::size_t(w / 32) + 1 as k, the engine's initial state is determined as follows:

- Creates an invented array object a of length n * k.

- Calls seq.generate(a + 0, a + n * k).

- For each integer i in [-n, -1], sets \(\scriptsize X_{i} \)Xi to \(\scriptsize (\sum^{k-1}_{j=0} a_{k(i+n)+j} \cdot 2^{32j}) \mod 2^w \)(∑k-1
j=0 ak(i+n)+j·232j
) mod 2w
.

- If the most significant w − r bits of \(\scriptsize X_{-n} \)X-n are zero, and if each of the other resulting \(\scriptsize X_{i} \)Xi is ​0​, changes \(\scriptsize X_{-n} \)X-n to \(\scriptsize 2^{w-1} \)2w-1
.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if SeedSeq meets the requirements of SeedSequence.

4) The copy constructor. Upon construction, *this == other is true.

### Parameters

value

-

seed value to use in the initialization of the internal state

seq

-

seed sequence to use in the initialization of the internal state

### Complexity

1,2) \(\scriptsize O(n) \)O(n).

3) Same as the complexity of the seq.generate call.

4) \(\scriptsize O(n) \)O(n).

### Exceptions

3) If SeedSeq is not std::seed_seq, throws the exceptions thrown by the seq.generate call.

### Example

This section is incomplete
Reason: demos for overloads (2-4) required

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <random>
 
int main()
{
std::mt19937 gen32; // overload (1)
std::mt19937_64 gen64; // overload (1)
gen32.discard(10000 - 1);
gen64.discard(10000 - 1);
assert(gen32() == 4123659995);
assert(gen64() == 9981545732273789042ull);
}
