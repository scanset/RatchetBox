friend bool operator==( const linear_congruential_engine& lhs,

                        const linear_congruential_engine& rhs );

(1)
(since C++11)

friend bool operator!=( const linear_congruential_engine& lhs,

                        const linear_congruential_engine& rhs );

(2)
(since C++11) 
(until C++20)

Compares two pseudo-random number engines. Two engines are equal, if their internal states are equivalent, that is, if they would generate equivalent values for any number of calls of operator().

These functions are not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::linear_congruential_engine<UIntType, a, c, m> is an associated class of the arguments.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

(since C++20)
