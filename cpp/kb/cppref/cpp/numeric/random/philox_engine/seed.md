void seed( result_type value = default_seed );

(1)
(since C++26)

template< class SeedSeq > 

void seed( SeedSeq& seq );

(2)
(since C++26)

Sets the state of the random-number engine.

1) Right after the state is set, *this == std::philox_engine(value) is true.

2) Right after the state is set, *this == std::philox_engine(seq) is true.

### Parameters

value

-

seed value to use to set the state

seq

-

seed sequence to use to set the state

### Exceptions

2) If SeedSeq is not std::seed_seq, throws the exceptions thrown by the seq.generate call.

### Complexity

1) Same as std::philox_engine(value).

2) Same as std::philox_engine(seq).
