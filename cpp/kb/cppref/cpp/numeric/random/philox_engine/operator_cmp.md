friend bool operator==( const philox_engine& lhs, const philox_engine& rhs );

(since C++26)

Compares two pseudo-random number engines. Two engines are equal, if their internal states are equivalent, that is, if they would generate equivalent values for any number of calls of operator().

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when decltype(*this) is an associated class of the arguments.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

engines to compare

### Return value

true if the engines are equal, false otherwise.
