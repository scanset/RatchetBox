negative_binomial_distribution() : negative_binomial_distribution(1) {}

(1)
(since C++11)

explicit negative_binomial_distribution( IntType k, double p = 0.5 );

(2)
(since C++11)

explicit negative_binomial_distribution( const param_type& params );

(3)
(since C++11)

Constructs a new distribution object.

2) Uses k and p as the distribution parameters.

3) Uses params as the distribution parameters.

### Parameters

k

-

the k distribution parameter (number of trial successes)

p

-

the p distribution parameter (probability of a trial generating true)

params

-

the distribution parameter set

### Notes

Requires that 0 < p ≤ 1 and 0 < k.

If p == 1, subsequent calls to the operator() overload that does not accept a param_type object will cause undefined behavior.

The default-constructed std::negative_binomial_distribution is equivalent to the default-constructed std::geometric_distribution.
