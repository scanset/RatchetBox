Compares two distribution objects. Two distribution objects are equal when parameter values and internal state is the same.

1) Compares two distribution objects for equality.

2) Compares two distribution objects for inequality.

These functions are not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::lognormal_distribution<ResultType> is an associated class of the arguments.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

(since C++20)

### Parameters
