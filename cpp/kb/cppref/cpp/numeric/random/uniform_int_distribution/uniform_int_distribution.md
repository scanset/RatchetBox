uniform_int_distribution() : uniform_int_distribution(0) { }

(1)
(since C++11)

explicit uniform_int_distribution( IntType a, 

                                   IntType b = std::numeric_limits<IntType>::max() );

(2)
(since C++11)

explicit uniform_int_distribution( const param_type& params );

(3)
(since C++11)

Constructs new distribution object.

2) Uses a and b as the distribution parameters.

3) Uses params as the distribution parameters.

The behavior is undefined if a > b.

### Parameters

a

-

the a distribution parameter (minimum value)

b

-

the b distribution parameter (maximum value)

params

-

the distribution parameter set
