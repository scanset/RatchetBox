(1)
(since C++11)

explicit exponential_distribution( RealType lambda );

(2)
(since C++11)

explicit exponential_distribution( const param_type& params );

(3)
(since C++11)

Constructs a new distribution object.

2) Uses lambda as the distribution parameter.

3) Uses params as the distribution parameter.

### Parameters

lambda

-

the λ distribution parameter (the rate parameter)

params

-

the distribution parameter set

### Notes

Requires that 0 < lambda.
