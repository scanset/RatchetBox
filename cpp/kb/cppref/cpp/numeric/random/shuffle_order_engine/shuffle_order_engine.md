(since C++11)

template< class SeedSeq >

explicit shuffle_order_engine( SeedSeq& seq );

(3)
(since C++11)

explicit shuffle_order_engine( const Engine& e );

(4)
(since C++11)

explicit shuffle_order_engine( Engine&& e );

(5)
(since C++11)

Constructs new pseudo-random engine adaptor.

1) Default constructor. The underlying engine is also default-constructed.

2) Constructs the underlying engine with s.

3) Constructs the underlying engine with seed sequence seq. 

This overload participates in overload resolution only if Sseq satisfies the requirements of SeedSequence.

4) Constructs the underlying engine with a copy of e.

5) Move-constructs the underlying engine with e. e holds unspecified, but valid state afterwards.

### Parameters

s

-

integer value to construct the underlying engine with

seq

-

seed sequence to construct the underlying engine with

e

-

pseudo-random number engine to initialize with

### Exceptions

3) If SeedSeq is not std::seed_seq, throws the exceptions thrown by the seq.generate call.
