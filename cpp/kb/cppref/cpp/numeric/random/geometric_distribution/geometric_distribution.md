geometric_distribution() : geometric_distribution(0.5) {}

(1)
(since C++11)

explicit geometric_distribution( double p );

(2)
(since C++11)

explicit geometric_distribution( const param_type& params );

(3)
(since C++11)

Constructs a new distribution object.

2) Uses p as the distribution parameter.

3) Uses params as the distribution parameter.

### Parameters

p

-

the p distribution parameter (probability of a trial generating true)

params

-

the distribution parameter set

### Notes

Requires that 0 < p < 1.
