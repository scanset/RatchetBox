Defined in header <random>

class seed_seq;

(since C++11)

std::seed_seq consumes a sequence of integer-valued data and produces a requested number of 32-bit unsigned integer values, based on the consumed data. The produced values are distributed over the entire 32-bit range even if the consumed values are close.

It provides a way to seed a large number of random number engines or to seed a generator that requires a lot of entropy, given a small seed or a poorly distributed initial seed sequence.

std::seed_seq meets the requirements of SeedSequence.

### Nested types

std::uint_least32_t

### Data members

Member

Description

std::vector<result_type> v

the underlying seed sequence
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs and seeds the std::seed_seq object 
(public member function)

operator=

[deleted]

std::seed_seq is not assignable 
(public member function)

generate

calculates the bias-eliminated, evenly distributed 32-bit values 
(public member function)

size

obtains the number of stored 32-bit values 
(public member function)

param

copies all stored 32-bit values 
(public member function)

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
#include <random>
 
int main()
{
std::seed_seq seq{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
std::vector<std::uint32_t> seeds(10);
seq.generate(seeds.begin(), seeds.end());
for (std::uint32_t n : seeds)
std::cout << n << '\n';
}
