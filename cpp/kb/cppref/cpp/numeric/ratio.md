The class template std::ratio and associated templates provide compile-time rational arithmetic support. Each instantiation of this template exactly represents any finite rational number.

### Compile-time fractions

Defined in header <ratio> 

ratio

(C++11)

represents exact rational fraction 
(class template)

The following convenience typedefs that correspond to the SI ratios are provided by the standard library:
