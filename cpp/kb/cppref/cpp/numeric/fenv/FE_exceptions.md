FE_UNDERFLOW

(since C++11)

All these macro constants (except FE_ALL_EXCEPT) expand to integer constant expressions that are distinct powers of 2, which uniquely identify all supported floating-point exceptions. Each macro is defined only if it is supported.

The macro constant FE_ALL_EXCEPT, which expands to the bitwise OR of all other FE_*, is always defined and is zero if floating-point exceptions are not supported by the implementation.

Constant

Explanation

FE_DIVBYZERO

pole error occurred in an earlier floating-point operation

FE_INEXACT

inexact result: rounding was necessary to store the result of an earlier floating-point operation

FE_INVALID

domain error occurred in an earlier floating-point operation

FE_OVERFLOW

the result of the earlier floating-point operation was too large to be representable

FE_UNDERFLOW

the result of the earlier floating-point operation was subnormal with a loss of precision

FE_ALL_EXCEPT

bitwise OR of all supported floating-point exceptions

The implementation may define additional macro constants in <cfenv> to identify additional floating-point exceptions. All such constants begin with FE_ followed by at least one uppercase letter.

See math_errhandling for further details.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cfenv>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
 
// #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
 
volatile double zero = 0.0; // volatile not needed where FENV_ACCESS is supported
volatile double one = 1.0; // volatile not needed where FENV_ACCESS is supported
 
int main()
{
std::feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
std::cout << "1.0/0.0 = " << 1.0 / zero << '\n';
if (std::fetestexcept(FE_DIVBYZERO))
std::cout << "division by zero reported\n";
else
std::cout << "division by zero not reported\n";
 
std::feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
std::cout << "1.0/10 = " << one / 10 << '\n';
if (std::fetestexcept(FE_INEXACT))
std::cout << "inexact result reported\n";
else
std::cout << "inexact result not reported\n";
 
std::feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
std::cout << "sqrt(-1) = " << std::sqrt(-1) << '\n';
if (std::fetestexcept(FE_INVALID))
std::cout << "invalid result reported\n";
else
std::cout << "invalid result not reported\n";
}

Possible output:

1.0/0.0 = inf
division by zero reported
1.0/10 = 0.1
inexact result reported
sqrt(-1) = -nan
invalid result reported
