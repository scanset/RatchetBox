int fegetexceptflag( std::fexcept_t* flagp, int excepts );

(1)
(since C++11)

int fesetexceptflag( const std::fexcept_t* flagp, int excepts );

(2)
(since C++11)

1) Attempts to obtain the full contents of the floating-point exception flags that are listed in the bitmask argument excepts, which is a bitwise OR of the floating point exception macros. 

2) Attempts to copy the full contents of the floating-point exception flags that are listed in excepts from flagp into the floating-point environment. Does not raise any exceptions, only modifies the flags.

The full contents of a floating-point exception flag is not necessarily a boolean value indicating whether the exception is raised or cleared. For example, it may be a struct which includes the boolean status and the address of the code that triggered the exception. These functions obtain all such content and obtain/store it in flagp in implementation-defined format.

### Parameters

flagp

-

pointer to an std::fexcept_t object where the flags will be stored or read from

excepts

-

bitmask listing the exception flags to get/set

### Return value

​0​ on success, non-zero otherwise.
