int feupdateenv( const std::fenv_t* envp )

(since C++11)

First, remembers the currently raised floating-point exceptions, then restores the floating-point environment from the object pointed to by envp (similar to std::fesetenv), then raises the floating-point exceptions that were saved.

This function may be used to end the non-stop mode established by an earlier call to std::feholdexcept.

### Parameters

envp

-

pointer to the object of type std::fenv_t set by an earlier call to std::feholdexcept or std::fegetenv or equal to FE_DFL_ENV

### Return value
