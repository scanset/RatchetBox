The C++ numerics library includes common mathematical functions and types, as well as optimized numeric arrays and support for random number generation.

## Mathematical functions and types

### Common mathematical functions

The header <cmath> provides standard C library mathematical functions such as std::fabs, std::sqrt, and std::sin.

### Mathematical special functions (since C++17)

The header <cmath> also provides several mathematical special functions such as std::beta, std::hermite, and std::cyl_bessel_i.

### Mathematical constants (since C++20)

The header <numbers> provides several mathematical constants, such as std::numbers::pi or std::numbers::sqrt2

### Basic linear algebra algorithms (since C++26)

The header <linalg> provides basic linear algebra algorithms which are based on BLAS.

### Data-parallel types (since C++26)

The header <simd> provides portable types for explicitly stating data-parallelism and structuring data for more efficient SIMD access.

### Complex number arithmetic

Defined in header <complex> 

complex

a complex number type 
(class template)

### Numeric arrays

Defined in header <valarray> 

valarray

numeric arrays, array masks and array slices 
(class template)

## Numeric algorithms

The header <numeric> provides numeric algorithms below:

### Factor operations (since C++17)

Defined in header <numeric> 

gcd

(C++17)

computes the greatest common divisor of two integers 
(function template)

lcm

(C++17)

computes the least common multiple of two integers 
(function template)

### Interpolation operations (C++20)

Defined in header <numeric> 

midpoint

(C++20)

midpoint between two numbers or pointers 
(function template)

Defined in header <cmath> 

lerp

(C++20)

linear interpolation function 
(function)

### Saturation arithmetic (since C++26)

Defined in header <numeric> 

add_sat

(C++26)

saturating addition operation on two integers 
(function template)

sub_sat

(function template)

div_sat

(C++26)

saturating division operation on two integers 
(function template)

saturate_cast

(C++26)

returns an integer value clamped to the range of another integer type 
(function template)

### Numeric operations

Defined in header <numeric> 

iota

(C++11)

fills a range with successive increments of the starting value 
(function template)

ranges::iota

(C++23)

fills a range with successive increments of the starting value
(algorithm function object)

accumulate

sums up or folds a range of elements 
(function template)

reduce

(C++17)

similar to std::accumulate, except out of order 
(function template)

transform_reduce

(C++17)

applies an invocable, then reduces out of order 
(function template)

inner_product

computes the inner product of two ranges of elements 
(function template)

adjacent_difference

computes the differences between adjacent elements in a range 
(function template)

partial_sum

computes the partial sum of a range of elements 
(function template)

inclusive_scan

(C++17)

similar to std::partial_sum, includes the ith input element in the ith sum 
(function template)

exclusive_scan

(C++17)

similar to std::partial_sum, excludes the ith input element from the ith sum 
(function template)

transform_inclusive_scan

(C++17)

applies an invocable, then calculates inclusive scan 
(function template)

transform_exclusive_scan

(C++17)

applies an invocable, then calculates exclusive scan 
(function template)

## Miscellaneous

### Pseudo-random number generation

The header <random> defines pseudo-random number generators and numerical distributions. The header <cstdlib> also includes C-style random number generation via std::srand and std::rand.

### Floating-point environment (since C++11)

The header <cfenv> defines flags and functions related to exceptional floating-point state, such as overflow and division by zero.

### Bit manipulation (since C++20)

The header <bit> provides several function templates to access, manipulate, and process individual bits and bit sequences. The byte ordering (endianness) of scalar types can be inspected via std::endian facility.
