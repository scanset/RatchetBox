(since C++23)

Specifies available file open flags. It is a BitmaskType, the following constants are defined:

Constant

Explanation

app

seek to the end of stream before each write

binary

open in binary mode

in

open for reading

out

open for writing

trunc

discard the contents of the stream when opening

ate

seek to the end of stream immediately after open

noreplace (C++23)

open in exclusive mode

### Example

Run this code

#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
const char* fname = "unique_name.txt";
 
// write to a temporary stream object
std::fstream(fname, std::ios::out | std::ios::trunc) << "Hi";
 
std::string s;
std::fstream(fname, std::ios::in) >> s;
std::cout << s << '\n';
}

Output:

Hi
