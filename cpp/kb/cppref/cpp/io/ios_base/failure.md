Defined in header <ios>

class failure;

The class std::ios_base::failure defines an exception object that is thrown on failure by the functions in the Input/Output library.

std::ios_base::failure may be defined either as a member class of std::ios_base or as a synonym (typedef) for another class with equivalent functionality.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new failure object with the given message 
(public member function)

operator=

replaces the failure object 
(public member function)

what

returns the explanatory string 
(public member function)

## std::ios_base::failure::failure

(1)

explicit failure( const std::string& message );

(until C++11)

explicit failure( const std::string& message, 

                  const std::error_code& ec = std::io_errc::stream );

(since C++11)

explicit failure( const char* message,

                  const std::error_code& ec = std::io_errc::stream );

(2)
(since C++11)

(3)

failure( const failure& other );

(until C++11)

failure( const failure& other ) noexcept;

(since C++11)

1,2) Constructs the exception object using message as explanation string which can later be retrieved using what(). ec is used to identify the specific reason for the failure.(since C++11)

3) Copy constructor. Initialize the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::ios_base::failure then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0.(since C++11)

### Parameters

message

-

explanatory string

ec

-

error code to identify the specific reason for the failure

other

-

another failure to copy

### Notes

Because copying std::ios_base::failure is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string. This is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&&: it would have to copy the content anyway.

## std::ios_base::failure::operator=

failure& operator=( const failure& other );

(until C++11)

failure& operator=( const failure& other ) noexcept;

(since C++11)

Assigns the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::ios_base::failure then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment.(since C++11)

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to assign with

### Return value

*this

## std::ios_base::failure::what

virtual const char* what() const throw();

(until C++11)

virtual const char* what() const noexcept;

(since C++11)

Returns the explanatory string.

### Return value

Pointer to an implementation-defined null-terminated string with explanatory information. The string is suitable for conversion and display as a std::wstring. The pointer is guaranteed to be valid at least until the exception object from which it is obtained is destroyed, or until a non-const member function (e.g. copy assignment operator) on the exception object is called.

The returned string is encoded with the ordinary literal encoding during constant evaluation.

(since C++26)

### Notes

Implementations are allowed but not required to override what().

## Inherited from std::system_error

### Member functions

code

returns error code 
(public member function of std::system_error)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function of std::system_error)

## Inherited from std::runtime_error

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

(destructor)

[virtual]

destroys the exception object 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

### Notes

Before the resolution of LWG issue 331, std::ios_base::failure declared a destructor without throw(), where std::exception::~exception() was declared with throw()[1]. This means the std::ios_base::failure::~failure() had a weaker exception specification. The resolution is to remove that declaration so that the non-throwing exception specification is kept.

LWG issue 363 targets the same defect and its resolution is to add throw() to the declaration of std::ios_base::failure::~failure(). That resolution was not applied due to the conflict between the two resolutions.

- ↑ The non-throwing exception specification is now applied globally across the standard library, so the destructors of standard library classes are not declared with throw() or noexcept.

### Example

Run this code

#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::ifstream f("doesn't exist");
 
try
{
f.exceptions(f.failbit);
}
catch (const std::ios_base::failure& e)
{
std::cout << "Caught an ios_base::failure.\n"
<< "Explanatory string: " << e.what() << '\n'
<< "Error code: " << e.code() << '\n';
}
}

Possible output:

Caught an ios_base::failure.
Explanatory string: ios_base::clear: unspecified iostream_category error
Error code: iostream:1
