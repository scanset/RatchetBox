Defined in header <cstdio>

int putchar( int ch );

Writes a character ch to stdout. Internally, the character is converted to unsigned char just before being written.

Equivalent to std::putc(ch, stdout).

### Parameters

ch

-

character to be written

### Return value

On success, returns the written character.

On failure, returns EOF and sets the error indicator (see std::ferror()) on stdout.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstdio>
 
int main()
{
for (char c = 'a'; c != 'z'; ++c)
std::putchar(c);
 
// putchar return value is not equal to the argument
int r = 0x1024;
std::printf("\nr = 0x%x\n", r);
r = std::putchar(r);
std::printf("\nr = 0x%x\n", r);
}

Possible output:

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy
r = 0x1024
$
r = 0x24
