typedef /* implementation-defined */ fpos_t;

std::fpos_t is a non-array complete object type, can be used to store (by std::fgetpos) and restore (by std::fsetpos) the position and multibyte parser state (if any) for a C stream.

The multibyte parser state of a wide-oriented C stream is represented by a std::mbstate_t object, whose value is stored as part of the value of a std::fpos_t object by std::fgetpos.
