Defined in header <cstdio>

int rename( const char* old_filename, const char* new_filename );

Changes the filename of a file. The file is identified by character string pointed to by old_filename. The new filename is identified by character string pointed to by new_filename.

If new_filename exists, the behavior is implementation-defined.

### Parameters

old_filename

-

pointer to a null-terminated string containing the path identifying the file to rename

new_filename

-

pointer to a null-terminated string containing the new path of the file

### Return value

​0​ upon success or non-zero value on error.

### Notes

POSIX specifies many additional details on the semantics of this function, which are reproduced in C++ by std::filesystem::rename.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
if (!std::ofstream("from.txt").put('a')) // create and write to file
{
std::perror("Error creating from.txt");
return EXIT_FAILURE;
}
 
if (std::rename("from.txt", "to.txt"))
{
std::perror("Error renaming");
return EXIT_FAILURE;
}
 
std::cout << std::ifstream("to.txt").rdbuf() << '\n'; // print file
return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

Output:

a
