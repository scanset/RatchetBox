Defined in header <cstdio>

int fputc( int ch, std::FILE* stream );

int putc( int ch, std::FILE* stream );

Writes a character ch to the given output stream stream.

Internally, the character is converted to unsigned char just before being written.

In C, putc() may be implemented as a macro, which is disallowed in C++. Therefore, calls to std::fputc() and std::putc() always have the same effect.

### Parameters

ch

-

character to be written

stream

-

output stream

### Return value

On success, returns the written character.

On failure, returns EOF and sets the error indicator (see std::ferror()) on stream.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstdio>
 
int main()
{
for (char c = 'a'; c != 'z'; c++)
std::putc(c, stdout);
 
// putchar's return value is not equal to the argument
int r = 0x102A;
std::printf("\nr = 0x%x\n", r);
 
r = std::putchar(r);
std::printf("\nr = 0x%x\n", r);
}

Possible output:

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy
r = 0x102A
*
r = 0x2A
