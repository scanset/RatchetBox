explicit basic_ostream( std::basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits>* sb );

(1)

protected:

basic_ostream( const basic_ostream& rhs ) = delete;

(2)
(since C++11)

protected:

basic_ostream( basic_ostream&& rhs );

(3)
(since C++11)

1) Constructs the basic_ostream object, assigning initial values to the base class by calling basic_ios::init(sb).

2) The copy constructor is protected, and is deleted. Output streams are not copyable.

3) The move constructor uses basic_ios<CharT, Traits>::move(rhs) to move all basic_ios members, except for the rdbuf(), from rhs into *this. This move constructor is protected: it is called by the move constructors of movable output stream classes std::basic_ofstream and std::basic_ostringstream, which know how to correctly move the associated streambuffer.

### Parameters

sb

-

streambuffer to use as output sequence

rhs

-

basic_ostream to initialize from

### Notes

Because basic_ios::init(sb) sets badbit when sb is a null pointer, and because basic_ostream::sentry does nothing if the stream is already in a failed state, writing to a stream constructed from a null pointer sb is a no-op.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <utility>
 
int main()
{
// ERROR: copy ctor is deleted
// std::ostream myout(std::cout);
 
// OK: shares buffer with cout
std::ostream myout(std::cout.rdbuf());
 
// ERROR: move constructor is protected
// std::ostream s2(std::move(std::ostringstream() << 7.1));
 
// OK: move ctor called through the derived class
std::ostringstream s2(std::ostringstream() << 7.1);
myout << s2.str() << '\n';
 
std::ostream dev_null{nullptr}; // see Notes above
dev_null << "no-op";
}

Output:

7.1
