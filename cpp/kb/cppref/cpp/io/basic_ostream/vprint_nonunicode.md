Defined in header <ostream>

void vprint_nonunicode( std::ostream& os, std::string_view fmt, std::format_args args );

(since C++23)

Behaves as FormattedOutputFunction (except that some details of error reporting differ):

- First, constructs and checks the sentry object.

- Then, initializes an automatic variable as if by std::string out = std::vformat(os.getloc(), fmt, args);.

- Finally, inserts the character sequence [out.begin(), out.end()) into os.

### Parameters

os

-

output stream to insert data into

fmt

-

an object that represents the format string. The format string consists of

- ordinary characters (except { and }), which are copied unchanged to the output,

- escape sequences {{ and }}, which are replaced with { and } respectively in the output, and

- replacement fields.

Each replacement field has the following format:

{ arg-id (optional) }

(1)

{ arg-id (optional) : format-spec }

(2)

1) replacement field without a format specification

2) replacement field with a format specification

arg-id

-

specifies the index of the argument in args whose value is to be used for formatting; if it is omitted, the arguments are used in order.
The arg-id ﻿s in a format string must all be present or all be omitted. Mixing manual and automatic indexing is an error.

format-spec

-

the format specification defined by the std::formatter specialization for the corresponding argument. Cannot start with }.

- For basic types and standard string types, the format specification is interpreted as standard format specification.

- For chrono types, the format specification is interpreted as chrono format specification.

- For range types, the format specification is interpreted as range format specification.

- For std::pair and std::tuple, the format specification is interpreted as tuple format specification.

- For std::thread::id and std::stacktrace_entry, see thread id format specification and stacktrace entry format specification.

- For std::basic_stacktrace, no format specifier is allowed.

(since C++23)

- For std::filesystem::path, see path format specification.

(since C++26)

- For other formattable types, the format specification is determined by user-defined formatter specializations.

args

-

arguments to be formatted

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

- std::bad_alloc on allocation failure.

- Propagate any exception thrown by any formatter, e.g. std::format_error, without regard to the value of os.exceptions() and without turning on ios_base::badbit in the error state of os.

- May throw ios_base::failure caused by os.setstate(ios_base::badbit) which is called if an insertion into os fails.
