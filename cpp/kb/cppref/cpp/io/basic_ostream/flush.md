basic_ostream& flush();

Writes uncommitted changes to the underlying output sequence. Behaves as an UnformattedOutputFunction.

If rdbuf() is a null pointer, the sentry object is not constructed.

Otherwise, after constructing and checking the sentry object, calls rdbuf()->pubsync(). If the call returns -1, calls setstate(badbit).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

*this

### Exceptions

May throw std::ios_base::failure if (exceptions() & badbit) != 0.

### Example

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
 
using namespace std::chrono_literals;
 
void f()
{
std::cout << "Output from thread... ";
for (int i{1}; i != 10; ++i)
{
std::this_thread::sleep_for(250ms);
std::cout << i << ' ';
 
// output three numbers at once;
// the effect is observable only in real-time
if (0 == (i % 3))
std::cout.flush();
}
std::cout << std::endl; // flushes as well
}
 
int main()
{
std::thread tr{f};
std::this_thread::sleep_for(150ms);
std::clog << "Output from main\n";
tr.join();
}

Output:

Output from main
Output from thread... 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
