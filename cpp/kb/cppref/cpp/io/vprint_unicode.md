void vprint_unicode_buffered( std::FILE* stream,

                              std::string_view fmt, std::format_args args );

(2)
(since C++23)

void vprint_unicode_buffered( std::string_view fmt, std::format_args args );

(3)
(since C++23)

Format args according to the format string fmt, and writes the result to the output stream.

1) Performs the following operations in order:

- Locks stream.

- Let out denote the character representation of formatting arguments provided by args formatted according to specifications given in fmt.

- Writes out to stream:

- If stream refers to a terminal that is only capable of displaying Unicode via a native Unicode API, flushes stream and writes out to the terminal using the native Unicode API.

- Otherwise, writes unmodified out to the stream.

Unconditionally unlocks stream on function exit.

If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined:

- stream is not a valid pointer to an output C stream.

- out contains invalid Unicode code units when the native Unicode API is used.

2) Equivalent to std::string out = std::vformat(fmt, args);
std::vprint_unicode(stream, "{}", std::make_format_args(out));.

3) Equivalent to std::vprint_unicode_buffered(stdout, fmt, args).

### Parameters

stream

-

output file stream to write to

fmt

-

an object that represents the format string. The format string consists of

- ordinary characters (except { and }), which are copied unchanged to the output,

- escape sequences {{ and }}, which are replaced with { and } respectively in the output, and

- replacement fields.

Each replacement field has the following format:

{ arg-id (optional) }

(1)

{ arg-id (optional) : format-spec }

(2)

1) replacement field without a format specification

2) replacement field with a format specification

arg-id

-

specifies the index of the argument in args whose value is to be used for formatting; if it is omitted, the arguments are used in order.
The arg-id ﻿s in a format string must all be present or all be omitted. Mixing manual and automatic indexing is an error.

format-spec

-

the format specification defined by the std::formatter specialization for the corresponding argument. Cannot start with }.

- For basic types and standard string types, the format specification is interpreted as standard format specification.

- For chrono types, the format specification is interpreted as chrono format specification.

- For range types, the format specification is interpreted as range format specification.

- For std::pair and std::tuple, the format specification is interpreted as tuple format specification.

- For std::thread::id and std::stacktrace_entry, see thread id format specification and stacktrace entry format specification.

- For std::basic_stacktrace, no format specifier is allowed.

(since C++23)

- For std::filesystem::path, see path format specification.

(since C++26)

- For other formattable types, the format specification is determined by user-defined formatter specializations.

args

-

arguments to be formatted

### Exceptions

- std::bad_alloc on allocation failure.

- std::system_error, if writing to the stream fails.

- Propagates any exception thrown by used formatters, e.g. std::format_error.

### Notes

The C++ standard encourages the implementers to produce a diagnostic message if out contains invalid Unicode code units.

On POSIX, writing to a terminal is done using the usual standard I/O functions, so there is no need to treat a terminal differently to any other file stream.

On Windows, the stream refers to a terminal if GetConsoleMode(_get_osfhandle(_fileno(stream))) returns nonzero (see Windows documentation for GetConsoleMode, _get_osfhandle, and _fileno). The native Unicode API on Windows is WriteConsoleW.

If invoking the native Unicode API requires transcoding, the invalid code units are substituted with U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (see "The Unicode Standard - Core Specification", Chapter 3.9).

terminal referred to by stream can display Unicode

only used if the terminal can only use
the native Unicode API to display Unicode
