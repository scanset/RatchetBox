Defined in header <iomanip>

/* unspecified */ setw( int n );

When used in an expression out << std::setw(n) or in >> std::setw(n), sets the width parameter of the stream out or in to exactly n.

Some operations reset the width to zero (see below), so std::setw may need to be repeatedly called to set the width for multiple operations.

### Parameters

n

-

new value for width

### Return value

An object of unspecified type such that

- if out is an object of type std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>, the expression out << setw(n)
has type std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&

- has value out

- behaves as if it called f(out, n)

- if in is an object of type std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>, the expression in >> setw(n)
has type std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>&

- has value in

- behaves as if it called f(in, n)

where the function f is defined as:

void f(std::ios_base& str, int n)
{
// set width
str.width(n);
}

### Notes

The width property of the stream will be reset to zero (meaning "unspecified") if any of the following functions are called:

- Input

- operator>>(basic_istream&, basic_string&)

- operator>>(basic_istream&, char*)

- Output

- Overloads of basic_ostream::operator<<() that take arithmetic types or void pointers (at Stage 3 of num_put::put())

- operator<<(basic_ostream&, char) and operator<<(basic_ostream&, char*)

- operator<<(basic_ostream&, basic_string&)

- std::put_money (inside money_put::put())

- std::quoted (when used with an output stream)

The exact effects this modifier has on the input and output vary between the individual I/O functions and are described at each operator<< and operator>> overload page individually.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
std::cout << "no setw: [" << 42 << "]\n"
<< "setw(6): [" << std::setw(6) << 42 << "]\n"
<< "no setw, several elements: [" << 89 << 12 << 34 << "]\n"
<< "setw(6), several elements: [" << 89 << std::setw(6) << 12 << 34 << "]\n";
 
std::istringstream is("hello, world");
char arr[10];
 
is >> std::setw(6) >> arr;
std::cout << "Input from \"" << is.str() << "\" with setw(6) gave \""
<< arr << "\"\n";
}

Output:

no setw: [42]
setw(6): [ 42]
no setw, several elements: [891234]
setw(6), several elements: [89 1234]
Input from "hello, world" with setw(6) gave "hello"
