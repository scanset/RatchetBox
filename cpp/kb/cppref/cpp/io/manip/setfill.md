Defined in header <iomanip>

template< class CharT >

/*unspecified*/ setfill( CharT c );

When used in an expression out << setfill(c) sets the fill character of the stream out to c.

### Parameters

c

-

new value for the fill character

### Return value

An object of unspecified type such that

- if out is an object of type std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>, the expression out << setfill(c)
has type std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&

- has value out

- behaves as if it called f(out, c)

where the function f is defined as:

template<class CharT, class Traits>
void f(std::basic_ios<CharT, Traits>& str, CharT c)
{
// set fill character
str.fill(c);
}

### Notes

The current fill character may be obtained with std::ostream::fill.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::cout << "default fill: [" << std::setw(10) << 42 << "]\n"
<< "setfill('*'): [" << std::setfill('*')
<< std::setw(10) << 42 << "]\n";
}

Output:

default fill: [ 42]
setfill('*'): [********42]
