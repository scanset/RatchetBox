void clear( std::ios_base::iostate state = std::ios_base::goodbit );

Sets the stream error state flags by assigning them the value of state. By default, assigns std::ios_base::goodbit which has the effect of clearing all error state flags.

If rdbuf() is a null pointer (i.e. there is no associated stream buffer), then state | std::ios_base::badbit is assigned.

### Parameters

state

-

new error state flags setting. It can be a combination of the following constants:

Constant

Explanation

goodbit

no error

badbit

irrecoverable stream error

failbit

input/output operation failed (formatting or extraction error)

eofbit

associated input sequence has reached end-of-file

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

If the new error state includes a bit that is also included in the exceptions() mask, throws an exception of type failure.

### Example

clear() without arguments can be used to unset the failbit after unexpected input; for std::cin.putback(c) see ungetc.

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
for (char c : {'\n', '4', '1', '.', '3', '\n', 'Z', 'Y', 'X'})
std::cin.putback(c); // emulate user's input (not portable: see ungetc Notes)
 
double n;
while (std::cout << "Please, enter a number: " && !(std::cin >> n))
{
std::cin.clear();
std::string line;
std::getline(std::cin, line);
std::cout << line << "\nI am sorry, but '" << line << "' is not a number\n";
}
std::cout << n << "\nThank you for entering the number " << n << '\n';
}

Output:

Please, enter a number: XYZ
I am sorry, but 'XYZ' is not a number
Please, enter a number: 3.14
Thank you for entering the number 3.14
