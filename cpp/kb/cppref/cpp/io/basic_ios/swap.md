protected:

void swap( basic_ios& other ) noexcept;

(since C++11)

Exchanges the states of *this and other, except for the associated rdbuf objects. rdbuf() and other.rdbuf() returns the same values as before the call.

This swap function is protected: it is called by the swap member functions of the derived stream classes such as std::basic_ofstream or std::basic_istringstream, which know how to correctly swap the associated stream buffers.
