pos_type pubseekoff( off_type off, std::ios_base::seekdir dir,

                     std::ios_base::openmode which = ios_base::in | ios_base::out );

(1)

protected:

virtual pos_type seekoff( off_type off, std::ios_base::seekdir dir,

std::ios_base::openmode which = ios_base::in | ios_base::out );

(2)

Sets the position indicator of the input and/or output sequence relative to some other position.

1) Calls seekoff(off, dir, which) of the most derived class.

2) The base class version of this function has no effect. The derived classes may override this function to allow relative positioning of the position indicator.

### Parameters

off

-

relative position to set the position indicator to.

dir

-

defines base position to apply the relative offset to. It can be one of the following constants:

Constant

Explanation

beg

the beginning of a stream

end

the ending of a stream

cur

the current position of stream position indicator

which

-

defines which of the input and/or output sequences to affect. It can be one or a combination of the following constants:

Constant

Explanation

in

affect the input sequence

out

affect the output sequence

### Note

Not all combinations of parameters may be valid, see the derived versions of seekoff for details.

### Return value

1) The return value of seekoff(off, dir, which)

2) The resulting absolute position as defined by the position indicator. The base class version returns pos_type(off_type(-1)).
