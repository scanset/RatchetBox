Constructs new std::istrstream and its underlying std::strstreambuf.

1,2) Constructs the underlying std::strstreambuf by calling strstreambuf(s, 0) and initializes the base class with the address of the strstreambuf. The behavior is undefined if s is not pointing at an element of a null-terminated array.

3,4) Constructs the underlying std::strstreambuf by calling strstreambuf(s, n) and initializes the base class with the address of the strstreambuf. The behavior is undefined if s is not pointing at an element of an array whose length is at least n elements.

### Parameters

s

-

C-string or char array to use as the contents of the stream

n

-

size of the array

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <strstream>
 
int main()
{
std::istrstream s1("1 2 3"); // string literal
int n1, n2, n3;
if (s1 >> n1 >> n2 >> n3)
std::cout << n1 << ", " << n2 << ", " << n3 << '\n';
 
char arr[] = {'4', ' ', '5', ' ', '6'};
std::istrstream s2(arr, sizeof arr);
if (s2 >> n1 >> n2 >> n3)
std::cout << n1 << ", " << n2 << ", " << n3 << '\n';
}

Output:

1, 2, 3
4, 5, 6
