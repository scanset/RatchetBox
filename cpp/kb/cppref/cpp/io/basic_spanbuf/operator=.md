basic_spanbuf& operator=( basic_spanbuf&& rhs );

(1)
(since C++23)

basic_spanbuf& operator( const basic_spanbuf& ) = delete;

(2)
(since C++23)

1) Move assignment operator. Equivalent to auto tmp{std::move(rhs)}; this->swap(tmp); return *this;. After move assignment, *this holds the state rhs held before move assignment. It is implementation-defined whether rhs still hold the underlying buffer after move assignment.

2) The copy assignment operator is deleted; basic_spanbuf is not CopyAssignable.
