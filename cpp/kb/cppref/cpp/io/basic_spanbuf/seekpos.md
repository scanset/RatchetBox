protected:

pos_type seekpos( pos_type sp, std::ios_base::openmode which =

std::ios_base::in | std::ios_base::out ) override;

(since C++23)

Repositions the next pointer to the get and/or put area, if possible, to the position indicated by sp.

Equivalent to return seekoff(off_type(sp), std::ios_base::beg, which);.

### Parameters

sp

-

stream position, such as one obtained by seekoff() or seekpos()

which

-

defines whether the input sequences, the output sequence, or both are affected. It can be one or a combination of the following constants:

Constant

Explanation

in

affect the input sequence

out

affect the output sequence

### Return value

sp on success or pos_type(off_type(-1)) on failure.

### Notes

seekpos() is called by std::basic_streambuf::pubseekpos(), which is called by the single-argument versions of std::basic_istream::seekg() and std::basic_ostream::seekp().
