bool is_open() const;

Returns true if the most recent call to open() succeeded and there has been no call to close() since then.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if the associated file is open, false otherwise.

### Notes

This function is typically called by std::basic_fstream::is_open().

### Example

Run this code

#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::ifstream fs("test.txt");
std::filebuf fb;
fb.open("test.txt", std::ios_base::in);
std::cout << std::boolalpha
<< "direct call: " << fb.is_open() << '\n'
<< "through streambuf: " << fs.rdbuf()->is_open() << '\n'
<< "through fstream: " << fs.is_open() << '\n';
}

Output:

direct call: true
through streambuf: true
through fstream: true
