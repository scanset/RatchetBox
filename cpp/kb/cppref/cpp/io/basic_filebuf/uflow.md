virtual int_type uflow()

Behaves like the underflow(), except that if underflow() succeeds (does not return Traits::eof()), then advances the next pointer for the get area. In other words, consumes one of the characters obtained by underflow().

### Parameters

### Return value

The value of the character that was read and consumed in case of success, or Traits::eof() in case of failure.
