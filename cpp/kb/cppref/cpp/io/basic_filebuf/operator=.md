std::basic_filebuf& operator=( std::basic_filebuf&& rhs );

(1)
(since C++11)

std::basic_filebuf& operator=( const std::basic_filebuf& rhs ) = delete;

(2)

Assigns another basic_filebuf object.

1) First calls close() to close the associated file, then moves the contents of rhs into *this: the put and get buffers, the associated file, the locale, the openmode, the is_open flag, and any other state. After the move, rhs is not associated with a file and rhs.is_open() == false.

2) The copy assignment operator is deleted; basic_filebuf is not CopyAssignable.

### Parameters

rhs

-

another basic_filebuf that will be moved from

### Return value

*this

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::ofstream{"test.in"} << "test\n"; // writes via a temporary object
std::ifstream fin("test.in"); // read-only stream
std::ofstream fout("test.out"); // write-only stream
 
std::string s;
std::getline(fin, s);
std::cout << "s = [" << s << "]\n"; // s contains "test"
 
assert(fout.is_open());
*fin.rdbuf() = std::move(*fout.rdbuf());
assert(!fout.is_open());
 
std::getline(fin, s);
std::cout << "s = [" << s << "]\n"; // s is empty input
}

Output:

s = [test]
s = []
