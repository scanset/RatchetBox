Defined in header <ios>

std::error_condition make_error_condition( std::io_errc e ) noexcept;

(since C++11)

Constructs an std::error_condition object from a value of type std::io_errc as if by return std::error_condition(static_cast<int>(e), std::iostream_category()).

### Parameters

e

-

error code number

### Return value

A value of type std::error_condition that holds the error code number from e associated with the error category "iostream".

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <system_error>
 
int main()
{
std::error_condition ec = std::make_error_condition(std::io_errc::stream);
std::cout << "error condition for io_errc::stream has value " << ec.value()
<< "\nand message \"" << ec.message() << "\"\n";
}

Output:

error condition for io_errc::stream has value 1
and message "unspecified iostream_category error"
