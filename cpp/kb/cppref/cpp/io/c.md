The C I/O subset of the C++ standard library implements C-style stream input/output operations. The <cstdio> header provides generic file operation support and supplies functions with narrow and multibyte character input/output capabilities, and the <cwchar> header provides functions with wide character input/output capabilities. 

C streams are denoted by objects of type std::FILE that can only be accessed and manipulated through pointers of type std::FILE*. Each C stream is associated with an external physical device (file, standard input stream, printer, serial port, etc).

### Types

Defined in header <cstdio> 

FILE

object type, capable of holding all information needed to control a C I/O stream 
(typedef)

fpos_t

complete non-array object type, capable of uniquely specifying a position in a file, including its multibyte parse state 
(typedef)

### Predefined standard streams

Defined in header <cstdio> 

stdinstdoutstderr

expression of type FILE* associated with the input stream
expression of type FILE* associated with the output stream
expression of type FILE* associated with the error output stream 
(macro constant)
