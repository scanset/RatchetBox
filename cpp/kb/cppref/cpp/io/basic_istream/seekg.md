basic_istream& seekg( pos_type pos );

(1)

basic_istream& seekg( off_type off, std::ios_base::seekdir dir );

(2)

Sets input position indicator of the current associated streambuf object.

Before doing anything else, seekg clears eofbit.
(since C++11)

seekg behaves as UnformattedInputFunction, except that gcount() is not affected. After constructing and checking the sentry object,

1) if fail() != true, sets the input position indicator to absolute (relative to the beginning of the file) value pos. Specifically, executes rdbuf()->pubseekpos(pos, std::ios_base::in) (pubseekpos, in turn, calls seekpos of the specific buffer, such as basic_filebuf::seekpos, basic_stringbuf::seekpos, or strstreambuf::seekpos). In case of failure, calls setstate(std::ios_base::failbit).

2) if fail() != true, sets the input position indicator to position off, relative to position, defined by dir. Specifically, executes rdbuf()->pubseekoff(off, dir, std::ios_base::in). In case of failure, calls setstate(std::ios_base::failbit).

### Parameters

pos

-

absolute position to set the input position indicator to

off

-

relative position (positive or negative) to set the input position indicator to

dir

-

defines base position to apply the relative offset to. It can be one of the following constants:

Constant

Explanation

beg

the beginning of a stream

end

the ending of a stream

cur

the current position of stream position indicator

### Return value

*this

### Exceptions

failure if an error occurred (the error state flag is not goodbit) and exceptions() is set to throw for that state.
If an internal operation throws an exception, it is caught and badbit is set. If exceptions() is set for badbit, the exception is rethrown.

### Notes

seekg(n) is not necessarily equivalent to seekg(n, ios::beg). std::basic_ifstream, for example, requires the absolute position n to come from tellg().

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::string str = "Hello, world";
std::istringstream in(str);
std::string word1, word2;
 
in >> word1;
in.seekg(0); // rewind
in >> word2;
 
std::cout << "word1 = " << word1 << '\n'
<< "word2 = " << word2 << '\n';
}

Output:

word1 = Hello,
word2 = Hello,
