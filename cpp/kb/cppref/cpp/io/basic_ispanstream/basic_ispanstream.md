explicit basic_ispanstream( ROS&& r );

(since C++23)

basic_ispanstream( basic_ispanstream&& rhs );

basic_ispanstream( const basic_ispanstream& ) = delete;

(4)
(since C++23)

Constructs a new basic_ispanstream.

1) Uses the storage referenced by s as initial underlying buffer of the wrapped std::basic_spanbuf device. The wrapped std::basic_spanbuf object is constructed as basic_spanbuf<Char, Traits>(s, mode | std::ios_base::in).

2) Uses the storage referenced by r after converted to std::span<const CharT> as initial underlying buffer of the wrapped std::basic_spanbuf device. The wrapped std::basic_spanbuf object is opened in mode std::ios_base::in. This overload participates in overload resolution only if ROS models borrowed_range, std::convertible_to<ROS, std::span<CharT>> is false, and std::convertible_to<ROS, std::span<const CharT>> is true.

3) Move constructor. Move constructs the std::basic_istream base subobject and the wrapped std::basic_spanbuf from those of rhs, and then calls set_rdbuf with the address of the wrapped std::basic_spanbuf in *this to install it.

4) Copy constructor is deleted. basic_ispanstream is not copyable.

### Parameters

s

-

std::span referencing the storage to be use as initial underlying buffer of stream

r

-

borrowed_range to be use as initial underlying buffer of stream

mode

-

specifies stream open mode. Following constants and bit-wise OR between them may be used:

Constant

Explanation

app

seek to the end of stream before each write

binary

open in binary mode

in

open for reading

out

open for writing

trunc

discard the contents of the stream when opening

ate

seek to the end of stream immediately after open

noreplace (C++23)

open in exclusive mode

other

-

another basic_ispanstream to be moved from
