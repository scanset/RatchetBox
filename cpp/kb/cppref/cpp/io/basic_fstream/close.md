void close();

Closes the associated file.

Effectively calls rdbuf()->close(). If an error occurs during operation, setstate(failbit) is called. 

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

(none)

### Notes

This function is called by the destructor of basic_fstream when the stream object goes out of scope and is not usually invoked directly.

### Example

Run this code

#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::fstream f1("example1", std::ios::out),
f2("example2", std::ios::out),
f3("example3", std::ios::out);
 
std::cout << std::boolalpha
<< f1.is_open() << '\n'
<< f2.is_open() << '\n'
<< f3.is_open() << '\n';
 
f1.close();
f2.close();
 
std::cout << f1.is_open() << '\n'
<< f2.is_open() << '\n'
<< f3.is_open() << '\n';
}

Possible output:

true
true
true
false
false
true
