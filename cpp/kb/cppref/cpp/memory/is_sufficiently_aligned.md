Defined in header <memory>

template< std::size_t N, class T >

bool is_sufficiently_aligned( T* ptr );

(since C++26)

Checks whether the pointer ptr points to an object whose alignment has a value of at least N.

The behavior is undefined if ptr does not point to an object of type T (ignoring cv-qualification at every level).

### Return value

true if ptr points to an object that has alignment at least N; otherwise false.

### Exceptions

Throws nothing.

### Notes

std::is_sufficiently_aligned can be used as a precondition to std::assume_aligned.
