template< class NoThrowForwardIt, class T >

void uninitialized_fill( NoThrowForwardIt first,

NoThrowForwardIt last, const T& value );

(1)
(constexpr since C++26)

template< class ExecutionPolicy, class NoThrowForwardIt, class T >

void uninitialized_fill( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,

                         NoThrowForwardIt first,

NoThrowForwardIt last, const T& value );

(2)
(since C++17)

1) Copies value to an uninitialized memory area [first, last) as if by

for (; first != last; ++first)

    ::new (voidify(*first))

        typename std::iterator_traits<NoThrowForwardIt>::value_type(value);

If an exception is thrown during the initialization, the objects already constructed are destroyed in an unspecified order.

2) Same as (1), but executed according to policy.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.

(until C++20)

std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.

(since C++20)

### Parameters

first, last

-

the range of the elements to initialize

value

-

the value to construct the elements with

policy

-

the execution policy to use

Type requirements

-

NoThrowForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.

-

No increment, assignment, comparison, or indirection through valid instances of NoThrowForwardIt may throw exceptions. Applying &* to a NoThrowForwardIt value must yield a pointer to its value type.(until C++11)

### Complexity

Linear in the distance between first and last.

### Exceptions

The overload with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy reports errors as follows:

- If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.

- If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

### Possible implementation

template<class NoThrowForwardIt, class T>
constexpr void uninitialized_fill(NoThrowForwardIt first, NoThrowForwardIt last,
const T& value)
{
using V = typename std::iterator_traits<NoThrowForwardIt>::value_type;
NoThrowForwardIt current = first;
try
{
for (; current != last; ++current)
::new (static_cast<void*>(std::addressof(*current))) V(value);
} 
catch (...)
{
for (; first != current; ++first)
first->~V();
throw;
}
}

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
const std::size_t sz = 4;
std::allocator<std::string> alloc;
std::string* p = alloc.allocate(sz);
 
std::uninitialized_fill(p, p + sz, "Example");
 
for (std::string* i = p; i != p + sz; ++i)
{
std::cout << *i << '\n';
i->~basic_string<char>();
}
 
alloc.deallocate(p, sz);
}

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

LWG 866

C++98

given T as the value type of NoThrowForwardIt, if
T::operator new exists, the program might be ill-formed

uses global placement new instead

LWG 2433

C++11

this algorithm might be hijacked by overloaded operator&

uses std::addressof

LWG 3870

C++20

this algorithm might create objects on a const storage

kept disallowed
