The pointer_traits class template provides the standardized way to access certain properties of pointer-like types (fancy pointers, such as boost::interprocess::offset_ptr). The standard template std::allocator_traits relies on pointer_traits to determine the defaults for various typedefs required by Allocator.

1) The non-specialized pointer_traits conditionally declares the following members:

Let /*element-type-of*/<Ptr> be

- Ptr::element_type if present;

- otherwise, T if Ptr is a class template specialization Template<T, Args...>, where Args... is zero or more type arguments;

- otherwise, not defined.

If /*element-type-of*/<Ptr> is not defined, the primary template has no members specified in this page.

### Member types

Type

Definition

pointer

Ptr

element_type

/*element-type-of*/<Ptr>

difference_type

Ptr::difference_type if present, otherwise std::ptrdiff_t

### Member alias templates

Template

Definition

template< class U > using rebind

Ptr::rebind<U> if exists, otherwise Template<U, Args...> if Ptr is a template specialization Template<T, Args...>

### Member functions

pointer_to

[static]

obtains a dereferenceable pointer to its argument 
(public static member function)

2) A specialization is provided for pointer types, T*, which declares the following members:

### Member types

Type

Definition

pointer

T*

element_type

T

difference_type

std::ptrdiff_t

### Member alias templates

Template

Definition

template< class U > using rebind

U*

### Member functions

pointer_to

[static]

obtains a dereferenceable pointer to its argument 
(public static member function)

### Optional member functions of program-defined specializations

to_address

[static] (C++20)(optional)

obtains a raw pointer from a fancy pointer (inverse of pointer_to) 
(public static member function)

### Notes

The rebind member template alias makes it possible, given a pointer-like type that points to T, to obtain the same pointer-like type that points to U. For example,

using another_pointer = std::pointer_traits<std::shared_ptr<int>>::rebind<double>;
static_assert(std::is_same<another_pointer, std::shared_ptr<double>>::value);

A specialization for user-defined fancy pointer types may provide an additional static member function to_address to customize the behavior of std::to_address.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
template<class Ptr>
struct BlockList
{
// Predefine a memory block
struct block;
 
// Define a pointer to a memory block from the kind of pointer Ptr s
// If Ptr is any kind of T*, block_ptr_t is block*
// If Ptr is smart_ptr<T>, block_ptr_t is smart_ptr<block>
using block_ptr_t = typename std::pointer_traits<Ptr>::template rebind<block>;
 
struct block
{
std::size_t size{};
block_ptr_t next_block{};
};
 
block_ptr_t free_blocks;
};
 
int main()
{
[[maybe_unused]]
BlockList<int*> bl1;
// The type of bl1.free_blocks is BlockList<int*>:: block*
 
BlockList<std::shared_ptr<char>> bl2;
// The type of bl2.free_blocks is
// std::shared_ptr<BlockList<std::shared_ptr<char>>::block>
std::cout << bl2.free_blocks.use_count() << '\n';
}

Output:
