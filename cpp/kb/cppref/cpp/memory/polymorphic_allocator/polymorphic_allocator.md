polymorphic_allocator() noexcept;

(1)

polymorphic_allocator( const polymorphic_allocator& other ) = default;

(2)

template< class U > 

polymorphic_allocator( const polymorphic_allocator<U>& other ) noexcept;

(3)

polymorphic_allocator( std::pmr::memory_resource* r );

(4)

Constructs a new polymorphic_allocator.

1) Constructs a polymorphic_allocator using the return value of std::pmr::get_default_resource() as the underlying memory resource.

2,3) Constructs a polymorphic_allocator using other.resource() as the underlying memory resource.

4) Constructs a polymorphic_allocator using r as the underlying memory resource. This constructor provides an implicit conversion from std::pmr::memory_resource*.

### Parameters

other

-

another polymorphic_allocator to copy from

r

-

pointer to the memory resource to use. May not be null

### Exceptions

4) Throws nothing.

### Notes 

Copying a container using a polymorphic_allocator will not call the allocator's copy constructor. Instead, the new container will use the return value of select_on_container_copy_construction (a default-constructed polymorphic_allocator) as its allocator.
