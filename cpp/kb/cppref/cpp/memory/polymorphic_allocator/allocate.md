T* allocate( std::size_t n );

(since C++17)

Allocates storage for n objects of type T using the underlying memory resource. Equivalent to return static_cast<T*>(resource()->allocate(n * sizeof(T), alignof(T)));.

### Parameters

n

-

the number of objects to allocate storage for

### Return value

A pointer to the allocated storage.

### Exceptions

Throws std::bad_array_new_length if n > std::numeric_limits<std::size_t>::max() / sizeof(T); may also throw any exceptions thrown by the call to resource()->allocate.
