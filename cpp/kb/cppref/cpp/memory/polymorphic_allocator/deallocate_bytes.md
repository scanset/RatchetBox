void deallocate_bytes( void* p,

                       std::size_t nbytes,

std::size_t alignment = alignof(std::max_align_t) );

(since C++20)

Deallocates the storage pointed to by p, which must have been allocated from a std::pmr::memory_resource x that compares equal to *resource(), using x.allocate(nbytes, alignment), typically through a call to allocate_bytes(nbytes, alignment).

Equivalent to resource()->deallocate(p, nbytes, alignment);.

### Parameters

p

-

pointer to memory to deallocate

nbytes

-

the number of bytes originally allocated

alignment

-

the alignment originally allocated

### Exceptions

Throws nothing.

### Notes

This function was introduced for use with the fully-specialized allocator std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<>, but it may be useful in any specialization.
