template< class U >

U* allocate_object( std::size_t n = 1 );

(since C++20)

Allocates storage for n objects of type U using the underlying memory resource. 

If std::numeric_limits<std::size_t>::max() / sizeof(U) < n, throws std::bad_array_new_length, otherwise equivalent to return static_cast<U*>(allocate_bytes(n * sizeof(U), alignof(U)));.

### Parameters

n

-

the number of objects to allocate storage for

### Return value

A pointer to the allocated storage. 

### Notes

This function was introduced for use with the fully-specialized allocator std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<>, but it may be useful in any specialization as a shortcut to avoid having to rebind from std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<T> to std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<U>.

Since U is not deduced, it must be provided as a template argument when calling this function.

### Exceptions

Throws std::bad_array_new_length if n > std::numeric_limits<std::size_t>::max() / sizeof(U); may also be any exceptions thrown by the call to resource()->allocate.
