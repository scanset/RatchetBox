Defined in header <memory>

(1)

template< class ForwardIt, class Size >

ForwardIt destroy_n( ForwardIt first, Size n );

(since C++17) 
(until C++20)

template< class ForwardIt, class Size >

constexpr ForwardIt destroy_n( ForwardIt first, Size n );

(since C++20)

template< class ExecutionPolicy, class ForwardIt, class Size >

ForwardIt destroy_n( ExecutionPolicy&& policy, ForwardIt first, Size n );

(2)
(since C++17)

1) Destroys the n objects in the range starting at first, as if by
for (; n > 0; (void) ++first, --n)
std::destroy_at(std::addressof(*first));

2) Same as (1), but executed according to policy. This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.

(until C++20)

std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.

(since C++20)

### Parameters

first

-

the beginning of the range of elements to destroy

n

-

the number of elements to destroy

policy

-

the execution policy to use

Type requirements

-

ForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.

-

No increment, assignment, comparison, or indirection through valid instances of ForwardIt may throw exceptions.

### Return value

The end of the range of objects that has been destroyed (i.e., std::next(first, n)).

### Complexity

Linear in n.

### Exceptions

The overload with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy reports errors as follows:

- If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.

- If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

### Possible implementation

template<class ForwardIt, class Size>
constexpr // since C++20
ForwardIt destroy_n(ForwardIt first, Size n)
{
for (; n > 0; (void) ++first, --n)
std::destroy_at(std::addressof(*first));
return first;
}

### Example

The following example demonstrates how to use destroy_n to destroy a contiguous sequence of elements.

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <new>
 
struct Tracer
{
int value;
~Tracer() { std::cout << value << " destructed\n"; }
};
 
int main()
{
alignas(Tracer) unsigned char buffer[sizeof(Tracer) * 8];
 
for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i)
new(buffer + sizeof(Tracer) * i) Tracer{i}; //manually construct objects
 
auto ptr = std::launder(reinterpret_cast<Tracer*>(buffer));
 
std::destroy_n(ptr, 8);
}

Output:

0 destructed
1 destructed
2 destructed
3 destructed
4 destructed
5 destructed
6 destructed
7 destructed
