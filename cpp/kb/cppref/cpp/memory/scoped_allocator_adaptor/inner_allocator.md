Obtains a reference to the inner allocator used to declare this scoped_allocator_adaptor.

If sizeof...(InnerAllocs) == 0, that is, no inner allocators were declared, returns *this. Otherwise returns a reference to std::scoped_allocator_adaptor<InnerAllocs...>, that is, a scoped allocator composed of all inner allocators of *this, with the first inner allocator becoming the outer allocator.

### Parameters

A reference to the inner allocator, which is itself a std::scoped_allocator_adaptor.
