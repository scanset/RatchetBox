Defined in header <memory>

template< class Pointer, class SizeType = std::size_t >

struct allocation_result;

(since C++23)

allocation_result specializations are returned from the allocate_at_least member function of appropriate Allocator types (e.g. std::allocator::allocate_at_least) and std::allocator_traits::allocate_at_least.

Every specialization of allocation_result has no base classes or declared members other than ptr and count, thus it is suitable for aggregate initialization and structured binding.

### Template parameters

Pointer

-

typically std::allocator_traits<Alloc>::pointer, where Alloc is an Allocator type

SizeType

-

typically std::allocator_traits<Alloc>::size_type, where Alloc is an Allocator type

### Data members

Member name

Definition

ptr

a pointer of type Pointer which is typically used for the address of the first element in the storage allocated by allocate_at_least 
(public member object)

count

a value of type SizeType which is typically used for the actual number of elements in the storage allocated by allocate_at_least 
(public member object)

### Notes

Pointer and SizeType are a pointer to an object type and std::make_unsigned_t<std::ptrdiff_t> (which is almost always same as std::size_t) by default.
