1-4) Implicitly creates a complete object of type T (whose address is p) and objects nested within it. The value of each created object obj of TriviallyCopyable type U is determined in the same manner as for a call to std::bit_cast<U>(E) except that the storage is not actually accessed, where E is the lvalue of type U denoting obj. Otherwise, the values of such created objects are unspecified.

- T shall be an ImplicitLifetimeType and shall be a complete type. Otherwise, the program is ill-formed.

- The behavior is undefined if:

- [p, (char*)p + sizeof(T)) does not denote a region of allocated storage that is a subset of the region of storage reachable through p, or

- the region is not suitably aligned for the T.

- Note that the unspecified value can be indeterminate.

5-8) Implicitly creates an array with element type T and length n. To be precise, if n > 0 is true, it is equivalent to std::start_lifetime_as<U>(p) where U is the type "array of n Ts". Otherwise, the function has no effects.

- T shall be a complete type. Otherwise, the program is ill-formed.

- The behavior is undefined if:

- Non-null p is not suitably aligned for an array of T, or

- n <= std::size_t(-1) / sizeof(T) is false, or

- n > 0 and [(char*)p, (char*)p + (n * sizeof(T))) does not denote a region of allocated storage that is a subset of the region of storage reachable through p.

### Parameters

p

-

the address of the region consisting objects

n

-

the number of the element of the array to be created

### Return value

1-4) A pointer to the complete object as described above.

5-8) A pointer to the first element of the created array, if any; otherwise, a pointer that compares equal to p.

### Notes

new (void_ptr) unsigned char[size] or new (void_ptr) std::byte[size] works as an untyped version of std::start_lifetime_as, but it does not keep the object representation.

std::start_lifetime_as handles non-array types as well as arrays of known bound, while std::start_lifetime_as_array handles arrays of unknown bound.

Explicit lifetime management

### Example

Run this code

#include <complex>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
int main()
{
alignas(std::complex<float>) unsigned char network_data[sizeof(std::complex<float>)]
{
0xcd, 0xcc, 0xcc, 0x3d, 0xcd, 0xcc, 0x4c, 0x3e
};
 
// auto d = *reinterpret_cast<std::complex<float>*>(network_data);
// std::cout << d << '\n'; // UB: network_data does not point to a complex<float>
 
// auto d1 = *std::launder(reinterpret_cast<std::complex<float>*>(network_data));
// std::cout << d1 << '\n'; // UB: implicitly created objects have dynamic storage
// duration and have indeterminate value initially,
// even when an array which provides storage for
// them has determinate bytes.
// See also CWG2721.
 
auto d2 = *std::start_lifetime_as<std::complex<float>>(network_data);
std::cout << d2 << '\n'; // OK
}

Possible output:

(0.1,0.2)
