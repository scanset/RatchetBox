Defined in header <memory>

Call signature

template< no-throw-forward-range I, class T >

    requires std::constructible_from<std::iter_value_t<I>, const T&>

I uninitialized_fill_n( I first, std::iter_difference_t<I> count,

const T& value );

(since C++20) 
(constexpr since C++26)

Copies value to an uninitialized memory area first + [​0​, count) as if by
return ranges::uninitialized_fill(std::counted_iterator(first, count),
                                  std::default_sentinel, value).base();

If an exception is thrown during the initialization, the objects already constructed are destroyed in an unspecified order.

The function-like entities described on this page are algorithm function objects (informally known as niebloids), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.

- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.

- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

first

-

the beginning of the range of the elements to initialize

count

-

number of elements to construct

value

-

the value to construct the elements with

### Return value

As described above.

### Complexity

Linear in count.

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown on construction of the elements in the destination range.

### Notes

An implementation may improve the efficiency of the ranges::uninitialized_fill_n, e.g. by using ranges::fill_n, if the value type of the output range is TrivialType.

### Possible implementation

struct uninitialized_fill_n_fn
{
template<no-throw-forward-range I, class T>
requires std::constructible_from<std::iter_value_t<I>, const T&>
I operator()(I first, std::iter_difference_t<I> n, const T& x) const
{
I rollback{first};
try
{
for (; n-- > 0; ++first)
ranges::construct_at(std::addressof(*first), x);
return first;
}
catch (...) // rollback: destroy constructed elements
{
for (; rollback != first; ++rollback)
ranges::destroy_at(std::addressof(*rollback));
throw;
}
}
};
 
inline constexpr uninitialized_fill_n_fn uninitialized_fill_n{};

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
constexpr int n{3};
alignas(alignof(std::string)) char out[n * sizeof(std::string)];
 
try
{
auto first{reinterpret_cast<std::string*>(out)};
auto last = std::ranges::uninitialized_fill_n(first, n, "cppreference");
 
for (auto it{first}; it != last; ++it)
std::cout << *it << '\n';
 
std::ranges::destroy(first, last);
}
catch (...)
{
std::cout << "Exception!\n";
}
}

Output:
