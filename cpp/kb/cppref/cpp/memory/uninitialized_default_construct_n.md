( NoThrowForwardIt first, Size count );

(constexpr since C++26)

template< class ExecutionPolicy, class NoThrowForwardIt, class Size >

NoThrowForwardIt uninitialized_default_construct_n

( ExecutionPolicy&& policy, NoThrowForwardIt first, Size count );

(2)
(since C++17)

1) Constructs objects of type typename std::iterator_traits<NoThrowForwardIt>::value_type in the uninitialized memory area first + [​0​, count) by default-initialization, as if by

for (; count > 0; (void)++first, --count)

    ::new (voidify(*first))

        typename std::iterator_traits<NoThrowForwardIt>::value_type;

return first;

If an exception is thrown during the initialization, the objects already constructed are destroyed in an unspecified order.

2) Same as (1), but executed according to policy.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.

(until C++20)

std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.

(since C++20)

### Parameters

first

-

the beginning of the range of elements to initialize

count

-

the number of elements to construct

policy

-

the execution policy to use

Type requirements

-

NoThrowForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.

-

No increment, assignment, comparison, or indirection through valid instances of NoThrowForwardIt may throw exceptions.

### Return value

As described above.

### Complexity

Linear in n.

### Exceptions

The overload with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy reports errors as follows:

- If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.

- If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

### Possible implementation

template<class NoThrowForwardIt, class Size>
constexpr ForwardIt uninitialized_default_construct_n(NoThrowForwardIt first, Size count)
{
using T = typename std::iterator_traits<NoThrowForwardIt>::value_type;
NoThrowForwardIt current = first;
 
try
{
for (; countn > 0; (void) ++current, --count)
::new (static_cast<void*>(std::addressof(*current))) T;
return current;
}
catch (...)
{
std::destroy(first, current);
throw;
}
}

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
 
struct S
{
std::string m{"default value"};
};
 
int main()
{
constexpr int n{3};
alignas(alignof(S)) unsigned char mem[n * sizeof(S)];
 
try
{
auto first{reinterpret_cast<S*>(mem)};
auto last = std::uninitialized_default_construct_n(first, n);
 
for (auto it{first}; it != last; ++it)
std::cout << it->m << '\n';
 
std::destroy(first, last);
}
catch(...)
{
std::cout << "Exception!\n";
}
 
// For scalar types, uninitialized_default_construct_n
// generally does not zero-initialize the given uninitialized memory area.
int v[]{1, 2, 3, 4};
const int original[]{1, 2, 3, 4};
std::uninitialized_default_construct_n(std::begin(v), std::size(v));
 
// An attempt to access v might be an undefined behavior,
// pending CWG 1997 to be resolved:
// for (const int i : v)
// std::cout << i << ' ';
 
// The result is unspecified:
std::cout << (std::memcmp(v, original, sizeof(v)) == 0 ? "un" : "") << "modified\n";
}

Possible output:

default value
default value
default value
unmodified
