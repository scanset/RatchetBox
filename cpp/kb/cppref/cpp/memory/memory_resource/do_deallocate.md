virtual void do_deallocate( void* p, std::size_t bytes, std::size_t alignment ) = 0;

(since C++17)

Deallocates the storage pointed to by p.

p must have been returned by a prior call to allocate(bytes, alignment) on a memory_resource that compares equal to *this, and the storage it points to must not yet have been deallocated, otherwise the behavior is undefined.
