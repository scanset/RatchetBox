The std::allocator class template is the default Allocator used by all standard library containers if no user-specified allocator is provided. The default allocator is stateless, that is, all instances of the given allocator are interchangeable, compare equal and can deallocate memory allocated by any other instance of the same allocator type.

The explicit specialization for void lacks the member typedefs reference, const_reference, size_type and difference_type. This specialization declares no member functions.

(until C++20)

The default allocator satisfies allocator completeness requirements.

### Member functions

(constructor)

creates a new allocator instance 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destructs an allocator instance 
(public member function)

address

(until C++20)

obtains the address of an object, even if operator& is overloaded 
(public member function)

allocate

allocates uninitialized storage 
(public member function)

allocate_at_least

(C++23)

allocates uninitialized storage at least as large as requested size 
(public member function)

deallocate

deallocates storage 
(public member function)

max_size

(until C++20)

returns the largest supported allocation size 
(public member function)

construct

(until C++20)

constructs an object in allocated storage 
(public member function)

destroy

(until C++20)

destructs an object in allocated storage 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator!=

(removed in C++20)

compares two allocator instances 
(public member function)

### Notes

The member template class rebind provides a way to obtain an allocator for a different type. For example, std::list<T, A> allocates nodes of some internal type Node<T>, using the allocator A::rebind<Node<T>>::other(until C++11)std::allocator_traits<A>::rebind_alloc<Node<T>>, which is implemented in terms of A::rebind<Node<T>>::other if A is an std::allocator(since C++11).

Member type is_always_equal is deprecated via LWG issue 3170, because it makes custom allocators derived from std::allocator treated as always equal by default. std::allocator_traits<std::allocator<T>>::is_always_equal is not deprecated and its member constant value is true for any T.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
// default allocator for ints
std::allocator<int> alloc1;
 
// demonstrating the few directly usable members
static_assert(std::is_same_v<int, decltype(alloc1)::value_type>);
int* p1 = alloc1.allocate(1); // space for one int
alloc1.deallocate(p1, 1); // and it is gone
 
// Even those can be used through traits though, so no need
using traits_t1 = std::allocator_traits<decltype(alloc1)>; // The matching trait
p1 = traits_t1::allocate(alloc1, 1);
traits_t1::construct(alloc1, p1, 7); // construct the int
std::cout << *p1 << '\n';
traits_t1::deallocate(alloc1, p1, 1); // deallocate space for one int
 
// default allocator for strings
std::allocator<std::string> alloc2;
// matching traits
using traits_t2 = std::allocator_traits<decltype(alloc2)>;
 
// Rebinding the allocator using the trait for strings gets the same type
traits_t2::rebind_alloc<std::string> alloc_ = alloc2;
 
std::string* p2 = traits_t2::allocate(alloc2, 2); // space for 2 strings
 
traits_t2::construct(alloc2, p2, "foo");
traits_t2::construct(alloc2, p2 + 1, "bar");
 
std::cout << p2[0] << ' ' << p2[1] << '\n';
 
traits_t2::destroy(alloc2, p2 + 1);
traits_t2::destroy(alloc2, p2);
traits_t2::deallocate(alloc2, p2, 2);
}

Output:

7
foo bar
