### Member functions

operator()

(function)

## std::owner_less<void>::operator()

template< class T, class U >

bool operator()( const std::shared_ptr<T>& lhs,

const std::shared_ptr<U>& rhs ) const noexcept;

(since C++17)

template< class T, class U >

bool operator()( const std::shared_ptr<T>& lhs,

const std::weak_ptr<U>& rhs ) const noexcept;

(since C++17)

template< class T, class U >

bool operator()( const std::weak_ptr<T>& lhs,

const std::shared_ptr<U>& rhs ) const noexcept;

(since C++17)

template< class T, class U >

bool operator()( const std::weak_ptr<T>& lhs,

const std::weak_ptr<U>& rhs ) const noexcept;

(since C++17)

Compares lhs and rhs using owner-based semantics. Effectively calls lhs.owner_before(rhs).

The ordering is strict weak ordering relation.

lhs and rhs are equivalent only if they are both empty or share ownership.

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

shared-ownership pointers to compare

### Return value

true if lhs is less than rhs as determined by the owner-based ordering.
