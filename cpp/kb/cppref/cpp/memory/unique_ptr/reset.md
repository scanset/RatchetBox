members of the primary template, unique_ptr<T>

void reset( pointer ptr = pointer() ) noexcept;

(1)
(constexpr since C++23)

members of the specialization unique_ptr<T[]>

template< class U > 

void reset( U ptr ) noexcept;

(2)
(constexpr since C++23)

void reset( std::nullptr_t = nullptr ) noexcept;

(3)
(constexpr since C++23)

Replaces the managed object.

1,2) Equivalent to auto old_ptr = get();
/* assigns “ptr” to the stored pointer */
if (old_ptr)
    get_deleter()(old_ptr);.

If get_deleter()(old_ptr) throws an exception, the behavior is undefined.

2) This overload participates in overload resolution only if U is the same type as pointer, or all following conditions are satisfied:

- pointer is the same type as element_type*.

- U is a pointer type V* such that V(*)[] is convertible to element_type(*)[].

3) Equivalent to reset(pointer()).

### Parameters

ptr

-

pointer to a new object to manage

### Notes

To replace the managed object while supplying a new deleter as well, move assignment operator may be used.

A test for self-reset, i.e. whether ptr points to an object already managed by *this, is not performed, except where provided as a compiler extension or as a debugging assert. Note that code such as p.reset(p.release()) does not involve self-reset, only code like p.reset(p.get()) does. 

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
struct Foo // object to manage
{
Foo() { std::cout << "Foo...\n"; }
~Foo() { std::cout << "~Foo...\n"; }
};
 
struct D // deleter
{
void operator() (Foo* p)
{
std::cout << "Calling delete for Foo object... \n";
delete p;
}
};
 
int main()
{
std::cout << "Creating new Foo...\n";
std::unique_ptr<Foo, D> up(new Foo(), D()); // up owns the Foo pointer (deleter D)
 
std::cout << "Replace owned Foo with a new Foo...\n";
up.reset(new Foo()); // calls deleter for the old one
 
std::cout << "Release and delete the owned Foo...\n";
up.reset(nullptr); 
}

Output:

Creating new Foo...
Foo...
Replace owned Foo with a new Foo...
Foo...
Calling delete for Foo object...
~Foo...
Release and delete the owned Foo...
Calling delete for Foo object...
~Foo...
