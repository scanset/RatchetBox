typename std::add_lvalue_reference<T>::type operator*() const

    noexcept(noexcept(*std::declval<pointer>()));

(1)
(since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++23)

pointer operator->() const noexcept;

(2)
(since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++23)

operator* and operator-> provide access to the object owned by *this.

The behavior is undefined if get() == nullptr.

These member functions are only provided for unique_ptr for the single objects i.e. the primary template.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

1) Returns the object owned by *this, equivalent to *get().

2) Returns a pointer to the object owned by *this, i.e. get().

### Exceptions

1) May throw if pointer has a throwing operator*.

### Notes

The use of std::add_lvalue_reference is to make it possible to instantiate std::unique_ptr<void> since void& isn't allowed in C++ while std::add_lvalue_reference<void> produces void. See LWG673 for details.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
struct Foo
{
void bar() { std::cout << "Foo::bar\n"; }
};
 
void f(const Foo&) 
{
std::cout << "f(const Foo&)\n";
}
 
int main() 
{
std::unique_ptr<Foo> ptr(new Foo);
 
ptr->bar();
f(*ptr);
}

Output:

Foo::bar
f(const Foo&)
