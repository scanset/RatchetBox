Defined in header <memory>

template< class NoThrowForwardIt, class Size, class T >

NoThrowForwardIt uninitialized_fill_n( NoThrowForwardIt first,

Size count, const T& value );

(1)
(constexpr since C++26)

template< class ExecutionPolicy,

          class NoThrowForwardIt, class Size, class T >

NoThrowForwardIt uninitialized_fill_n( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,

                                       NoThrowForwardIt first,

Size count, const T& value );

(2)
(since C++17)

1) Copies value to an uninitialized memory area first + [​0​, count) as if by

for (; count--; ++first)

    ::new (voidify(*first))

        typename std::iterator_traits<NoThrowForwardIt>::value_type(value);

return first;

If an exception is thrown during the initialization, the objects already constructed are destroyed in an unspecified order.

2) Same as (1), but executed according to policy.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.

(until C++20)

std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.

(since C++20)

### Parameters

first

-

the beginning of the range of the elements to initialize

count

-

number of elements to construct

value

-

the value to construct the elements with

Type requirements

-

NoThrowForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.

-

No increment, assignment, comparison, or indirection through valid instances of NoThrowForwardIt may throw exceptions. Applying &* to a NoThrowForwardIt value must yield a pointer to its value type.(until C++11)

### Return value

As described above.

### Complexity

Linear in count.

### Exceptions

The overload with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy reports errors as follows:

- If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.

- If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

### Possible implementation

template<class NoThrowForwardIt, class Size, class T>
constexpr NoThrowForwardIt uninitialized_fill_n(NoThrowForwardIt first,
Size count, const T& value)
{
using V = typename std::iterator_traits<NoThrowForwardIt>::value_type;
NoThrowForwardIt current = first;
try
{
for (; count > 0; ++current, (void) --count)
::new (static_cast<void*>(std::addressof(*current))) V(value);
return current;
}
catch (...)
{
for (; first != current; ++first)
first->~V();
throw;
}
return current;
}

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
#include <tuple>
 
int main()
{
std::string* p;
std::size_t sz;
std::tie(p, sz) = std::get_temporary_buffer<std::string>(4);
std::uninitialized_fill_n(p, sz, "Example");
 
for (std::string* i = p; i != p + sz; ++i)
{
std::cout << *i << '\n';
i->~basic_string<char>();
}
std::return_temporary_buffer(p);
}
