static constexpr pointer

pointer_to( element_type& r ) noexcept;

(since C++20) 
(member of pointer_traits<T*> specialization)

Constructs a dereferenceable pointer or pointer-like object ("fancy pointer") to its argument.

1) The version of this function in the non-specialized std::pointer_traits template simply calls Ptr::pointer_to(r), and if Ptr does not provide a static member function pointer_to, instantiation of this function is a compile-time error.

2) The version of this function in the specialization of std::pointer_traits for pointer types returns std::addressof(r).

### Parameters

r

-

reference to an object of type element_type&, except if element_type is void, in which case the type of r is unspecified

### Return value

A dereferenceable pointer to r, of the type pointer_traits<>::pointer.

### Exceptions

1) Unspecified (typically same as Ptr::pointer_to).

### Notes

The Boost.Intrusive library version of this function returns pointer(std::addressof(r)) if Ptr::pointer_to does not exist.

### See also

addressof

(C++11)

obtains actual address of an object, even if the & operator is overloaded 
(function template)

address

(until C++20)

obtains the address of an object, even if operator& is overloaded 
(public member function of std::allocator<T>)

to_address

[static] (C++20)(optional)

obtains a raw pointer from a fancy pointer (inverse of pointer_to) 
(public static member function)

to_address

(C++20)

obtains a raw pointer from a pointer-like type 
(function template)
