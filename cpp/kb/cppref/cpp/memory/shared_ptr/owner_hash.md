std::size_t owner_hash() const noexcept;

(since C++26)

Returns an unspecified value such that for any object other where owner_equal(other) is true, owner_hash() == other.owner_hash() is true.

This hashing is used to make shared and weak pointers usable as keys in unordered associative containers, typically through std::owner_hash.

### Return value

A value that is identical for any std::shared_ptr or std::weak_ptr object sharing the same ownership.
