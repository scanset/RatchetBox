static pointer allocate( Alloc& a, size_type n, const_void_pointer hint );

(2)
(since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++20)

Uses the allocator a to allocate n * sizeof(Alloc::value_type) bytes of uninitialized storage. An array of type Alloc::value_type[n] is created in the storage, but none of its elements are constructed.

1) Calls a.allocate(n).

2) Additionally passes memory locality hint hint. Calls a.allocate(n, hint) if possible. If not possible (e.g. a has no two-argument member function allocate), calls a.allocate(n).

### Parameters

a

-

allocator to use

n

-

the number of objects to allocate storage for

hint

-

pointer to a nearby memory location

### Return value

The pointer returned by the call to a.allocate(n).

### Notes

Alloc::allocate was not required to create array object until P0593R6, which made using non-default allocator for std::vector and some other containers not well-defined according to a strict reading of the core language specification.

After calling allocate and before construction of elements, pointer arithmetic of Alloc::value_type* is well-defined within the allocated array, but the behavior is undefined if elements are accessed.
