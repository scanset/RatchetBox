A LegacyContiguousIterator is a LegacyIterator whose logically adjacent elements are also physically adjacent in memory.

A pointer to an element of an array satisfies all requirements of LegacyContiguousIterator.

### Requirements

The type It satisfies LegacyContiguousIterator if

- The type It satisfies LegacyIterator

And, for every

- a, a dereferenceable iterator of type It

- n, an integral value

such that 

- a + n is a valid and dereferenceable iterator value

then

- *(a + n) is equivalent to *(std::addressof(*a) + n).

### Standard library

The following standard library types are LegacyContiguousIterators.

- array::iterator.

- basic_string_view::iterator.

- basic_string::iterator.

- vector::iterator for value_type other than bool.

- The return type of begin(valarray) and end(valarray).

### Notes

Fancy pointer to object types are also required to satisfy LegacyContiguousIterator.

LegacyContiguousIterator is replaced with the contiguous_iterator concept: iterator types in the standard library that are required to satisfy LegacyContiguousIterator in C++17 are required to model contiguous_iterator in C++20.

(since C++20)
