A SeedSequence is an object that produces unsigned integer values i in the range 0 ≤ i < 232
based on a consumed range of integer data.

### Requirements

- S is a SeedSequence type.

- q is an object of S and r is a potentially constant object of S.

- T is the result_type.

- ib, ie are LegacyInputIterators with a value_type of unsigned integer values of at least 32 bits.

- il is a std::initializer_list<T>.

- rb, re are mutable LegacyRandomAccessIterators with a value_type of unsigned integer values of at least 32 bits.

- ob is a LegacyOutputIterator.

S()

Creates a seed sequence with the same initial state as other default-constructed seed sequences of type S.
Constant

S(ib, ie)

Creates a seed sequence with internal state depending on some or all supplied input bits by [ib, ie).
O(ie - ib)

S(il)

The same as S(il.begin(), il.end()).

q.generate(rb, re)
void
Fills [rb, re) with 32-bit quantities depending on the initial supplied values and potential previous calls to generate. If rb == re, it does nothing.
O(re - rb)

r.size()
size_t
The amount of 32-bit integers copied by param.
Constant

r.param(ob)
void
Copies 32-bit values to ob that would reproduce the current state of the object if passed to a constructor of S.
O(r.size())
