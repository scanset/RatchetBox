A LegacyRandomAccessIterator is a LegacyBidirectionalIterator that can be moved to point to any element in constant time.

If a LegacyRandomAccessIterator it originates from a Container, then it's value_type is the same as the container's, so dereferencing (*it) obtains the container's value_type.

A pointer to an element of an array satisfies all requirements of LegacyRandomAccessIterator.

### Requirements

The type It satisfies LegacyRandomAccessIterator if

- The type It satisfies LegacyBidirectionalIterator

And, given

- value_type, the type denoted by std::iterator_traits<It>::value_type

- difference_type, the type denoted by std::iterator_traits<It>::difference_type

- reference, the type denoted by std::iterator_traits<It>::reference

- i, a, b, objects of type It or const It

- r, an lvalue of type It

- n, an integer of type difference_type

The following expressions must be valid and have their specified effects:

Expression
Return type
Operational semantics
Notes

r += n

It&

difference_type m = n;

if (m >= 0) while (m--) ++r;

else while (m++) --r;

return r;

- n can be both positive or negative

- The complexity is constant (that is, the implementation cannot actually execute the while loop shown in operational semantics)

a + n
n + a

It

It temp = a;

return temp += n;

- n can be both positive or negative

- a + n == n + a

r -= n
It&
return r += -n;

The absolute value of n must be within the range of representable values of difference_type.

i - n
It
It temp = i;

return temp -= n;

b - a
difference_type
return n;
(see the precondition)

Precondition:

- there exists a value n of type difference_type such that a + n == b

Postcondition:

- b == a + (b - a).

i[n]
convertible to reference
*(i + n)

a < b

meets BooleanTestable

(until C++20)

models boolean-testable

(since C++20)

Equivalent to return b - a > 0;

Precondition:

- same as of b - a

Strict total ordering relation:

- !(a < a)

- if a < b then !(b < a)

- if a < b and b < c then a < c

- a < b or b < a or a == b
(exactly one of the expressions is true)

a > b

meets BooleanTestable

(until C++20)

models boolean-testable

(since C++20)

b < a

Total ordering relation opposite to a < b

a >= b

meets BooleanTestable

(until C++20)

models boolean-testable

(since C++20)

!(a < b)

a <= b

meets BooleanTestable

(until C++20)

models boolean-testable

(since C++20)

!(a > b)

The above rules imply that LegacyRandomAccessIterator also implements LessThanComparable.

A mutable LegacyRandomAccessIterator is a LegacyRandomAccessIterator that additionally satisfies the LegacyOutputIterator requirements.

### Concept

For the definition of std::iterator_traits, the following exposition-only concept is defined.

template<class I>

concept __LegacyRandomAccessIterator =

    __LegacyBidirectionalIterator<I> && std::totally_ordered<I> &&

        requires(I i, typename std::incrementable_traits<I>::difference_type n)

        {

            { i += n } -> std::same_as<I&>;

            { i -= n } -> std::same_as<I&>;

            { i +  n } -> std::same_as<I>;

            { n +  i } -> std::same_as<I>;

            { i -  n } -> std::same_as<I>;

            { i -  i } -> std::same_as<decltype(n)>;

            {  i[n]  } -> std::convertible_to<std::iter_reference_t<I>>;

};

where the exposition-only concept __LegacyBidirectionalIterator is described in LegacyBidirectionalIterator.

(since C++20)
