### Requirements

A UnformattedOutputFunction is a stream output function that performs the following:

1) Constructs an object of type basic_ostream::sentry with automatic storage duration, which performs the following:

- If eofbit or badbit are set on the output stream, sets the failbit as well, and if exceptions on failbit are enabled in this output stream's exception mask ((exceptions() & failbit) != 0), throws ios_base::failure.

- Flushes the tie()'d output stream, if applicable.

2) Checks the status of the sentry by calling sentry::operator bool(), which is equivalent to basic_ios::good.

- If the operator returns false or sentry's constructor throws an exception, no output takes place.

- If the operator returns true, attempts to perform the desired output by inserting the characters into the output stream as if by calling rdbuf()->sputc(). Other public members of std::basic_ostream may also be used, but virtual members of rdbuf() except overflow(), xsputn() and sync() will never be called.

- If an exception is thrown during output, sets badbit in the output stream. If exceptions on badbit are enabled in this stream's exception mask ((exceptions() & badbit) != 0), the exception is also rethrown.

- If no exception was thrown, returns the value specified by the function.

3) In any event, whether terminating by exception or returning, the sentry's destructor is called before leaving this function.

### Standard library

The following standard library functions are UnformattedOutputFunctions.

- basic_ostream::operator<<(basic_streambuf*)

- basic_ostream::put

- basic_ostream::write

- basic_ostream::flush

- basic_ostream::tellp (except calls pubseekoff instead of output)

- basic_ostream::seekp (except calls pubseekoff or pubseekpos instead of output)

(since C++11)
