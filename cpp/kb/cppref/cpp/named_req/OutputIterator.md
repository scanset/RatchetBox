A LegacyOutputIterator is a LegacyIterator that can write to the pointed-to element.

An example of a type that implements LegacyOutputIterator is std::ostream_iterator.

When LegacyForwardIterator, LegacyBidirectionalIterator, or LegacyRandomAccessIterator satisfies the LegacyOutputIterator requirements in addition to its own requirements, it is described as mutable.

### Requirements

The type X satisfies LegacyOutputIterator if

- The type X satisfies LegacyIterator

- X is a class type or a pointer type

And, given

- o, a value of some type that is writable to the output iterator (there may be multiple types that are writable, e.g. if operator= may be a template. There is no notion of value_type as for the input iterators)

- r, an lvalue of type X,

The following expressions must be valid and have their specified effects

Return

Pre-condition
Post-conditions
Notes

*r = o

(not used)

r is dereferenceable

r is incrementable

After this operation r is not required to be dereferenceable and any copies of the previous value of r are no longer required to be dereferenceable or incrementable.

++r

X&

r is incrementable

r and ++r designate the same iterator object, r is dereferenceable or past-the-end

After this operation r is not required to be incrementable and any copies of the previous value of r are no longer required to be dereferenceable or incrementable.

r++

convertible to const X&

X temp = r;

++r;

return temp;

*r++ = o

(not used)

*r = o;

++r;

### Notes

The only valid use of operator* with an output iterator is on the left of an assignment: operator* may return a proxy object, which defines a member operator= (which may be a template).

Equality and inequality may not be defined for output iterators. Even if an operator== is defined, x == y need not imply ++x == ++y.

Assignment through the same value of an output iterator happens only once: algorithms on output iterators must be single-pass algorithms.

Assignment through an output iterator is expected to alternate with incrementing. Double-increment is undefined behavior (C++ standard currently claims that double increment is supported, contrary to the STL documentation; this is LWG issue 2035).

Pure output-only iterator is allowed to declare its iterator_traits<X>::value_type, iterator_traits<X>::difference_type, iterator_traits<X>::pointer, and iterator_traits<X>::reference to be void (and iterators such as std::back_insert_iterator do just that except for difference_type, which is now defined to satisfy std::output_iterator(since C++20)).

### Standard library

The following standard library iterators are output iterators that are not forward iterators:

ostream_iterator

output iterator that writes to std::basic_ostream 
(class template)

ostreambuf_iterator

output iterator that writes to std::basic_streambuf 
(class template)

insert_iterator

iterator adaptor for insertion into a container 
(class template)

back_insert_iterator

iterator adaptor for insertion at the end of a container 
(class template)

front_insert_iterator

iterator adaptor for insertion at the front of a container 
(class template)

output_iterator

(C++20)

specifies that a type is an output iterator for a given value type, that is, values of that type can be written to it and it can be both pre- and post-incremented

Iterator library

provides definitions for iterators, iterator traits, adaptors, and utility functions
