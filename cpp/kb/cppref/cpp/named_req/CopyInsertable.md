Specifies that an object of the type can be copy-constructed in-place by a given allocator.

### Requirements

Given the following types, values and expressions:

Type

Definition

T

an object type

A

an allocator type

X

a container type satisfying all following conditions:

- X::value_type is the same as T.

- X::allocator_type is the same as std::allocator_traits<A>::rebind_alloc<T>.

Value

Definition

m

an lvalue of type A

p

a pointer of type T*

Expression

Definition

v

an expression denoting an lvalue of type T / const T, or an rvalue of type const T

expr

std::allocator_traits<A>::construct(m, p, v)

T is CopyInsertable into X if all following conditions are satisfied:

- T is MoveInsertable into X.

- expr is well-formed.

- Evaluating expr does not change the value of v.

- Right after the evaluation of expr, the value of v is equivalent to *p.

### Notes

If A is std::allocator<T>, then this will call placement new, as by ::new((void*)p) T(v)(until C++20)std::construct_at(p, v)(since C++20).

Although it is required that customized construct is used when constructing elements of std::basic_string until C++23, all implementations only used the default mechanism. The requirement is corrected by P1072R10 to match existing practice.
