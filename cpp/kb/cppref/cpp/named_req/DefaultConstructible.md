Specifies that an instance of the type can be default constructed.

### Requirements

The type T satisfies DefaultConstructible if all following statements and expressions are valid and have their specified effects:

Expression/Statement 

Postcondition

T u;

The object u is default-initialized.

T u{};

The object u is value-initialized or aggregate-initialized.

T()
T{}

A temporary object of type T is value-initialized or aggregate-initialized.

### Notes

For objects of non-aggregate class type, a public default constructor must be defined (either user-defined or implicitly defined) to satisfy DefaultConstructible.

Non-const objects of non-class object type are always DefaultConstructible.

Const non-class types are not DefaultConstructible.

Const aggregate types are not DefaultConstructible if any of their members is an object of non-class type.

Non-object types (function types, reference types, and the (possibly cv-qualified) type void) as well as the const non-object types are never DefaultConstructible.
