BinaryPredicate is a set of requirements expected by some of the standard library facilities from the user-provided arguments.

Given a BinaryPredicate bin_pred and a pair of iterators iter1 and iter2 or an iterator iter and a (possibly const) value value, the type and value category of the expression bin_pred(*iter1, *iter2) or, respectively, bin_pred(*iter, value), must meet the BooleanTestable requirements.

In addition, evaluation of that expression is not allowed to call non-const member functions of the dereferenced iterators; syntactically, the predicate must accept const object arguments, with the same behavior regardless of whether its arguments are const or non-const.

### Requirements

- Predicate

- CopyConstructible (unless otherwise specified)

### Standard library

The following standard library facilities expect a BinaryPredicate which isn't a Compare type.

unique

removes consecutive duplicate elements 
(public member function of std::forward_list<T,Allocator>)

unique

removes consecutive duplicate elements 
(public member function of std::list<T,Allocator>)

find_end

finds the last sequence of elements in a certain range 
(function template)

find_first_of

searches for any one of a set of elements 
(function template)

adjacent_find

finds the first two adjacent items that are equal (or satisfy a given predicate) 
(function template)

mismatch

finds the first position where two ranges differ 
(function template)

equal

determines if two sets of elements are the same 
(function template)

is_permutation

(C++11)

determines if a sequence is a permutation of another sequence 
(function template)

search

searches for the first occurrence of a range of elements 
(function template)

search_n

searches for the first occurrence of a number consecutive copies of an element in a range 
(function template)

unique

removes consecutive duplicate elements in a range 
(function template)

unique_copy

creates a copy of some range of elements that contains no consecutive duplicates 
(function template)

not2

(deprecated in C++17)(removed in C++20)

constructs custom std::binary_negate object 
(function template)

unordered_set

(C++11)

collection of unique keys, hashed by keys 
(class template)

unordered_map

(C++11)

collection of key-value pairs, hashed by keys, keys are unique 
(class template)

unordered_multiset

(C++11)

collection of keys, hashed by keys 
(class template)

unordered_multimap

(C++11)

collection of key-value pairs, hashed by keys 
(class template)
