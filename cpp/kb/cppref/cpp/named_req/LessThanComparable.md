The type must work with < operator and the result should have standard semantics.

### Requirements

The type T satisfies LessThanComparable if given expressions a, b and c of type T or const T(since C++11), the following expression is valid and has its specified effects:

a < b

meets BooleanTestable
(until C++20)

Establishes strict weak ordering relation with the following properties:

- For all a, !(a < a) yields true.

- If a < b, then !(b < a).

- If a < b and b < c, then a < c.

- Defining equiv(a, b) as !(a < b) && !(b < a), if equiv(a, b) and equiv(b, c), then equiv(a, c).

models boolean-testable
(since C++20)

### Notes

To satisfy this requirement, types that do not have built-in comparison operators have to provide a user-defined operator<.

For the types that are both EqualityComparable and LessThanComparable, the C++ standard library makes a distinction between

- Equality, which is the value of the expression a == b and

- Equivalence, which is the value of the expression !(a < b) && !(b < a).
