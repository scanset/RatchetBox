Specifies that an object of the type can be default-constructed in-place by a given allocator.

### Requirements

Given the following types, values and expressions:

Type

Definition

T

an object type

A

an allocator type

X

a container type satisfying all following conditions:

- X::value_type is the same as T.

- X::allocator_type is the same as std::allocator_traits<A>::rebind_alloc<T>.

Value

Definition

m

an lvalue of type A

p

a pointer of type T*

If the expression std::allocator_traits<A>::construct(m, p) is well-formed, T is DefaultInsertable into X.

### Notes

By default, this will value-initialize the object, as by ::new((void*)p) T()(until C++20)std::construct_at(p)(since C++20).

If value-initialization is undesirable, for example, if the object is of non-class type and zeroing out is not needed, it can be avoided by providing a custom Allocator::construct.

Although it is required that customized construct is used when constructing elements of std::basic_string until C++23, all implementations only used the default mechanism. The requirement is corrected by P1072R10 to match existing practice.
