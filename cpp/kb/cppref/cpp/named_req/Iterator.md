The LegacyIterator requirements describe types that can be used to identify and traverse the elements of a container.

LegacyIterator is the base set of requirements used by other iterator types: LegacyInputIterator, LegacyOutputIterator, LegacyForwardIterator, LegacyBidirectionalIterator, and LegacyRandomAccessIterator. Iterators can be thought of as an abstraction of pointers.

All the categories of iterators require only those functions that are realizable for a given category in constant time (amortized). Therefore, requirement tables and concept definitions(since C++20)for the iterators do not specify complexity.

### Requirements

The type It satisfies LegacyIterator if

- The type It satisfies CopyConstructible, and

- The type It satisfies CopyAssignable, and

- The type It satisfies Destructible, and

- The type It satisfies Swappable, and

- std::iterator_traits<It> has member typedefs value_type(until C++20), difference_type, reference, pointer, and iterator_category, and

- Given r, an lvalue of type It, the following expressions must be valid and have their specified effects:

Expression
Return Type
Precondition

*r

unspecified

r is dereferenceable

++r

It&

r is incrementable (the behavior of the expression ++r is defined)

### Concept

For the definition of std::iterator_traits, the following exposition-only concept is defined.

template<class I>

concept __LegacyIterator =

    requires(I i)

    {

        {   *i } -> __Referenceable;

        {  ++i } -> std::same_as<I&>;

        { *i++ } -> __Referenceable;

} && std::copyable<I>;

where the exposition-only concept __Referenceable<T> is satisfied if and only if T& is a valid type (in particular, T must not be void).

(since C++20)
