Specifies that the type is POD (Plain Old Data) type. This means the type is compatible with the types used in the C programming language, that is, can be exchanged with C libraries directly, in its binary form. 

Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name. This is a type category defined by the core language. It is included here as a named requirement only for consistency.

This type requirement is deprecated in the C++ standard. All of its uses have been replaced by the more refined type requirements, such as TrivialType, ScalarType, or StandardLayoutType.

(since C++20)

### Requirements

The following types are collectively called POD types:

- scalar types

- POD classes

- arrays of such types

- cv-qualified versions of these types
