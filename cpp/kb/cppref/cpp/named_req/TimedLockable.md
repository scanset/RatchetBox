The TimedLockable requirements describe the characteristics of types that provide timed exclusive blocking semantics for execution agents (threads, processes, tasks).

### Requirements

- Lockable

For type L to be TimedLockable, given

- rel_time, a value of a specialization of std::chrono::duration, and

- abs_time, a value of a specialization of std::chrono::time_point,

the following conditions have to be satisfied for an object m of type L:

Expression
Effects
Return value

m.try_lock_for(rel_time)

Blocks for the provided duration rel_time or until a lock on m is acquired.

true if the lock was acquired, false otherwise.

m.try_lock_until(abs_time)

Blocks until the provided time point abs_time is reached or a lock on m is acquired.

true if the lock was acquired, false otherwise.

### Notes

The try_lock_for and try_lock_until member functions obtain a non-shared lock on m on success.

### Standard library

The following standard library types satisfy TimedLockable:

timed_mutex

(C++11)

provides mutual exclusion facility which implements locking with a timeout 
(class)

recursive_timed_mutex

(C++11)

provides mutual exclusion facility which can be locked recursively
by the same thread and implements locking with a timeout 
(class)

shared_timed_mutex

(C++14)

provides shared mutual exclusion facility and implements locking with a timeout 
(class)
