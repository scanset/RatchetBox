A LegacyForwardIterator is a LegacyIterator that can read data from the pointed-to element.

Unlike LegacyInputIterator and LegacyOutputIterator, it can be used in multipass algorithms. 

If a LegacyForwardIterator it originates from a Container, then it's value type is the same as the container's, so dereferencing (*it) obtains the container's value type.

### Requirements

Type

Definition

X

A forward iterator type

T

The value type of X (i.e. std::iterator_traits<X>::value_type)

Ref

std::iterator_traits<X>::reference

Value

Definition

i, j

Values of type X or const X

r

A value of type X&

X satisfies LegacyForwardIterator if all following conditions are satisfied:

- X satisfies LegacyInputIterator.

- X satisfies DefaultConstructible.

- If X is a mutable iterator, Ref is a reference to T.

- If X is a constant iterator, Ref is a reference to const T.

- Objects of the type X provide multi-pass guarantee.

- If i and j are equal, then either i and j are both dereferenceable or else neither is dereferenceable.

- If i and j are both dereferenceable, then i == j if and only if *i and *j are bound to the same object.

- The following expressions must be valid and have their specified effects:

r++

++r;
return x;.

*i++

### Equality domain

The domain of == for forward iterators is that of iterators over the same underlying sequence.

However, value-initialized forward iterators can be compared, and must compare equal to other value-initialized iterators of the same type.

In other words, value-initialized forward iterators behave as if they refer past the end of the same empty sequence.

(since C++14)

### Multi-pass guarantee

Two dereferenceable iterators a and b of type X offer the multi-pass guarantee if all following conditions are satisfied:

- a == b implies ++a == ++b.

- Any of the following conditions is satisfied:

- X is a pointer type.

- The expression (void)++X(a), *a is equivalent to the expression *a.

### Concept

For the definition of std::iterator_traits, the following exposition-only concept is defined.

template<class It>

concept __LegacyForwardIterator =

    __LegacyInputIterator<It> && std::constructible_from<It> &&

    std::is_reference_v<std::iter_reference_t<It>> &&

    std::same_as<

        std::remove_cvref_t<std::iter_reference_t<It>>,

        typename std::indirectly_readable_traits<It>::value_type> &&

    requires(It it) {

        {  it++ } -> std::convertible_to<const It&>;

        { *it++ } -> std::same_as<std::iter_reference_t<It>>;

};

where the exposition-only concept __LegacyInputIterator<T> is described in LegacyInputIterator.

(since C++20)

### Notes

Unlike the std::forward_iterator concept, the LegacyForwardIterator requirements requires dereference to return a reference.

“a == b implies ++a == ++b” alone

__LegacyForwardIterator required
std::iter_reference_t<It> to be an lvalue reference type

also allows rvalue
reference types

- ↑ In the scenario where a and b use the same underlying iterator, evaluating the expression ++a == ++b actually increments the underlying container twice, but the result is still true.

- ↑ Formally also requires implying ++b != a.
