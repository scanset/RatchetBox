Specifies that a type is a literal type. Literal types are the types of constexpr variables and they can be constructed, manipulated, and returned from constexpr functions.

Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name. This is a type category defined by the core language. It is included here as a named requirement only for consistency.

### Requirements

A literal type is any of the following:

- possibly cv-qualified void (so that constexpr functions can return void);

(since C++14)

- scalar type;

- reference type;

- an array of literal type;

- possibly cv-qualified class type that has all of the following properties:

- has a trivial(until C++20)constexpr(since C++20) destructor,

- all of its non-static non-variant data members and base classes are of non-volatile literal types, and

- is one of

- a lambda type,

(since C++17)

- an aggregate union type that

- has no variant members, or

- has at least one variant member of non-volatile literal type,

- a non-union aggregate type, and each of its anonymous union members

- has no variant members, or

- has at least one variant member of non-volatile literal type,

- a type with at least one constexpr (possibly template) constructor that is not a copy or move constructor.

### Notes

A type can be literal even if all of its constexpr constructors are deleted, inaccessible, or cannot participate in overload resolution.

struct A { constexpr A(int) = delete; char c; }; // A is a literal type
constexpr A v = std::bit_cast<A>('0'); // OK in C++20
// v has literal type and thus can be constexpr

### Example

Literal type that extends string literals:

Run this code

#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
 
class conststr // conststr is a literal type
{
const char* p;
std::size_t sz;
public:
template<std::size_t N>
constexpr conststr(const char(&a)[N]) : p(a), sz(N - 1) {}
 
constexpr char operator[](std::size_t n) const
{
return n < sz ? p[n] : throw std::out_of_range("");
}
 
constexpr std::size_t size() const { return sz; }
};
 
constexpr std::size_t count_lower(conststr s)
{
std::size_t c{};
for (std::size_t n{}; n != s.size(); ++n)
if ('a' <= s[n] && s[n] <= 'z')
++c;
return c;
}
 
// An output function that requires a compile-time constant N, for testing
template<int N>
struct constN
{
constN() { std::cout << N << '\n'; }
};
 
int main()
{
std::cout << "The number of lowercase letters in \"Hello, world!\" is ";
constN<count_lower("Hello, world!")>(); // the string literal is implicitly
// converted to conststr
}

Output:

The number of lowercase letters in "Hello, world!" is 9
