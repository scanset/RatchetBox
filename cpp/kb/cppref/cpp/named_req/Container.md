A Container is an object used to store other objects and taking care of the management of the memory used by the objects it contains.

### Requirements

Given the following types and values:

Type

Definition

T

an object type

C

a container class containing objects of type T

Value

Definition

u, v

values of type C or const C

mv

a value of type C

cv

a value of type const C

lhs, rhs

lvalues of type C

i, j

values of type C::iterator or const C::iterator

C satisfies the requirements of Container if the following types, statements, and expressions are well-formed and have the specified semantics:

#### Types

Type

Definition

Requirements

typename C::value_type

T

T is CopyConstructible(until C++11)Erasable from C(since C++11).

typename C::reference

T&

No explicit requirement

typename C::const_reference

const T&

typename C::iterator

an iterator type

- C::iterator is a LegacyForwardIterator, and its value type is T.

- C::iterator is convertible to C::const_iterator.

typename C::const_iterator

a constant iterator type

C::const_iterator is a LegacyForwardIterator, and its value type is T.

typename C::difference_type

a signed integer type

C::difference_type is the same as the difference type of C::iterator and C::const_iterator.

typename C::size_type

an unsigned integer type

C::size_type is large enough to represent all non-negative values of C::difference_type.

#### Statements

Statement

Semantics

 Complexity 

C c;
C c = C();

Postcondition 

c.empty() is true.

constant

C c(v);
C c = C(v);

Precondition

If v is not an rvalue of type C, T is CopyInsertable into C.

(since C++11)

linear[1]

Postcondition

- If v is an lvalue, c == v is true.

- If v is an rvalue, and c and v do not refer to the same object(since C++11), c is equal to the value that v had before this construction.

Notes

- ↑ If v is an rvalue of type C, and C is not a specialization of std::array or std::inplace_vector, the complexity is constant.

#### Expressions

Postcondition

constant

C(v)

C

Precondition

If v is not an rvalue of type C, T is CopyInsertable into C.

(since C++11)

constant[1]

Postcondition

- If v is an lvalue, C(v) == v is true.

- If v is an rvalue, and C(v) and v do not refer to the same object(since C++11), C(v) is equal to the value that v had before this construction.

lhs = v

C&

Postcondition

- If v is an lvalue, lhs == v is true.

- If v is an rvalue, and lv and v do not refer to the same object(since C++11), lhs is equal to the value that v had before this assignment.

linear

v.~C()

void

Effect

Destroys all elements of v and deallocates all memory obtained.

linear

mv.begin()

C::iterator

Effect

Returns an iterator pointing to the first element of mv.

constant

cv.begin()

C::const_iterator

Effect

Returns an iterator pointing to the first element of cv.

constant

mv.end()

C::iterator

Effect

Returns the past-the-end iterator of mv.

constant

cv.end()

C::const_iterator

Effect

Returns the past-the-end iterator of cv.

constant

v.cbegin()
(since C++11)

C::const_iterator

Effect

Returns const_cast<const C&>(v).begin().

constant

v.cend()
(since C++11)

C::const_iterator

Effect

Returns const_cast<const C&>(v).end().

constant

i <=> j
(since C++20)

std::strong_ordering    

Constraint

This expression is only required to be well-formed if C::iterator satisfies the random access iterator requirements.

constant

u == v

bool

Effect

Returns 
u.size() == v.size() &&
    std::equal(u.begin(),
         u.end(), v.begin())
(until C++14)

std::equal(u.begin(), u.end(),
           v.begin(), v.end())
(since C++14)

.

linear[2]

u != v

Effect

Equivalent to !(u == v).

lhs.swap(rhs)
swap(lhs, rhs)

void

Effect

Exchanges the contents of lhs and rhs.

constant[3]

v.size()

C::size_type

Effect

Returns the number of elements[4] of v.

constant

v.max_size()

C::size_type

Effect

Returns the number of elements of the largest possible container of type C.

constant

v.empty()

bool

Effect

Returns v.begin() == v.end().

constant

Optional container requirements
(only provided for some types of containers)

u <=> v
(since C++20)

synth-three-way-result
    <C::value_type>

Precondition

Either T models three_way_comparable, or operator< is a total ordering relationship defined for values of type T and const T.

linear

Effect

Returns std::lexicographical_compare_three_way
    (u.begin(), u.end(),
     v.begin(), v.end(),
     synth-three-way ﻿)[5].

Notes

- ↑ If v is an rvalue of type C, and C is a specialization of std::array or std::inplace_vector, the complexity is linear.

- ↑ If u.size() != v.size() is true, the complexity is constant.

- ↑ If C is a specialization of std::array or std::inplace_vector, the complexity is linear.

- ↑ The number of elements is defined by the rules of constructors, inserts, and erases. It is equal to the value of std::distance(v.begin(), v.end()).

- ↑ If the iterators passed to std::lexicographical_compare_three_way are ConstexprIterators, the operation is implemented by constexpr functions.

In the expressions i == j, i != j, i < j, i <= j, i >= j, i > j and i - j, if i and/or j are replaced by iterators of type C::const_iterator pointing to the same element respectively, the semantics remain the same.
