Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name. This is a type category defined by the core language. It is included here as a named requirement only for consistency.

### Requirements

The following types are collectively called implicit-lifetime types:

- scalar types

- implicit-lifetime class types

- array types

- cv-qualified versions of these types

### Notes

Certain operations may implicitly create and start the lifetime of objects of implicit-lifetime types, if doing so would prevent undefined behavior. However, such operations do not start the lifetimes of subobjects of such objects that are not themselves of implicit-lifetime types.

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
