Defines a type that can be used to represent a set of constant values or any combination of those values. This trait is typically implemented by integer types, std::bitset, or enumerations (scoped and unscoped) with additional operator overloads.

### Requirements

The bitmask type supports a finite number of bitmask elements, which are distinct non-zero values of the bitmask type, such that, for any pair Ci and Cj, Ci & Ci is nonzero and Ci & Cj is zero. In addition, the value ​0​ is used to represent an empty bitmask, with no values set.

The bitwise operators operator&, operator|, operator^, operator~, operator&=, operator|=, and operator^= are defined for values of the bitmask type and have the same semantics as the corresponding built-in operators on unsigned integers would have if the bitmask elements were the distinct integer powers of two.

The following expressions are well-formed and have the following meaning for any BitmaskType:

X |= Y

sets the value Y in the object X

X &= ~Y

clears the value Y in the object X

X & Y

nonzero result indicates that the value Y is set in the object X

Each representable bitmask element is defined as an inline(since C++17) constexpr value of the bitmask type.

### Standard library

The following standard library types satisfy BitmaskType:

- std::chars_format

(since C++17)

- std::ctype_base::mask

- std::ios_base::fmtflags

- std::ios_base::iostate

- std::ios_base::openmode

- std::regex_traits::char_class_type

(since C++11)

- std::regex_constants::syntax_option_type

(since C++11)

- std::regex_constants::match_flag_type

(since C++11)

- std::launch

(since C++11)

- std::filesystem::perms

(since C++17)

- std::filesystem::perm_options

(since C++17)

- std::filesystem::copy_options

(since C++17)

- std::filesystem::directory_options

(since C++17)

Code that relies on some particular implementation option (e.g. int n = std::ios_base::hex) is non-portable because std::ios_base::fmtflags is not necessarily implicitly convertible to int.
