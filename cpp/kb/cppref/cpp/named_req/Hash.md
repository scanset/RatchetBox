A Hash is a function object for which the output depends only on the input and has a very low probability of yielding the same output given different input values.

### Requirements

The type T satisfies Hash if

- The type T satisfies FunctionObject, CopyConstructible, Destructible, and

Given

- h, a value of type T or const T, whose argument type is Key,

- k, a value of type convertible to Key or const Key,

- u, an lvalue expression of type Key.

The following expressions must be valid and have their specified effects.

Expression
Return type
Requirements

h(k)

std::size_t

The returned value depends only on the value of k for the duration of the program.
All evaluations of h(k) executed within a given execution of a program yield the same result for the same value of k.

The probability of h(a) == h(b) for a != b should approach 1.0 / std::numeric_limits<std::size_t>::max().

h(u)

std::size_t

u is not modified.
