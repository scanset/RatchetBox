A ConstexprIterator is a LegacyIterator that can be used during constant expression evaluation.

### Requirements

The type It satisfies ConstexprIterator if

- The type It satisfies some iterator requirements MeowIterator

And, for every 

- purr, an operation on It that is required to be supported by MeowIterator,

- kittens..., a set of arguments to purr that meets the requirements for that operation,

Then

- purr(kittens...) may be used in a constant expression if kittens... can also be used.

### Standard library

The following standard library types are ConstexprIterators.

- array::iterator and array::const_iterator.

- basic_string_view::iterator.

- span::iterator.

- vector::iterator and vector::const_iterator.

- optional::iterator and optional::const_iterator

(since C++26)
