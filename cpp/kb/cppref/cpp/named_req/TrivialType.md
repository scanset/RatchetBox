Specifies that a type is a trivial type.

Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name. This is a type category defined by the core language. It is included here as a named requirement only for consistency.

### Requirements

The following types are collectively called trivial types:

- scalar types

- trivial class types

- arrays of such types

- cv-qualified versions of these types

### Notes

A trivial class may have a private or protected trivial default constructor, in which case an attempt to default-construct such a class object in contexts unrelated to the class makes the program ill-formed.
