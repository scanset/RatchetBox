C++ includes a variety of utility libraries that provide functionality ranging from bit-counting to partial function application. These libraries can be broadly divided into two groups:

- language support libraries, and

- general-purpose libraries.

## Language support

Language support libraries provide classes and functions that interact closely with language features and support common language idioms.

### Type support

Basic types (e.g. std::size_t, std::nullptr_t), RTTI (e.g. std::type_info)

### Metaprogramming (since C++11)

Type traits (e.g. std::is_integral, std::rank), compile-time constants (e.g. std::integer_sequence, std::ratio)

### Constant evaluation context (since C++20)

Defined in header <type_traits> 

is_constant_evaluated

(C++20)

detects whether the call occurs within a constant-evaluated context 
(function)

is_within_lifetime

(C++26)

checks whether a pointer is within the object's lifetime at compile time 
(function)

### Implementation properties (since C++20)

The header <version> supplies implementation-dependent information about the C++ standard library (such as the version number and release date). It also defines the library feature-test macros.

### Program utilities

Termination (e.g. std::abort, std::atexit), environment (e.g. std::system), signals (e.g. std::raise)

### Dynamic memory management

Smart pointers (e.g. std::shared_ptr), allocators (e.g. std::allocator or std::pmr::memory_resource), C-style memory management (e.g. std::malloc)

### Error handling

Exceptions (e.g. std::exception, std::terminate), assertions (e.g. assert)

### Source code information capture (since C++20)

Defined in header <source_location>

Types for coroutine support, e.g. std::coroutine_traits, std::coroutine_handle.
