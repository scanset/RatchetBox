Notes

- Prefix versions of the built-in operators return references and postfix versions return values, and typical user-defined overloads follow the pattern so that the user-defined operators can be used in the same manner as the built-ins. However, in a user-defined operator overload, any type can be used as return type (including void).

- The int parameter is a dummy parameter used to differentiate between prefix and postfix versions of the operators. When the user-defined postfix operator is called, the value passed in that parameter is always zero, although it may be changed by calling the operator using function call notation (e.g., a.operator++(2) or operator++(a, 2)).

### Prefix operators

The prefix increment and decrement expressions have the form

++ expression

-- expression

1) prefix increment (pre-increment)

2) prefix decrement (pre-decrement)

#### Built-in prefix operators

1) The expression ++x is equivalent to x += 1, with the following exceptions:

- If the type of expression is (possibly volatile-qualified) bool, expression is set to true. Such a increment is deprecated.

(until C++17)

- If the type of expression is (possibly cv-qualified) bool, the program is ill-formed.

(since C++17)

- If the type of expression is volatile-qualified, the increment is deprecated.

(since C++20)

2) The expression --x is equivalent to x -= 1, with the following exceptions:

- If the type of expression is (possibly cv-qualified) bool, the program is ill-formed.

- If the type of expression is volatile-qualified, the decrement is deprecated.

(since C++20)

#### Overloads

In overload resolution against user-defined operators, for every optionally volatile-qualified arithmetic type A other than bool, and for every optionally volatile-qualified pointer P to optionally cv-qualified object type, the following function signatures participate in overload resolution:

A& operator++(A&)

bool& operator++(bool&)

(deprecated)(until C++17)

P& operator++(P&)

A& operator--(A&)

P& operator--(P&)

### Postfix operators

The postfix increment and decrement expressions have the form

expression ++

expression --

1) postfix increment (post-increment)

2) postfix decrement (post-decrement)

#### Built-in postfix operators

The result of postfix increment or decrement is the value obtained by applying the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion to expression (before modification). The type of the result is the cv-unqualified version of the type of expression.

If expression is not a modifiable lvalue of an arithmetic type other than (possibly cv-qualified) bool(since C++17), or a pointer to a complete object type, the program is ill-formed.

If the type of expression is volatile-qualified, the increment or decrement is deprecated.

(since C++20)

1) The value of expression is modified as if it were the operand of the prefix ++ operator.

2) The value of expression is modified as if it were the operand of the prefix -- operator.

The value computation of a postfix increment or decrement is sequenced before the modification of expression. With respect to an indeterminately-sequenced function call, the operation of a postfix increment or decrement is a single evaluation.

#### Overloads

In overload resolution against user-defined operators, for every optionally volatile-qualified arithmetic type A other than bool, and for every optionally volatile-qualified pointer P to optionally cv-qualified object type, the following function signatures participate in overload resolution:

A operator++(A&, int)

bool operator++(bool&, int)

(deprecated)(until C++17)

P operator++(P&, int)

A operator--(A&, int)

P operator--(P&, int)

#### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
int n1 = 1;
int n2 = ++n1;
int n3 = ++ ++n1;
int n4 = n1++;
// int n5 = n1++ ++; // error
// int n6 = n1 + ++n1; // undefined behavior
std::cout << "n1 = " << n1 << '\n'
<< "n2 = " << n2 << '\n'
<< "n3 = " << n3 << '\n'
<< "n4 = " << n4 << '\n';
}

Output:

n1 = 5
n2 = 2
n3 = 4
n4 = 4

### Notes

Because of the side-effects involved, built-in increment and decrement operators must be used with care to avoid undefined behavior due to violations of sequencing rules.

Because a temporary copy of the object is constructed during post-increment and post-decrement, pre-increment or pre-decrement operators are usually more efficient in contexts where the returned value is not used.

### Standard library

Increment and decrement operators are overloaded for many standard library types. In particular, every LegacyIterator overloads operator++ and every LegacyBidirectionalIterator overloads operator--, even if those operators are no-ops for the particular iterator.

applied

- ↑ The prefix ++x is equivalent to x += 1, and the latter is applicable for usual arithmetic conversions (i.e. yield a common type between decltype(x) and int). However, the effect of the postfix x++ is simply “adding one to x”, there is no binary operator present, so no usual arithmetic conversions will take place.
