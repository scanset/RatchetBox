This is the initialization performed when an object is constructed with an empty initializer.

### Syntax

T ()

(1)

new T ()

(2)

Class::Class(...) : member () { ... }

(3)

T object {};

(4)

(since C++11)

T {}

(5)

(since C++11)

new T {}

(6)

(since C++11)

Class::Class(...) : member {} { ... }

(7)

(since C++11)

### Explanation

Value-initialization is performed in these situations:

1,5) when a nameless temporary object is created with the initializer consisting of an empty pair of parentheses or braces(since C++11);

2,6) when an object with dynamic storage duration is created by a new expression with the initializer consisting of an empty pair of parentheses or braces(since C++11);

3,7) when a non-static data member or a base class is initialized using a member initializer with an empty pair of parentheses or braces(since C++11);

4) when a named object (automatic, static, or thread-local) is declared with the initializer consisting of a pair of braces.

In all cases, if the empty pair of braces {} is used and T is an aggregate type, aggregate initialization is performed instead of value-initialization.

If T is a class type that has no default constructor but has a constructor taking std::initializer_list, list-initialization is performed.

(since C++11)

The effects of value-initialization are:

- If T is a (possibly cv-qualified) class type:

- If the default-initialization for T selects a constructor, and the constructor is not user-declared(until C++11)user-provided(since C++11), the object is first zero-initialized.

- In any case, the object is default-initialized.

- Otherwise, if T is an array type, each element of the array is value-initialized.

- Otherwise, the object is zero-initialized.

### Notes

The syntax T object(); does not initialize an object; it declares a function that takes no arguments and returns T. The way to value-initialize a named variable before C++11 was T object = T();, which value-initializes a temporary and then copy-initializes the object: most compilers optimize out the copy in this case.

References cannot be value-initialized.

As described in function-style cast, the syntax T() (1) is prohibited if T names an array type, while T{} (5) is allowed.

All standard containers (std::vector, std::list, etc.) value-initialize their elements when constructed with a single size_type argument or when grown by a call to resize(), unless their allocator customizes the behavior of construct.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
 
struct T1
{
int mem1;
std::string mem2;
virtual void foo() {} // make sure T1 is not an aggregate
}; // implicit default constructor
 
struct T2
{
int mem1;
std::string mem2;
T2(const T2&) {} // user-provided copy constructor
}; // no default constructor
 
struct T3
{
int mem1;
std::string mem2;
T3() {} // user-provided default constructor
};
 
std::string s{}; // class => default-initialization, the value is ""
 
int main()
{
int n{}; // scalar => zero-initialization, the value is 0
assert(n == 0);
double f = double(); // scalar => zero-initialization, the value is 0.0
assert(f == 0.0);
int* a = new int[10](); // array => value-initialization of each element
assert(a[9] == 0); // the value of each element is 0
T1 t1{}; // class with implicit default constructor =>
assert(t1.mem1 == 0); // t1.mem1 is zero-initialized, the value is 0
assert(t1.mem2 == ""); // t1.mem2 is default-initialized, the value is ""
// T2 t2{}; // error: class with no default constructor
T3 t3{}; // class with user-provided default constructor =>
std::cout << t3.mem1; // t3.mem1 is default-initialized to indeterminate value
assert(t3.mem2 == ""); // t3.mem2 is default-initialized, the value is ""
std::vector<int> v(3); // value-initialization of each element
assert(v[2] == 0); // the value of each element is 0
std::cout << '\n';
delete[] a;
}

Possible output:

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

CWG 178

C++98

there was no value-initialization; empty initializer invoked default-
initialization (though new T() also performs zero-initialization)

empty initializer invoke
value-initialization

CWG 543

C++98

value-initialization for a class object without any
user-provided constructors was equivalent to value-
initializing each subobject (which need not zero-
initialize a member with user-provided default constructor)

zero-initializes
the entire object,
then calls the
default constructor

CWG 1301

C++11

value-initialization of unions with deleted
default constructors led to zero-initialization

they are
default-initialized

CWG 1368

C++98

any user-provided constructor caused
zero-initialization to be skipped

only a user-provided
default constructor
skips zero-initialization

CWG 1502

C++11

value-initializing a union without a user-provided
default constructor only zero-initialized the
object, despite default member initializers

performs default-
initialization after
zero-initialization

CWG 1507

C++98

value-initialization for a class object without any
user-provided constructors did not check the validity
of the default constructor when the latter is trivial

the validity of trivial
default constructor
is checked

CWG 2820

C++98

the default-initialization following the zero-
initialization required a non-trivial constructor

not required

CWG 2859

C++98

value-initialization for a class object might involve
zero-initialization even if the default-initialization
does not actually select a user-provided constructor

there is no
zero-initialization
in this case
