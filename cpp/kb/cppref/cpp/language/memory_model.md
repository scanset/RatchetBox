Defines the semantics of computer memory storage for the purpose of the C++ abstract machine.

The memory available to a C++ program is one or more contiguous sequences of bytes. Each byte in memory has a unique address.

### Byte

A byte is the smallest addressable unit of memory. It is defined as a contiguous sequence of bits, large enough to hold

- the value of any UTF-8 code unit (256 distinct values) and of

- any member of the basic execution character set.

(until C++23)

- the ordinary literal encoding of any element of the basic literal character set.

(since C++23)

Similar to C, C++ supports bytes of sizes 8 bits and greater.

The types char, unsigned char, and signed char use one byte for both storage and value representation. The number of bits in a byte is accessible as CHAR_BIT or std::numeric_limits<unsigned char>::digits.

### Memory location

A memory location is the storage occupied by the object representation of either an object of scalar type that is not a bit-field, or the largest contiguous sequence of bit-fields of non-zero length.

Note: Various features of the language, such as references and virtual functions, might involve additional memory locations that are not accessible to programs but are managed by the implementation.

struct S
{
char a; // memory location #1
int b : 5; // memory location #2
int c : 11, // memory location #2 (continued)
: 0,
d : 8; // memory location #3
struct
{
int ee : 8; // memory location #4
} e;
} obj; // The object “obj” consists of 4 separate memory locations
