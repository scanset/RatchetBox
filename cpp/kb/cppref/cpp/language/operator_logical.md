Notes

- The keyword-like forms (and,or,not) and the symbol-like forms (&&,|,!) can be used interchangeably (see alternative representations).

- All built-in operators return bool, and most user-defined overloads also return bool so that the user-defined operators can be used in the same manner as the built-ins. However, in a user-defined operator overload, any type can be used as return type (including void).

- Builtin operators && and | perform short-circuit evaluation (do not evaluate the second operand if the result is known after evaluating the first), but overloaded operators behave like regular function calls and always evaluate both operands.

### Explanation

The logic operator expressions have the form 

! rhs

(1)

lhs && rhs

(2)

lhs | rhs

(3)

1) Logical NOT

2) Logical AND

3) Logical inclusive OR

If the operand is not bool, it is converted to bool using contextual conversion to bool: it is only well-formed if the declaration bool t(arg) is well-formed, for some invented temporary t.

The result is a bool prvalue.

For the built-in logical NOT operator, the result is true if the operand is false. Otherwise, the result is false.

For the built-in logical AND operator, the result is true if both operands are true. Otherwise, the result is false. This operator is short-circuiting: if the first operand is false, the second operand is not evaluated.

For the built-in logical OR operator, the result is true if either the first or the second operand (or both) is true. This operator is short-circuiting: if the first operand is true, the second operand is not evaluated.

Note that bitwise logic operators do not perform short-circuiting.

### Results

a

true

false

!a

false

true

and

false

b

true

true

false

false

false

or

b

true

false

true

false

In overload resolution against user-defined operators, the following built-in function signatures participate in overload resolution:

bool operator!(bool)

bool operator&&(bool, bool)

bool operator|(bool, bool)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
int n = 2;
int* p = &n;
// pointers are convertible to bool
if ( p && *p == 2 // "*p" is safe to use after "p &&"
!p && n != 2) // | has lower precedence than &&
std::cout << "true\n";
 
// streams are also convertible to bool
std::stringstream cin;
cin << "3...\n" << "2...\n" << "1...\n" << "quit";
std::cout << "Enter 'quit' to quit.\n";
for (std::string line; std::cout << "> "
&& std::getline(cin, line)
&& line != "quit";)
std::cout << line << '\n';
}

Output:

true
Enter 'quit' to quit.
> 3...
> 2...
> 1...
>

### Standard library

Because the short-circuiting properties of operator&& and operator| do not apply to overloads, and because types with boolean semantics are uncommon, only two standard library classes overload these operators:

operator!

applies a unary arithmetic operator to each element of the valarray 
(public member function of std::valarray<T>)

operator&&operator

applies binary operators to each element of two valarrays, or a valarray and a value 
(function template)

operator!

checks if an error has occurred (synonym of fail()) 
(public member function of std::basic_ios<CharT,Traits>)

Special operators

static_cast converts one type to another related type

dynamic_cast converts within inheritance hierarchies

const_cast adds or removes cv-qualifiers

reinterpret_cast converts type to unrelated type

C-style cast converts one type to another by a mix of static_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast

new creates objects with dynamic storage duration

delete destructs objects previously created by the new expression and releases obtained memory area

sizeof queries the size of a type

sizeof... queries the size of a pack (since C++11)

typeid queries the type information of a type

noexcept checks if an expression can throw an exception (since C++11)

alignof queries alignment requirements of a type (since C++11)
