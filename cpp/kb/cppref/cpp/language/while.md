Conditionally executes a statement repeatedly.

### Syntax

attr ﻿(optional) while ( condition ) statement

attr

-

(since C++11) any number of attributes

condition

-

a condition

statement

-

a statement (typically a compound statement)

### Condition

A condition can either be an expression or a simple declaration.

- If it can be syntactically resolved as a structured binding declaration, it is interpreted as a structured binding declaration.

(since C++26)

- If it can be syntactically resolved as an expression, it is treated as an expression. Otherwise, it is treated as a declaration that is not a structured binding declaration(since C++26).

When control reaches condition, the condition will yield a value, which is used to determine whether statement will be executed.

#### Expression

If condition is an expression, the value it yields is the the value of the expression contextually converted to bool. If that conversion is ill-formed, the program is ill-formed.

#### Declaration

If condition is a simple declaration, the value it yields is the value of the decision variable (see below) contextually converted to bool. If that conversion is ill-formed, the program is ill-formed.

#### Non-structured binding declaration

The declaration has the following restrictions:

- Syntactically conforms to the following form:

- type-specifier-seq declarator = assignment-expression

(until C++11)

- attribute-specifier-seq(optional) decl-specifier-seq declarator brace-or-equal-initializer

(since C++11)

- The declarator cannot specify a function or an array.

- The type specifier sequence(until C++11)declaration specifier sequence can only contain type specifiers and constexpr, and it(since C++11) cannot define a class or enumeration.

The decision variable of the declaration is the declared variable.

#### Structured binding declaration

The declaration has the following restrictions:

- The expression in its initializer cannot be of an array type.

- The declaration specifier sequence can only contain type specifiers and constexpr.

The decision variable of the declaration is the invented variable e introduced by the declaration.

(since C++26)

### Explanation

A while statement is equivalent to

/* label */ :

{

if ( condition )

{

statement

goto /* label */ ;

}

}

If condition is a declaration, the variable it declares is destroyed and created with each iteration of the loop.

If the loop needs to be terminated within statement, a break statement can be used as terminating statement.

If the current iteration needs to be terminated within statement, a continue statement can be used as shortcut.

### Notes

Regardless of whether statement is a compound statement, it always introduces a block scope. Variables declared in it are only visible in the loop body, in other words,

while (--x >= 0)
int i;
// i goes out of scope

is the same as

while (--x >= 0)
{
int i;
} // i goes out of scope

As part of the C++ forward progress guarantee, the behavior is undefined if a loop that is not a trivial infinite loop(since C++26) without observable behavior does not terminate. Compilers are permitted to remove such loops.

### Keywords

while

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
// while loop with a single statement
int i = 0;
while (i < 10)
i++;
std::cout << i << '\n';
 
// while loop with a compound statement
int j = 2;
while (j < 9)
{
std::cout << j << ' ';
j += 2;
}
std::cout << '\n';
 
// while loop with a declaration condition
char cstr[] = "Hello";
int k = 0;
while (char c = cstr[k++])
std::cout << c;
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

10
2 4 6 8
Hello
