Performs compile-time assertion checking.

### Syntax

static_assert( bool-constexpr , unevaluated-string )

(1)

static_assert( bool-constexpr )

(2)

(since C++17)

static_assert( bool-constexpr , constant-expression )

(3)

(since C++26)

Declares a static assertion. If the assertion fails, the program is ill-formed, and a diagnostic error message may be generated.

1) A static assertion with fixed error message.

2) A static assertion without error message.

3) A static assertion with user-generated error message.

This syntax can only be matched if syntax (1) does not match.

### Explanation

bool-constexpr

-

a contextually converted constant expression of type bool. Built-in conversions are not allowed, except for non-narrowing integral conversions to bool.

(until C++23)

an expression contextually converted to bool where the conversion is a constant expression

(since C++23)

unevaluated-string

-

an unevaluated string literal that will appear as the error message

constant-expression

-

a constant expression msg satisfying all following conditions:

- msg.size() is implicitly convertible to std::size_t.

- msg.data() is implicitly convertible to const char*.

A static_assert declaration may appear at namespace and block scope (as a block declaration) and inside a class body (as a member declaration).

If bool-constexpr is well-formed and evaluates to true, or is evaluated in the context of a template definition and the template is uninstantiated, this declaration has no effect. Otherwise a compile-time error is issued, and the user-provided message, if any, is included in the diagnostic message.

The text of the user-provided message is determined as follows:

- If the message matches the syntactic requirements of unevaluated-string, the text of the message is the text of the unevaluated-string.

- Otherwise, given the following values:

- Let msg denote the value of constant-expression.

- Let len denote the value of msg.size(), which must be a converted constant expression of type std::size_t.

- Let ptr denote the expression msg.data(), implicitly converted to const char*. ptr must be a core constant expression.

The text of the message is formed by the sequence of len code units, starting at ptr, of the ordinary literal encoding. For each integer i in [​0​, len), ptr[i] must be an integral constant expression.

(since C++26)

### Notes

The standard does not require a compiler to print the verbatim text of error message, though compilers generally do so as much as possible.

Since the error message has to be a string literal, it cannot contain dynamic information or even a constant expression that is not a string literal itself. In particular, it cannot contain the name of the template type argument.

### Example

Run this code

#include <format>
#include <type_traits>
 
static_assert(03301 == 1729); // since C++17 the message string is optional
 
template<class T>
void swap(T& a, T& b) noexcept
{
static_assert(std::is_copy_constructible_v<T>,
"Swap requires copying");
static_assert(std::is_nothrow_copy_constructible_v<T> &&
std::is_nothrow_copy_assignable_v<T>,
"Swap requires nothrow copy/assign");
auto c = b;
b = a;
a = c;
}
 
template<class T>
struct data_structure
{
static_assert(std::is_default_constructible_v<T>,
"Data structure requires default-constructible elements");
};
 
template<class>
constexpr bool dependent_false = false; // workaround before CWG2518/P2593R1
 
template<class T>
struct bad_type
{
static_assert(dependent_false<T>, "error on instantiation, workaround");
static_assert(false, "error on instantiation"); // OK because of CWG2518/P2593R1
};
 
struct no_copy
{
no_copy(const no_copy&) = delete;
no_copy() = default;
};
 
struct no_default
{
no_default() = delete;
};
 
#if __cpp_static_assert >= 202306L
// Not real C++ yet (std::format should be constexpr to work):
static_assert(sizeof(int) == 4, std::format("Expected 4, got {}", sizeof(int)));
#endif
 
int main()
{
int a, b;
swap(a, b);
 
no_copy nc_a, nc_b;
swap(nc_a, nc_b); // 1
 
[[maybe_unused]] data_structure<int> ds_ok;
[[maybe_unused]] data_structure<no_default> ds_error; // 2
}

Possible output:

1: error: static assertion failed: Swap requires copying
2: error: static assertion failed: Data structure requires default-constructible elements
3: error: static assertion failed: Expected 4, got 2
