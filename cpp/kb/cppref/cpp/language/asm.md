asm-declaration gives the ability to embed assembly language source code within a C++ program. This declaration is conditionally-supported and (since C++11)implementation defined, 
meaning that it may not be present and, even when provided by the implementation, (since C++11)it does not have a fixed meaning.

### Syntax

attr ﻿(optional) asm ( string-literal ) ;

(until C++26)

attr ﻿(optional) asm ( balanced-token-seq ) ;

(since C++26)

attr

-

(since C++11) any number of attributes

string-literal

-

same as in string literal, including raw string literals

balanced-token-seq

-

a sequence of tokens where parentheses, brackets and braces are balanced; any restrictions on the balanced-token-seq and its meaning are implementation-defined

### Explanation

The balanced-token-seq is typically a string literal that represents a short program written in assembly language, which is executed whenever this declaration is executed. Different C++ compilers have wildly varying rules for asm-declarations, and different conventions for the interaction with the surrounding C++ code.

As other block declarations, this declaration can appear inside a block (a function body or another compound statement), and, as all other declarations, this declaration can also appear outside a block.

This section is incomplete
Reason: write a note on GCC extended assembly syntax, since it is now supported by Intel, IBM, Sun (as of v12), etc

### Example

Demonstrates two kinds of inline assembly syntax offered by the GCC/Clang compilers. This program works correctly only on the x86_64 platform under Linux.

Run this code

#include <iostream>
 
extern "C" int func(int x);
// the definition of func is written in assembly language
// raw string literal could be very useful
asm(R"(
.globl func
.type func, @function
func:
.cfi_startproc
movl %edi, %eax /* x is in RDI, see x86-64 calling convention */
addl $1, %eax
ret
.cfi_endproc
)");
 
int main()
{
int n = func(0110);
// formerly non-standard inline assembly, made comforming by P2361R6
asm ("leal (%0,%0,4),%0"
: "=r" (n)
: "0" (n));
std::cout << "73*5 = " << n << std::endl; // flush is intentional
 
// standard inline assembly
asm ("movq $60, %rax\n" // the exit syscall number on Linux
"movq $2,  %rdi\n" // this program returns 2
"syscall");
}

Output:

73*5 = 365
