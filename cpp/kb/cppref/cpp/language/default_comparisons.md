Comparison operator functions can be explicitly defaulted to request the compiler to generate the corresponding default comparison for a class.

### Definition

A defaulted comparison operator function is a non-template comparison operator function (i.e. <=>, ==, !=, <, >, <=, or >=) satisfying all following conditions:

- It is a non-static member or friend of some class C.

- It is defined as defaulted in C or in a context where C is complete.

- It has two parameters of type const C& or two parameters of type C, where the implicit object parameter (if any) is considered to be the first parameter.

Such a comparison operator function is termed a defaulted comparison operator function for class C.

struct X
{
bool operator==(const X&) const = default; // OK
bool operator==(const X&) = default; // Error: the implicit object
// parameter type is X&
bool operator==(this X, X) = default; // OK
};
 
struct Y
{
friend bool operator==(Y, Y) = default; // OK
friend bool operator==(Y, const Y&) = default; // Error: different parameter types
};
 
bool operator==(const Y&, const Y&) = default; // Error: not a friend of Y

Name lookups and access checks in the implicit definition of a comparison operator function are performed from a context equivalent to its function body. A definition of a comparison operator function as defaulted that appears in a class must be the first declaration of that function.

### Default comparison order

Given a class C, a subobject list is formed by the following subjects in order:

- The direct base class subobjects of C, in declaration order.

- The non-static data members of C, in declaration order.

- If any member subobject is of array type, it is expanded to the sequence of its elements, in the order of increasing subscript. The expansion is recursive: array elements of array types will be expanded again until there is no subobject of array type.

For any object x of type C, in the following descriptions:

- Let n be the number of subobjects in the (expanded) subobject list for x.

- Let x_i be the ith subobject in the (expanded) subobject list for x, where x_i is formed by a sequence of derived-to-base conversions, class member access expressions, and array subscript expressions applied to x.

struct S {};
 
struct T : S
{
int arr[2][2];
} t;
 
// The subobject list for “t” consists of the following 5 subobjects in order:
// (S)t → t[0][0] → t[0][1] → t[1][0] → t[1][1]

### Three-way comparison

An operator<=> for a class type can be defined as defaulted with any return type.

#### Comparison category types

There are three comparison category types:

- std::strong_ordering

- std::weak_ordering

- std::partial_ordering

 Incomparable values are..

#### Synthesized three-way comparison

The synthesized three-way comparison of type T between glvalues a and b of the same type is defined as follows:

- If the overload resolution for a <=> b results in a usable candidate, and can be explicitly converted to T using static_cast, the synthesized comparison is static_cast<T>(a <=> b).

- Otherwise, if any of the following condition is satisfied, the synthesized comparison is not defined:

- The overload resolution for a <=> b finds at least one viable candidate.

- T is not a comparison category type.

- The overload resolution for a == b does not result in a usable candidate.

- The overload resolution for a < b does not result in a usable candidate.

- Otherwise, if T is std::strong_ordering, the synthesized comparison is

a == b ? std::strong_ordering::equal :
a < b ? std::strong_ordering::less :
std::strong_ordering::greater

- Otherwise, if T is std::weak_ordering, the synthesized comparison is

a == b ? std::weak_ordering::equivalent :
a < b ? std::weak_ordering::less :
std::weak_ordering::greater

- Otherwise (T is std::partial_ordering), the synthesized comparison is

a == b ? std::partial_ordering::equivalent :
a < b ? std::partial_ordering::less :
b < a ? std::partial_ordering::greater : 
std::partial_ordering::unordered

#### Placeholder return type

If the declared return type of a defaulted three-way comparison operator function (operator<=>) for a class type C is auto, the return type is deduced from the return types of the three-way comparisons between the corresponding subobjects of an object x of type C.

For each subobject x_i in the (expanded) subobject list for x:

- Perform overload resolution for x_i <=> x_i, if the overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate, the defaulted operator<=> is defined as deleted.

- Denote the cv-unqualified version of the type of x_i <=> x_i as R_i, if R_i is not a comparison category type, the defaulted operator<=> is defined as deleted.

If the defaulted operator<=> is not defined as deleted, its return type is deduced as std::common_comparison_category_t<R_1, R_2, ..., R_n>.

#### Non-placeholder return type

If the declared return type of the defaulted operator<=> is not auto, it cannot contain any placeholder type (e.g. decltype(auto)).

If there is a subobject x_i in the (expanded) subobject list for x such that the synthesized three-way comparison of the declared return type between x_i and x_i is not defined, the defaulted operator<=> is defined as deleted.

#### Comparison result

Let x and y be the parameters of a defaulted operator<=>, denote each subobject in the (expanded) subobject list for x and y as x_i and y_i respectively. The default three-way comparison between x and y is performed by comparing corresponding subobjects x_i and y_i with increasing i order.

Let R be the (possibly-deduced) return type, the comparison result between x_i and y_i is the result of the synthesized three-way comparison of type R between x_i and y_i.

- During the default three-way comparison between x and y, if a subobject-wise comparison between x_i and y_i generates a result v_i such that contextually converting v_i != 0 to bool yields true, the return value is a copy of v_i (the remaining subobjects will not be compared).

- Otherwise, the return value is static_cast<R>(std::strong_ordering::equal).

Run this code

#include <compare>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
 
struct Point
{
int x;
int y;
auto operator<=>(const Point&) const = default;
/* non-comparison functions */
};
 
int main()
{
Point pt1{1, 1}, pt2{1, 2};
std::set<Point> s; // OK
s.insert(pt1); // OK
 
// two-way comparison operator functions are not required to be explicitly defined:
// operator== is implicitly declared (see below)
// the overload resolutions of other candidates will select rewritten candidates 
std::cout << std::boolalpha
<< (pt1 == pt2) << ' ' // false
<< (pt1 != pt2) << ' ' // true
<< (pt1 < pt2) << ' ' // true
<< (pt1 <= pt2) << ' ' // true
<< (pt1 > pt2) << ' ' // false
<< (pt1 >= pt2) << ' '; // false
}

### Equality comparison

#### Explicit declaration

An operator== for a class type can be defined as defaulted with return type bool.

Given a class C and an object x of type C, if there is a subobject x_i in the (expanded) subobject list for x such that the overload resolution for x_i == x_i does not result in a usable candidate, the defaulted operator== is defined as deleted.

Let x and y be the parameters of a defaulted operator==, denote each subobject in the (expanded) subobject list for x and y as x_i and y_i respectively. The default equality comparison between x and y is performed by comparing corresponding subobjects x_i and y_i with increasing i order.

The comparison result between x_i and y_i is the result of x_i == y_i.

- During the default equality comparison between x and y, if a subobject-wise comparison between x_i and y_i generates a result v_i such that contextually converting v_i to bool yields false, the return value is false (the remaining subobjects will not be compared).

- Otherwise, the return value is true.

Run this code

#include <iostream>
 
struct Point
{
int x;
int y;
bool operator==(const Point&) const = default;
/* non-comparison functions */
};
 
int main()
{
Point pt1{3, 5}, pt2{2, 5};
std::cout << std::boolalpha
<< (pt1 != pt2) << '\n' // true
<< (pt1 == pt1) << '\n'; // true
 
struct [[maybe_unused]] { int x{}, y{}; } p, q;
// if (p == q) {} // Error: operator== is not defined
}

#### Implicit declaration

If a class C does not explicitly declare any member or friend named operator==, an operator function is declared implicitly for each operator<=> defined as defaulted. Each implicity-declared operator== have the same access and function definition and in the same class scope as the respective defaulted operator<=>, with the following changes:

- The declarator identifier is replaced with operator==.

- The return type is replaced with bool.

template<typename T>
struct X
{
friend constexpr std::partial_ordering operator<=>(X, X)
requires (sizeof(T) != 1) = default;
// implicitly declares: friend constexpr bool operator==(X, X)
// requires (sizeof(T) != 1) = default;
 
[[nodiscard]] virtual std::strong_ordering operator<=>(const X&) const = default;
// implicitly declares: [[nodiscard]] virtual bool
// operator==(const X&) const = default;
};

### Secondary comparison

A secondary comparison operator function (!=, <, >, <=, or >=) for a class type can be defined as defaulted with return type bool.

Let @ be one of the five secondary comparison operators, for each defaulted operator@ with parameters x and y, up to two overloads resolutions are performed (not considering the defaulted operator@ as a candidate) to determine whether it is defined as deleted.

- The first overload resolution is performed for x @ y. If the overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate, or the selected candidate is not a rewritten candidate, the defaulted operator@ is defined as deleted. There is no second overload resolution in these cases.

- The second overload resolution is performed for the selected rewritten candidate of x @ y. If the overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate, the defaulted operator@ is defined as deleted.

If is x @ y cannot be implicitly converted to bool, the defaulted operator@ is defined as deleted.

If the defaulted operator@ is not defined as deleted, it yields x @ y.

struct HasNoRelational {};
 
struct C
{
friend HasNoRelational operator<=>(const C&, const C&);
bool operator<(const C&) const = default; // OK, function is defaulted
};
