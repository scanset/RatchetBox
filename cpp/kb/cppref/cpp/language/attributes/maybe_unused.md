Suppresses warnings on unused entities.

### Syntax

[[maybe_unused]]

### Explanation

This attribute can appear in the declaration of the following entities:

- class/struct/union: struct [[maybe_unused]] S;

- typedef, including those declared by alias declaration: [[maybe_unused]] typedef S* PS;, using PS [[maybe_unused]] = S*;

- variable, including static data member: [[maybe_unused]] int x;

- non-static data member: union U { [[maybe_unused]] int n; };,

- function: [[maybe_unused]] void f();

- enumeration: enum [[maybe_unused]] E {};

- enumerator: enum { A [[maybe_unused]], B [[maybe_unused]] = 42 };

- structured binding: [[maybe_unused]] auto [a, b] = std::make_pair(42, 0.23);

For entities declared [[maybe_unused]], if the entities or their structured bindings are unused, the warning on unused entities issued by the compiler is suppressed.

For labels declared [[maybe_unused]], if they are unused, the warning on unused labels issued by the compiler is suppressed.

(since C++26)

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
 
[[maybe_unused]] void f([[maybe_unused]] bool thing1,
[[maybe_unused]] bool thing2)
{
[[maybe_unused]] lb: // the label “lb” is not used, no warning
[[maybe_unused]] bool b = thing1 && thing2;
assert(b); // in release mode, assert is compiled out, and “b” is unused
// no warning because it is declared [[maybe_unused]]
} // parameters “thing1” and “thing2” are not used, no warning
 
int main() {}
