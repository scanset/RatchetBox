Specifies that the given expression is assumed to always evaluate to true at a given point in order to allow compiler optimizations based on the information given.

### Syntax

[[assume( expression )]]

expression

-

any expression (except unparenthesized comma expressions)

### Explanation

[[assume]] an only be applied to a null statement, as in [[assume(x > 0)]];. This statement is called an assumption.

expression is contextually converted to bool, but it is not evaluated (it is still potentially evaluated).

- If the converted expression would evaluate to true at the point where the assumption appears, the assumption has no effect.

- Otherwise, evaluation of the assumption has runtime-undefined behavior.

### Notes

Since assumptions cause runtime-undefined behavior if they do not hold, they should be used sparingly.

One correct way to use them is to follow assertions with assumptions:

assert(x > 0); // trigger an assertion when NDEBUG is not defined and x > 0 is false
[[assume(x > 0)]]; // provide optimization opportunities when NDEBUG is defined

### Example

#include <cmath>
 
void f(int& x, int y)
{
void g(int);
void h();
 
[[assume(x > 0)]]; // Compiler may assume x is positive
 
g(x / 2); // More efficient code possibly generated
 
x = 3;
int z = x;
 
[[assume((h(), x == z))]]; // Compiler may assume x would have the same value after
// calling h
// The assumption does not cause a call to h
 
h();
g(x); // Compiler may replace this with g(3);
 
h();
g(x); // Compiler may NOT replace this with g(3);
// An assumption applies only at the point where it appears
 
z = std::abs(y);
 
[[assume((g(z), true))]]; // Compiler may assume g(z) will return
 
g(z); // Due to above and below assumptions, compiler may replace this with g(10);
 
[[assume(y == -10)]]; // Undefined behavior if y != -10 at this point
 
[[assume((x - 1) * 3 == 12)]];
 
g(x); // Compiler may replace this with g(5);
}
