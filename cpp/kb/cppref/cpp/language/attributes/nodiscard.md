If a function declared nodiscard or a function returning an enumeration or class declared nodiscard by value is called from a discarded-value expression other than a cast to void, the compiler is encouraged to issue a warning.

### Syntax

[[nodiscard]]

(1)

(since C++17)

[[nodiscard( string-literal )]]

(2)

(since C++20)

string-literal

-

an unevaluated string literal that could be used to explain the rationale for why the result should not be discarded

### Explanation

Appears in a function declaration, enumeration declaration, or class declaration.

If, from a discarded-value expression other than a cast to void,

- a function declared nodiscard is called, or

- a function returning an enumeration or class declared nodiscard by value is called, or

- a constructor declared nodiscard is called by explicit type conversion or static_cast, or

- an object of an enumeration or class type declared nodiscard is initialized by explicit type conversion or static_cast,

the compiler is encouraged to issue a warning.

The string-literal, if specified, is usually included in the warnings.

(since C++20)

### Example

Run this code

struct [[nodiscard]] error_info { /*...*/ };
 
error_info enable_missile_safety_mode() { /*...*/ return {}; }
 
void launch_missiles() { /*...*/ }
 
void test_missiles()
{
enable_missile_safety_mode(); // compiler may warn on discarding a nodiscard value
launch_missiles();
}
 
error_info& foo() { static error_info e; /*...*/ return e; }
 
void f1() { foo(); } // nodiscard type is not returned by value, no warning
 
// nodiscard( string-literal ) (since C++20):
[[nodiscard("PURE FUN")]] int strategic_value(int x, int y) { return x ^ y; }
 
int main()
{
strategic_value(4, 2); // compiler may warn on discarding a nodiscard value
auto z = strategic_value(0, 0); // OK: return value is not discarded
return z;
}

Possible output:

game.cpp:5:4: warning: ignoring return value of function declared with ⮠
'nodiscard' attribute
game.cpp:17:5: warning: ignoring return value of function declared with ⮠
'nodiscard' attribute: PURE FUN
