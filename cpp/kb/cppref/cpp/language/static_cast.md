Converts between types using a combination of implicit and user-defined conversions.

### Syntax

static_cast<target-type ﻿>(expression ﻿)

Returns a value of type target-type.

### Explanation

Only the following conversions can be done with static_cast, except when such conversions would cast away constness (or volatility).

1) If expression is an lvalue of type “cv1 Base” and target-type is “reference to cv2 Derived”, the result refers to the object of type Derived enclosing expression if all following conditions are satisfied:

- Derived is a complete class type.

- Base is a base class of Derived.

- cv1 is not a greater cv-qualification than cv2.

If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the program is ill-formed:

- Base is a virtual base class of Derived.

- Base is a base class of a virtual base class of Derived.

- No valid standard conversion from “pointer to Derived” to “pointer to Base” exists.

If expression is actually not a base class subobject of an object of type Derived, the behavior is undefined.
struct B {};
struct D : B { B b; };
 
D d;
B& br1 = d;
B& br2 = d.b;
 
static_cast<D&>(br1); // OK, lvalue denoting the original “d” object
static_cast<D&>(br2); // UB: the “b” subobject is not a base class subobject

2) If target-type is “rvalue reference to Derived” and expression is an xvalue of type “(possibly cv-qualified) Base” such that Base is a base class of Derived, the result and constraints of such a conversion are the same as those of the “Base lvalue to Derived reference” conversion.

3) If target-type is an rvalue reference type and the referenced type is reference-compatible with the type of expression, static_cast converts the value of glvalue, class prvalue, or array prvalue(until C++17)any lvalue(since C++17) expression to xvalue referring to the same object as the expression, or to its base class subobject (depending on target-type).[1]

If target-type is an inaccessible or ambiguous base of the type of expression, the program is ill-formed.

If expression is a bit-field lvalue, it is first converted to prvalue of the underlying type.

(since C++11)

4) If target-type is the (possibly cv-qualified) void, the conversion has no result. In this case, expression is a discarded-value expression.

5) Otherwise, expression can be explicitly converted to target-type if

the declaration target-type temp(expression ﻿); is well-formed for some invented temporary variable temp.

The effect of such an explicit conversion is the same as performing the declaration and initialization and then using temp as the result of the conversion. The expression ﻿ is used as an lvalue(until C++11)a glvalue(since C++11) if and only if the initialization uses it as an lvalue(until C++11)a glvalue(since C++11).

(until C++17)

any of the following conditions is satisfied:

- There is an implicit conversion sequence from expression to target-type.

- The overload resolution for a direct-initialization of an object or reference of type target-type from expression would find at least one viable function.

- target-type is an aggregate type having a first element x and there is an implicit conversion sequence from expression to the type of x.

(since C++20)

The explicit conversion is defined as follows:

- If target-type is a reference type, the effect is the same as performing the declaration and initialization target-type temp(expression ﻿); for some invented temporary variable temp and then using temp as the result of the conversion.

- Otherwise, the result object is direct-initialized from expression ﻿.

(since C++17)

6) Otherwise, if the conversion from expression to target-type is an inverse of a standard conversion sequence, and the conversion sequence does not contain any of the following conversions, the conversion can be performed by static_cast:

- lvalue-to-rvalue conversion

- array-to-pointer conversion

- function-to-pointer conversion

- null pointer conversion

- null member pointer conversion

- boolean conversion

- function pointer conversion

(since C++17)

If a program uses static_cast to perform the inverse of an ill-formed standard conversion sequence, it is ill-formed.

7) Otherwise, lvalue-to-rvalue, array-to-pointer, and function-to-pointer conversions are applied to expression. After these conversions, only the following conversions can be performed by static_cast:

a) A value of scoped enumeration type can be converted to an integer or floating-point type.

- If target-type is (possibly cv-qualified) bool, the result is false if the original value of expression is zero and true for all other values.

- If target-type is an integral type other than (possibly cv-qualified) bool, the value is unchanged if the original value of expression can be represented by target-type. Otherwise, the resulting value is unspecified.

(until C++20)

- If target-type is an integral type, the result is the same as that of converting to the enumeration’s underlying type and then to target-type.

(since C++20)

- If target-type is a floating-point type, the result is the same as that of converting from the original value to target-type.

(since C++11)

b) A value of integer or enumeration type can be converted to any complete enumeration type.

- If target-type has a fixed underlying type, expression is first converted to that type by integral promotion or integral conversion, if necessary, and then to target-type.

- If target-type does not have a fixed underlying type, the value of expression is unchanged if the original value is within the range of the enumeration values, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

c) A value of a floating-point type can also be converted to any complete enumeration type. The result is the same as converting the original value of expression first to the underlying type of target-type, and then to target-type itself.

d) A prvalue of floating-point type can be explicitly converted to any other floating-point type.

- If the source value of expression can be represented exactly in target-type, it does not change.

- Otherwise, if the source value of expression is between two representable values of target-type, the result of the conversion is an implementation-defined choice of either of those values.[2]

- Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

(since C++23)

e) An rvalue(until C++11)A prvalue(since C++11) of type “pointer to cv1 Base” can be explicitly converted to the type “pointer to cv2 Derived” if all following conditions are satisfied:

- Derived is a complete class type.

- Base is a base class of Derived.

- cv1 is not a greater cv-qualification than cv2.

If expression is a null pointer value, the result is a null pointer value of type target-type. Otherwise, the result is a pointer to the object of type Derived enclosing the object of type Base pointed to by expression.

If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the program is ill-formed:

- Base is a virtual base class of Derived.

- Base is a base class of a virtual base class of Derived.

- No valid standard conversion from “pointer to Derived” to “pointer to Base” exists.

If expression is not a null pointer value and does not actually point to a base class subobject of an object of type Derived, the behavior is undefined.

f) An rvalue(until C++11)A prvalue(since C++11) of type “pointer to member of Derived of type cv1 T” can be explicitly converted to the type “pointer to member of Base of type cv2 T” if all following conditions are satisfied:

- Derived is a complete class type.

- Base is a base class of Derived.

- cv1 is not a greater cv-qualification than cv2.

If expression is a null member pointer value, the result is a null member pointer value of type target-type. Otherwise, the result is a pointer to the original (possibly indirect) member of class Base.

If no valid standard conversion from “pointer to member of Base of type T” to “pointer to member of Derived of type T” exists, the program is ill-formed.

If expression is not a null member pointer value and the member it denotes is not a (possibly indirect) member of class Base, the behavior is undefined.

g) An rvalue(until C++11)A prvalue(since C++11) of type “pointer to cv1 void” can be explicitly converted to the type “pointer to cv2 T” if T is an object type and cv1 is not a greater cv-qualification than cv2.

- If expression is a null pointer value, the result is a null pointer value of type target-type.

- If the expression represents the address A of a byte in memory and A satisfies the alignment requirement of T, then the resulting pointer value also represents A.

- The result of any other such pointer conversion is unspecified.

- If expression the result of a prior conversion from an object of type “pointer to cv3 T”, the result has the original value.

(until C++17)

- If expression represents the address A of a byte in memory but A does not satisfy the alignment requirement of T, then the resulting pointer value is unspecified.

- Otherwise, if expression points to an object a, and there is an object b of type T (ignoring cv-qualification) that is pointer-interconvertible (see below) with a, the result is a pointer to b.

- Otherwise, the pointer value is unchanged by the conversion.

(since C++17)

As with all cast expressions, the result is:

- an lvalue if target-type is an lvalue reference type or an rvalue reference to function type(since C++11);

- an xvalue if target-type is an rvalue reference to object type;

(since C++11)

- a prvalue otherwise.

- ↑ This type of static_cast is used to implement move semantics in std::move.

- ↑ If IEEE arithmetic is supported, rounding defaults to nearest.

### Pointer-interconvertible objects

Two objects a and b are pointer-interconvertible if:

- they are the same object, or

- one is a union object and the other is a non-static data member of that object, or

- one is a standard-layout class object and the other is the first non-static data member of that object or any base class subobject of that object, or

- there exists an object c such that a and c are pointer-interconvertible, and c and b are pointer-interconvertible.

union U { int a; double b; } u;
void* x = &u; // x's value is “pointer to u”
double* y = static_cast<double*>(x); // y's value is “pointer to u.b”
char* z = static_cast<char*>(x); // z's value is “pointer to u”

### Notes

Base-to-derived conversions (downcasts) using static_cast make no runtime checks to ensure that the dynamic type of the pointed/referred object is Derived, and may only be used safely if this precondition is guaranteed by other means, such as when implementing static polymorphism. Safe downcast may be done with dynamic_cast.

static_cast may also be used to disambiguate function overloads by performing a function-to-pointer conversion to specific type, as in

std::for_each(files.begin(), files.end(),
static_cast<std::ostream&(*)(std::ostream&)>(std::flush));

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
 
struct B
{
int m = 42;
const char* hello() const
{
return "Hello world, this is B!\n";
}
};
 
struct D : B
{
const char* hello() const
{
return "Hello world, this is D!\n";
}
};
 
enum class E { ONE = 1, TWO, THREE };
enum EU { ONE = 1, TWO, THREE };
 
int main()
{
// 1. static downcast
D d;
B& br = d; // upcast via implicit conversion
std::cout << "1) " << br.hello();
D& another_d = static_cast<D&>(br); // downcast
std::cout << "1) " << another_d.hello();
 
// 3. lvalue to xvalue
std::vector<int> v0{1, 2, 3};
std::vector<int> v2 = static_cast<std::vector<int>&&>(v0);
std::cout << "3) after move, v0.size() = " << v0.size() << '\n';
 
// 4. discarded-value expression
static_cast<void>(v2.size());
 
// 5. initializing conversion
int n = static_cast<int>(3.14);
std::cout << "5) n = " << n << '\n';
std::vector<int> v = static_cast<std::vector<int>>(10);
std::cout << "5) v.size() = " << v.size() << '\n';
 
// 6. inverse of implicit conversion
void* nv = &n;
int* ni = static_cast<int*>(nv);
std::cout << "6) *ni = " << *ni << '\n';
 
// 7a. scoped enum to int
E e = E::TWO;
int two = static_cast<int>(e);
std::cout << "7a) " << two << '\n';
 
// 7b. int to enum, enum to another enum
E e2 = static_cast<E>(two);
[[maybe_unused]]
EU eu = static_cast<EU>(e2);
 
// 7f. pointer to member upcast
int D::*pm = &D::m;
std::cout << "7f) " << br.*static_cast<int B::*>(pm) << '\n';
 
// 7g. void* to any object pointer
void* voidp = &e;
[[maybe_unused]]
std::vector<int>* p = static_cast<std::vector<int>*>(voidp);
}

Output:

1) Hello world, this is B!
1) Hello world, this is D!
3) after move, v0.size() = 0
5) n = 3
5) v.size() = 10
6) *ni = 3
7a) 2
7f) 42
