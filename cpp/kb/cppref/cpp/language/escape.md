Escape sequences are used to represent certain special characters within string literals and character literals. 

The following escape sequences are available:

Numeric escape sequences

\nnn

arbitrary octal value

code unit nnn (1~3 octal digits)

\o{n...} (since C++23)

code unit n... (arbitrary number of octal digits)

\xn...

arbitrary hexadecimal value

code unit n... (arbitrary number of hexadecimal digits)

\x{n...} (since C++23)

Conditional escape sequences[1]

\c

Implementation-defined

Universal character names

\unnnn

arbitrary Unicode value;
may result in several code units

code point U+nnnn (4 hexadecimal digits)

\u{n...} (since C++23)

code point U+n... (arbitrary number of hexadecimal digits)

\Unnnnnnnn

code point U+nnnnnnnn (8 hexadecimal digits)

\N{NAME} (since C++23)

arbitrary Unicode character

character named by NAME (see below)

- ↑ Conditional escape sequences are conditionally-supported. The character c in each conditional escape sequence is a member of basic source character set(until C++23)basic character set(since C++23) that is not the character following the \ in any other escape sequence.

### Range of universal character names

If a universal character name corresponds to a code point that is not 0x24 ($), 0x40 (@), nor 0x60 (`) and less than 0xA0, the program is ill-formed. In other words, members of basic source character set and control characters (in ranges 0x0-0x1F and 0x7F-0x9F) cannot be expressed in universal character names.

(until C++11)

If a universal character name corresponding to a code point of a member of basic source character set or control characters appear outside a character or string literal, the program is ill-formed.

If a universal character name corresponds surrogate code point (the range 0xD800-0xDFFF, inclusive), the program is ill-formed.

If a universal character name used in a UTF-16/32 string literal does not correspond to a code point in ISO/IEC 10646 (the range 0x0-0x10FFFF, inclusive), the program is ill-formed.

(since C++11)
(until C++20)

If a universal character name corresponding to a code point of a member of basic source character set or control characters appear outside a character or string literal, the program is ill-formed.

If a universal character name does not correspond to a code point in ISO/IEC 10646 (the range 0x0-0x10FFFF, inclusive) or corresponds to a surrogate code point (the range 0xD800-0xDFFF, inclusive), the program is ill-formed.

(since C++20)
(until C++23)

If a universal character name corresponding to a scalar value of a character in the basic character set or a control character appear outside a character or string literal, the program is ill-formed.

If a universal character name does not correspond to a scalar value of a character in the translation character set, the program is ill-formed.

(since C++23)

#### Named universal character escapes

\N{ n-char-sequence }

n-char-sequence

-

one or more n-chars

n-char

-

a character from the translation character set, except the right curly bracket } or new-line character

A universal character name of the syntax above is a named universal character. It designates the corresponding character in the Unicode Standard (chapter 4.8 Name) if the n-char-sequence is equal to its character name or to one of its character name aliases of type “control”, “correction”, or “alternate”; otherwise, the program is ill-formed.

These aliases are listed in the Unicode Character Database’s NameAliases.txt. None of these names or aliases have leading or trailing spaces.

A valid n-char-sequence must contain only uppercase Latin letters A through Z, digits, space, and hyphen-minus. Other characters never occur in a Unicode character name, and thus their appearance in a n-char-sequence always renders the program ill-formed.

(since C++23)

### Notes

\0 is the most commonly used octal escape sequence, because it represents the terminating null character in null-terminated strings.

The new-line character \n has special meaning when used in text mode I/O: it is converted to the OS-specific newline representation, usually a byte or byte sequence. Some systems mark their lines with length fields instead.

Octal escape sequences have a limit of three octal digits, but terminate at the first character that is not a valid octal digit if encountered sooner.

Hexadecimal escape sequences have no length limit and terminate at the first character that is not a valid hexadecimal digit. If the value represented by a single hexadecimal escape sequence does not fit the range of values represented by the character type used in this string literal (char, char8_t, (since C++20)char16_t, char32_t, (since C++11)or wchar_t), the result is unspecified.

A universal character name in a narrow string literal or a 16-bit string literal may map to more than one code unit, e.g. \U0001f34c is 4 char code units in UTF-8 (\xF0\x9F\x8D\x8C) and 2 char16_t code units in UTF-16 (\xD83C\xDF4C).

(since C++11)

The question mark escape sequence \? is used to prevent trigraphs from being interpreted inside string literals: a string such as "??/" is compiled as "\", but if the second question mark is escaped, as in "?\?/", it becomes "??/". As trigraphs have been removed from C++, the question mark escape sequence is no longer necessary. It is preserved for compatibility with C++14 (and former revisions) and C.(since C++17)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::cout << "This\nis\na\ntest\n\n";
std::cout << "She said, \"Sells she seashells on the seashore?\"\n";
}

Output:
