This page tries to list all the symbols that are available from the standard library (date and time library) in the namespace std::literals::chrono_literals. The symbols are written as follows:

- Function names with ().

- Templates with <>.

### Notes

These operators are declared in the namespace std::literals::chrono_literals, where both literals and chrono_literals are inline namespaces. Access to these operators can be gained with:

- using namespace std::literals,

- using namespace std::chrono_literals, or

- using namespace std::literals::chrono_literals.

In addition, within the namespace std::chrono, the directive using namespace literals::chrono_literals; is provided by the standard library, so that if a programmer uses using namespace std::chrono; to gain access to the classes in the chrono library, the corresponding literal operators become visible as well.
