(5)
(since C++23)

An implementation of coroutine interface functions used internally to support operator co_yield.

(yielded is a reference type defined in std::generator.)

1) Assigns std::addressof(val) to value_. Returns {}.

2) Returns an awaitable object x of an unspecified type that stores an object of type std::remove_cvref_t<yielded>. x is direct-non-list-initialized with lval, whose member functions are configured so that value_ points to that stored object. Then suspends the coroutine.

3, 4) Let x be some generator object.
Returns an awaitable object of an unspecified type into which g.range is moved,

- whose member await_ready returns false,

- whose member await_suspend pushes g.range.coroutine_ into *x.active_ and

- resumes execution of the coroutine referred to by g.range.coroutine_, and

- whose member await_resume evaluates

- std::rethrow_exception(except_) if bool(except_) is true.

- If bool(except_) is false, the await_resume member has no effects.

The coroutine referred to by g.range.coroutine_ must be suspended at its initial suspend point. Otherwise the behavior is undefined.

5) Equivalent to:
auto nested = [](std::allocator_arg_t, Alloc, ranges::iterator_t<R> i,
ranges::sentinel_t<R> s) ->
std::generator<yielded, void, Alloc>
{
for (; i != s; ++i)
co_yield static_cast<yielded>(*i);
};
 
return yield_value(ranges::elements_of(nested(
allocator_arg, r.allocator, ranges::begin(r.range), ranges::end(r.range))));

2,3) A handle referring to the coroutine whose promise object is *this must be at the top of *active_ of some generator object. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

2-5) A yield-expression that calls these overload has the type void.

### Parameters

val

-

a value which is a result of the yield-expression evaluation

lval

-

an lvalue which is a result of the yield-expression evaluation

g

-

a range of elements produced by a generator

r

-

a range of elements

### Return value

1) The awaitable object of type std::suspend_always.

2-5) An awaitable object of an unspecified type as described above.

### Exceptions

2,5) May throw any exception thrown by the initialization of the stored object.
