void* operator new( std::size_t size, std::allocator_arg_t,

const Alloc& alloc, const Args&... );

(2)
(since C++23)

template< class This, class Alloc, class... Args >

void* operator new( std::size_t size, const This&, std::allocator_arg_t,

const Alloc& alloc, const Args&... );

(3)
(since C++23)

Allocates size bytes of uninitialized storage using default or user-provided allocator.

Let A be

- Allocator, if it is not void,

- Alloc for (2,3), or

- std::allocator<void> otherwise.

Let B be std::allocator_traits<A>::template rebind_alloc<U> where U is an unspecified type whose size and alignment are both __STDCPP_DEFAULT_NEW_ALIGNMENT__.

Initializes an allocator b of type B with:

1) A(),

2,3) A(alloc).

Uses b to allocate storage for the smallest array of U sufficient to provide storage for a coroutine state of size size, and unspecified additional state necessary to ensure that operator delete can later deallocate this memory block with an allocator equal to b.

The program is ill-formed unless std::allocator_traits<B>::pointer is a pointer type and for overloads (2,3), std::same_as<Allocator, void> | std::convertible_to<const Alloc&, Allocator> is modeled.

### Parameters

size

-

the size of the storage to allocate

alloc

-

a user provided allocator of type Alloc

### Return value

A pointer to the allocated storage.

### Exceptions

1-3) May throw.
