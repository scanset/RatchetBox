auto final_suspend() noexcept;

(since C++23)

Let x be some generator object. final_suspend does the following:

- Pops the coroutine handle from the top of *active_.

- If *x.active_ is not empty, resumes execution of the coroutine referred to by x.active_->top(). If it is empty, control flow returns to the current coroutine caller or resumer.

A handle referring to the coroutine whose promise object is *this must be at the top of *x.active_ of x. This function must be called by the coroutine upon reaching its final suspend point. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

### Return value

An awaitable object of unspecified type whose member functions are configured to suspend the calling coroutine.
