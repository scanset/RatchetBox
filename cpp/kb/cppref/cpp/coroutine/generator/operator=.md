generator& operator=( generator other ) noexcept;

(since C++23)

Replaces the contents of the generator object. Equivalent to:

std::swap(coroutine_, other.coroutine_);

std::swap(active_, other.active_);

### Parameters

other

-

another generator to be moved from

### Return value

### Complexity

### Notes

Iterators previously obtained from other are not invalidated – they become iterators into *this.

This assignment operator is technically a copy assignment operator, although std::generator is only move assignable.
