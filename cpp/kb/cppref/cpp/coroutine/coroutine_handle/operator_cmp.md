Defined in header <coroutine>

constexpr bool

    operator==( std::coroutine_handle<> x, std::coroutine_handle<> y ) noexcept;

(1)
(since C++20)

constexpr std::strong_ordering

    operator<=>( std::coroutine_handle<> x, std::coroutine_handle<> y ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++20)

Compares two std::coroutine_handle<> values x and y according to their underlying addresses.

The <, <=, >, >=, and != operators are synthesized from operator<=> and operator== respectively.

### Parameters

x, y

-

std::coroutine_handle<> values to compare

### Return value

1) x.address() == y.address()

2) std::compare_three_way{}(x.address(), y.address())

### Notes

Although these operators are only overloaded for std::coroutine_handle<>, other specializations of std::coroutine_handle are also equality comparable and three-way comparable, because they are implicitly convertible to std::coroutine_handle<>.
