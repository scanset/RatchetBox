Member of specialization std::coroutine_handle<std::noop_coroutine_promise>

constexpr bool done() const noexcept;

(2)
(since C++20)

Checks if a suspended coroutine is suspended at its final suspend point.

1) Returns true if the coroutine to which *this refers is suspended at its final suspend point, or false if the coroutine is suspended at other suspend points. The behavior is undefined if *this does not refer to a suspended coroutine.

2) Always returns false.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

1) true if the coroutine is suspended at its final suspend point, false if the coroutine is suspended at other suspend points.

2) false

### Notes

A no-op coroutine is never considered to be suspended at its final suspend point.

A coroutine with promise object p is considered to be suspended at its final suspend point only if, let e be the result of p.final_suspend(), e.await_ready() returns false. In particular, if p.final_suspend() returns std::suspend_never, then done() never returns true.
