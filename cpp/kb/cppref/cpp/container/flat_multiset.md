(since C++23)

The flat multiset is a container adaptor that gives the functionality of an associative container that stores a sorted set of objects of type Key. Unlike std::flat_set, multiple keys with equivalent values are allowed. Sorting is done using the key comparison function Compare.

The class template flat_multiset acts as a wrapper to the underlying sorted container passed as object of type KeyContainer.

Everywhere the standard library uses the Compare requirements, uniqueness is determined by using the equivalence relation. Informally, two objects a and b are considered equivalent if neither compares less than the other: !comp(a, b) && !comp(b, a).

std::flat_multiset meets the requirements of Container, ReversibleContainer, optional container requirements, and all requirements of AssociativeContainer (including logarithmic search complexity), except that:

- requirements related to nodes are not applicable,

- iterator invalidation requirements differ, 

- the complexity of insertion and erasure operations is linear.

A flat multiset supports most AssociativeContainer's operations that use equal keys.

### Iterator invalidation

This section is incomplete

### Template parameters

Key

-

The type of the stored elements. The program is ill-formed if Key is not the same type as KeyContainer::value_type.

Compare

-

A Compare type providing a strict weak ordering.

KeyContainer

-

The type of the underlying SequenceContainer to store the elements. The iterators of such container should satisfy LegacyRandomAccessIterator or model random_access_iterator.
The standard containers std::vector and std::deque satisfy these requirements.

(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator<=>

(C++23)

lexicographically compares the values of two flat_multisets 
(function template)

std::swap(std::flat_multiset)

(C++23)

specializes the std::swap algorithm 
(function template)

erase_if(std::flat_multiset)

(C++23)

erases all elements satisfying specific criteria 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::uses_allocator<std::flat_multiset>

(C++23)

specializes the std::uses_allocator type trait 
(class template specialization)

### Tags

sorted_equivalentsorted_equivalent_t

(C++23)

indicates that elements of a range are sorted (uniqueness is not required)
(tag)

### Deduction guides

### Notes

The member types iterator and const_iterator may be aliases to the same type. This means defining a pair of function overloads using the two types as parameter types may violate the One Definition Rule. Since iterator is convertible to const_iterator, a single function with a const_iterator as parameter type will work instead.
