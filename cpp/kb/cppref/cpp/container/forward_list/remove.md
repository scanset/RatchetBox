(until C++20)

template< class UnaryPredicate >

size_type remove_if( UnaryPredicate p );

(since C++20)

Removes all elements satisfying specific criteria. Invalidates only the iterators and references to the removed elements.

1) Removes all elements that are equal to value (using operator==).

2) Removes all elements for which predicate p returns true.

### Parameters

value

-

value of the elements to remove

p

-

unary predicate which returns ​true if the element should be removed. 

The expression p(v) must be convertible to bool for every argument v of type (possibly const) T, regardless of value category, and must not modify v. Thus, a parameter type of T&is not allowed, nor is T unless for T a move is equivalent to a copy(since C++11).
​

Type requirements

-

UnaryPredicate must meet the requirements of Predicate.

### Return value

(none)

(until C++20)

The number of elements removed.

(since C++20)

### Complexity

Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as std::distance(begin(), end()):

1) Exactly \(\scriptsize N\)N comparisons using operator==.

2) Exactly \(\scriptsize N\)N applications of the predicate p.

### Example

Run this code

#include <forward_list>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::forward_list<int> l = {1, 100, 2, 3, 10, 1, 11, -1, 12};
 
auto count1 = l.remove(1);
std::cout << count1 << " elements equal to 1 were removed\n";
 
auto count2 = l.remove_if([](int n){ return n > 10; });
std::cout << count2 << " elements greater than 10 were removed\n";
 
std::cout << "Finally, the list contains: ";
for (int n : l)
std::cout << n << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

2 elements equal to 1 were removed
3 elements greater than 10 were removed
Finally, the list contains: 2 3 10 -1
