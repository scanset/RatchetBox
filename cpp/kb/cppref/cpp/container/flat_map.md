(since C++23)

The flat map is a container adaptor that gives the functionality of an associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys. Keys are sorted by using the comparison function Compare.

The class template flat_map acts as a wrapper to the two underlying containers, passed as objects of type KeyContainer and MappedContainer respectively. The first container is sorted, and for each key its corresponding value is in the second container at the same index (offset). The number of elements in both containers is the same.

Everywhere the standard library uses the Compare requirements, uniqueness is determined by using the equivalence relation. Informally, two objects a and b are considered equivalent if neither compares less than the other: !comp(a, b) && !comp(b, a).

std::flat_map meets the requirements of Container, ReversibleContainer, optional container requirements, and all requirements of AssociativeContainer (including logarithmic search complexity), except that:

- requirements related to nodes are not applicable,

- iterator invalidation requirements differ, 

- the complexity of insertion and erasure operations is linear.

A flat map supports most AssociativeContainer's operations that use unique keys.

### Iterator invalidation

This section is incomplete

### Template parameters

Key

-

The type of the keys. The program is ill-formed if Key is not the same type as KeyContainer::value_type.

T

-

The type of mapped values. The program is ill-formed if T is not the same type as MappedContainer::value_type.

Compare

-

A Compare type providing a strict weak ordering.

KeyContainer
MappedContainer

-

The types of the underlying SequenceContainer to store keys and mapped values correspondingly. The iterators of such containers should satisfy LegacyRandomAccessIterator or model random_access_iterator. Invocations of their member functions size and max_size should not exit via an exception.
The standard containers std::vector and std::deque satisfy these requirements.

(function template)

erase_if(std::flat_map)

erases all elements satisfying specific criteria 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::uses_allocator<std::flat_map>

specializes the std::uses_allocator type trait 
(class template specialization)

### Tags

sorted_uniquesorted_unique_t

(C++23)

indicates that elements of a range are sorted and unique
(tag)

### Deduction guides

### Notes

The member types iterator and const_iterator may be aliases to the same type. This means defining a pair of function overloads using the two types as parameter types may violate the One Definition Rule. Since iterator is convertible to const_iterator, a single function with a const_iterator as parameter type will work instead.
