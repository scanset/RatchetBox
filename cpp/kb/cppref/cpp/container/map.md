(since C++17)

std::map is a sorted associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys. Keys are sorted by using the comparison function Compare. Search, removal, and insertion operations have logarithmic complexity. Maps are usually implemented as Red–black trees.

Iterators of std::map iterate in ascending order of keys, where ascending is defined by the comparison that was used for construction. That is, given

- m, a std::map

- it_l and it_r, dereferenceable iterators to m, with it_l < it_r.

m.value_comp()(*it_l, *it_r) == true (least to greatest if using the default comparison).

Everywhere the standard library uses the Compare requirements, uniqueness is determined by using the equivalence relation. In imprecise terms, two objects a and b are considered equivalent (not unique) if neither compares less than the other: !comp(a, b) && !comp(b, a).

std::map meets the requirements of Container, AllocatorAwareContainer, AssociativeContainer and ReversibleContainer.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>
 
void print_map(std::string_view comment, const std::map<std::string, int>& m)
{
std::cout << comment;
// Iterate using C++17 facilities
for (const auto& [key, value] : m)
std::cout << '[' << key << "] = " << value << "; ";
 
// C++11 alternative:
// for (const auto& n : m)
// std::cout << n.first << " = " << n.second << "; ";
//
// C++98 alternative:
// for (std::map<std::string, int>::const_iterator it = m.begin(); it != m.end(); ++it)
// std::cout << it->first << " = " << it->second << "; ";
 
std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
// Create a map of three (string, int) pairs
std::map<std::string, int> m{{"CPU", 10}, {"GPU", 15}, {"RAM", 20}};
 
print_map("1) Initial map: ", m);
 
m["CPU"] = 25; // update an existing value
m["SSD"] = 30; // insert a new value
print_map("2) Updated map: ", m);
 
// Using operator[] with non-existent key always performs an insert
std::cout << "3) m[UPS] = " << m["UPS"] << '\n';
print_map("4) Updated map: ", m);
 
m.erase("GPU");
print_map("5) After erase: ", m);
 
std::erase_if(m, [](const auto& pair){ return pair.second > 25; });
print_map("6) After erase: ", m);
std::cout << "7) m.size() = " << m.size() << '\n';
 
m.clear();
std::cout << std::boolalpha << "8) Map is empty: " << m.empty() << '\n';
}

Output:

1) Initial map: [CPU] = 10; [GPU] = 15; [RAM] = 20;
2) Updated map: [CPU] = 25; [GPU] = 15; [RAM] = 20; [SSD] = 30;
3) m[UPS] = 0
4) Updated map: [CPU] = 25; [GPU] = 15; [RAM] = 20; [SSD] = 30; [UPS] = 0;
5) After erase: [CPU] = 25; [RAM] = 20; [SSD] = 30; [UPS] = 0;
6) After erase: [CPU] = 25; [RAM] = 20; [UPS] = 0;
7) m.size() = 3
8) Map is empty: true
