Defined in header <queue>

template<

    class T,

    class Container = std::deque<T>

> class queue;

The std::queue class template is a container adaptor that gives the functionality of a queue - specifically, a FIFO (first-in, first-out) data structure.

The class template acts as a wrapper to the underlying container - only a specific set of functions is provided. The queue pushes the elements on the back of the underlying container and pops them from the front.

### Template parameters

T

-

The type of the stored elements. The program is ill-formed if T is not the same type as Container::value_type.

Container

-

The type of the underlying container to use to store the elements. The container must satisfy the requirements of SequenceContainer. Additionally, it must provide the following functions with the usual semantics:

- back(), e.g., std::deque::back(),

- front(), e.g. std::list::front(),

- push_back(), e.g., std::deque::push_back(),

- pop_front(), e.g., std::list::pop_front().

The standard containers std::deque and std::list satisfy these requirements.

### Member objects

(protected member object)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs the queue 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destructs the queue 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns values to the container adaptor 
(public member function)

#### Element access 

front

access the first element 
(public member function)

back

access the last element 
(public member function)

#### Capacity 

empty

checks whether the container adaptor is empty 
(public member function)

size

returns the number of elements 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

push

inserts element at the end 
(public member function)

push_range

(C++23)

inserts a range of elements at the end 
(public member function)

emplace

(C++11)

constructs element in-place at the end 
(public member function)

pop

removes the first element 
(public member function)

swap

(C++11)

swaps the contents 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator!=operator<operator<=operator>operator>=operator<=>

(C++20)

lexicographically compares the values of two queues 
(function template)

std::swap(std::queue)

(C++11)

specializes the std::swap algorithm 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::uses_allocator<std::queue>

(C++11)

specializes the std::uses_allocator type trait 
(class template specialization)

std::formatter<std::queue>

(C++23)

formatting support for std::queue 
(class template specialization)

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
 
int main()
{
std::queue<int> q;
 
q.push(0); // back pushes 0
q.push(1); // q = 0 1
q.push(2); // q = 0 1 2
q.push(3); // q = 0 1 2 3
 
assert(q.front() == 0);
assert(q.back() == 3);
assert(q.size() == 4);
 
q.pop(); // removes the front element, 0
assert(q.size() == 3);
 
// Print and remove all elements. Note that std::queue does not
// support begin()/end(), so a range-for-loop cannot be used.
std::cout << "q: ";
for (; !q.empty(); q.pop())
std::cout << q.front() << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
assert(q.size() == 0);
}

Output:

q: 1 2 3

std::queue did not support containers using proxy

LWG 2566

C++98

Missing the requirement for Container::value_type

ill-formed if T is not the same type as Container::value_type

- ↑ Such as containers similar to std::vector<bool> with additional support of pop_front(). The resolution of this DR
added support of std::vector<bool> for std::stack and std::priority_queue. The changes involving std::queue
are for maintaining consistency.
