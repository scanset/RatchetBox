template< class... Integrals >

explicit extents( Integrals... ) -> /* see below */;

(since C++23)

A deduction guide is provided for std::extents to allow deduction from integral arguments.

The deduced type is equivalent to 

std::dextents<std::size_t, sizeof...(Integrals)>

(until C++26)

std::extents<std::size_t, maybe-static-ext ﻿<Integrals>...>

(since C++26)

This overload participates in overload resolution only if (std::is_convertible_v<Integrals, std::size_t> && ...) is true.
