template< class IndexType, std::size_t... Extents >

class extents;

(1)
(since C++23)

template< class IndexType, std::size_t Rank >

using dextents = /* see below */

(2)
(since C++23)

template< std::size_t Rank, class IndexType = std::size_t >

using dims = std::dextents<IndexType, Rank>;

(3)
(since C++26)

1) Represents a multidimensional index space of rank equal to sizeof...(Extents). 

2) A convenient alias template for an all-dynamic extents. Let d denote std::dynamic_extent, each specialization of it dextents<IndexType, Rank> is equivalent to extents<IndexType /*, d, d, ..., d*/> (i.e. d is repeated a total of Rank times).

3) A convenient alias template for an all-dynamic extents with std::size_t as the default index type.

Each specialization of extents models regular and is TriviallyCopyable.

### Template parameters

IndexType

-

the type of each non-dynamic Extents. Shall be a signed or unsigned integer type. Otherwise, the program is ill-formed

Extents

-

represents extent (size of an integer interval) for each rank index. Each element of it is either equal to std::dynamic_extent (in this case, it represents a dynamic extent and the extent size will be determined dynamically), or is representable as a value of type IndexType (then it represents a static extent and the extent size is just the value of it), or else the program is ill-formed

Rank

-

denotes the rank of an all-dynamic extents

Definition

std::array<index_type, rank_dynamic()> dynamic-extents (private)

An array which stores the size of each dynamic extents.
