template< class OtherMapping >

friend constexpr bool operator==( const mapping& lhs, 

const OtherMapping& rhs ) noexcept;

(since C++23)

Compares two layout mappings of possibly different layout types based on their underlying extents and strides. 

Layout mappings lhs and rhs compare equal if all of the following conditions are true:

- both lhs.extents() and rhs.extents() are equal,

- OFFSET(rhs) is equal to ​0​, and

- for every rank index r in the range [​0​, lhs.extents().rank()), lhs.stride(r) is equal to rhs.stride(r)

Where OFFSET(rhs) is equal to:

- rhs(), if rhs.extents().rank() is ​0​,

- otherwise ​0​, if the size of the multidimensional index space rhs.extents() is ​0​,

- otherwise rhs(z...) for a pack of integers z that is a multidimensional index in rhs.extents() and each element of z is equal to ​0​.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if all of the following constraints are satisfied:

- layout-mapping-alike <OtherMapping> is satisfied,

- rank_ == OtherMapping::extents_type::rank() is true, and

- OtherMapping::is_always_strided() is true

(rank_ is an exposition-only static member constant defined in std::layout_stride::mapping.)

If OtherMapping does not meet the LayoutMapping requirements, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

-

layout mappings whose extents and strides to compare

### Return value
