template< std::size_t PaddingValue = std::dynamic_extent >

struct layout_left_padded;

(since C++26)

Every specialization of layout_left_padded is a LayoutMappingPolicy which provides a layout mapping that is similar to layout_left::mapping except that it has a padding stride.

Every specialization of layout_left_padded is TriviallyCopyable, and std::is_trivially_default_constructible_v<T> is true for any such specialization T.

Let m be the instance of the mapping type layout_left_padded::mapping. The padding stride of the mapping is the second stride m.stride(1) which is guaranteed to be at least the first extent value m.extent(0), called extent to pad.
