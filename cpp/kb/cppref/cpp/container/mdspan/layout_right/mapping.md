template< class Extents >

class layout_right::mapping;

(since C++23)

The class template layout_right::mapping controls how multidimensional indices are mapped in a row-major manner to a one-dimensional value representing the offset. The mapping has stride 1 at rightmost extent and strides increase right-to-left as the products of extents.

Every specialization of mapping is a LayoutMapping and a TriviallyCopyable type which satisfies regular.

The program is ill-formed if the size of the multidimensional index space Extents() is not representable as a value of type Extents::index_type when Extents::rank_dynamic() is ​0​.

### Template parameters

Extents

specifies number of dimensions, their sizes, and which are known at compile time. Must be a specialization of std::extents.

### Data members

Member

Definition

extents_type extents_ (private)

the extents object
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new mapping 
(public member function)

operator=

(explicitly defaulted)

assigns a mapping 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

extents

obtains the extents object 
(public member function)

required_span_size

returns the required size of the mapping 
(public member function)

operator()

maps a multidimensional index into an offset value 
(public member function)

is_unique

[static]

determines if this mapping is unique (every combination of indices maps to a different underlying element) 
(public static member function)

is_exhaustive

[static]

determines if this mapping is exhaustive (every underlying element can be accessed with some combination of indices) 
(public static member function)

is_strided

[static]

determines if this mapping is strided (in each dimension, incrementing an index jumps over the same number of underlying elements every time) 
(public static member function)

is_always_unique

[static]

determines if this layout mapping is always unique 
(public static member function)

is_always_exhaustive

[static]

determines if this layout mapping is always exhaustive 
(public static member function)

is_always_strided

[static]

determines if this layout mapping is always strided 
(public static member function)

stride

obtains the stride along the specified dimension 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==

compares this layout mapping of layout_right with other mapping 
(function template)

submdspan_mapping(std::layout_right::mapping)

(C++26)

calculates the mapping and data handle offset used for subdmspan 
(public member function)
