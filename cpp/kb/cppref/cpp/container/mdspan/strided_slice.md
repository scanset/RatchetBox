Defined in header <mdspan>

template< class OffsetType, class ExtentType, class StrideType >

struct strided_slice;

(since C++26)

An instance of every specialization of strided_slice is a slice specifier used in std::submdspan to select a subset of elements using a set of regularly spaced indices at a specified dimension in std::mdspan. 

Each strided_slice object s is characterized by three data members: the offset index s.offset, the extent s.extent, and the stride s.stride.

Given that s.stride is greater than zero, the number of selected indices denoted by N is determined by 1 + (s.extent - 1) / s.stride if s.extent is nonzero, otherwise ​0​. The half-open interval from which indices will be selected is given by [s.offset, s.offset + s.extent). The sequence of selected indices is produced as follows: s.offset, ..., s.offset + (N - 1) * s.stride.

This class template has no base classes or declared members other than those shown below.

### Template parameters

OffsetType

-

the type of offset

ExtentType

-

the type of extent

StrideType

-

the type of stride

Type requirements

-

All template parameters must be unsigned or signed integer types or must satisfy integral-constant-like

The program is ill-formed if the type requirement is not satisfied.

### Member types

Member type

Definition

offset_type

OffsetType

extent_type

ExtentType

stride_type

StrideType

### Data members

Member name

Definition

offset

a starting index of type offset_type 
(public member object)

extent

a value of type extent_type added to offset used to define the upper bound of indices 
(public member object)

stride

an increment value of type stride_type which is equivalent to the distance between two indices 
(public member object)

All these members are declared with [[no_unique_address]] attribute and have default member initializers where each data member is value initialized.

### Notes

Every specialization of strided_slice is an aggregate class which allows aggregate initialization (including designated initialization) of data members (for instance, std::strided_slice{.offset = 2, .extent = 10, .stride = 3}).

The slice specification of strided_slice takes advantage of the data member extent, as opposed to other slice specifications that use end to indicate the upper bound value. This is because it can directly generate a static extent for subview of std::mdspan if both extent and stride are of types that satisfy integral-constant-like. This enables efficient extraction of subviews with static extents by mixing compile time values with a runtime value of offset.

### Example

Run this code

#include <mdspan>
#include <print>
 
template <typename View, typename O = int, typename E = int, typename S = int>
requires (View::extents_type::rank() == 1)
void print_sliced_view(View v, std::strided_slice<O, E, S> s)
{
using index_type = View::index_type;
auto subview = std::submdspan(v, s);
const auto& submap = subview.mapping();
 
std::print("[");
bool uses_comma = false;
for (index_type i = 0; i != subview.extent(0); ++i)
{
if (uses_comma)
std::print(", ");
std::print("{}", subview[i]);
uses_comma = true;
}
uses_comma = false;
std::print("] extracted from indices [");
for (index_type i = 0; i != subview.extent(0); ++i)
{
if (uses_comma)
std::print(", ");
std::print("{}", submap(i) + s.offset);
uses_comma = true;
}
std::println("]");
}
 
int main()
{
static constexpr char letters[]
{
'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J',
'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T',
'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z'
};
constexpr std::mdspan md(letters, 26);
print_sliced_view(md, {.offset = 0, .extent = 10, .stride = 1});
print_sliced_view(md, {.offset = 2, .extent = 10, .stride = 1});
print_sliced_view(md, {.offset = 0, .extent = 5, .stride = 1});
print_sliced_view(md, {.offset = 2, .extent = 5, .stride = 1});
print_sliced_view(md, {.offset = 0, .extent = 10, .stride = 2});
print_sliced_view(md, {.offset = 2, .extent = 10, .stride = 3});
print_sliced_view(md, {.offset = 0, .extent = 15, .stride = 5});
print_sliced_view(md, {.offset = 6, .extent = 15, .stride = 5});
}

Output:

[A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J] extracted from indices [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
[C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L] extracted from indices [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
[A, B, C, D, E] extracted from indices [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
[C, D, E, F, G] extracted from indices [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[A, C, E, G, I] extracted from indices [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
[C, F, I, L] extracted from indices [2, 5, 8, 11]
[A, F, K] extracted from indices [0, 5, 10]
[G, L, Q] extracted from indices [6, 11, 16]
