struct layout_left;

(since C++23)

layout_left is a LayoutMappingPolicy which provides a layout mapping where the leftmost extent has stride 1, and strides increase left-to-right as the product of extents.

layout_left is a TrivialType.

(until C++26)

layout_left is TriviallyCopyable, and std::is_trivially_default_constructible_v<layout_left> is true.

(since C++26)
