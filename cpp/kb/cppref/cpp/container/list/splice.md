void splice( const_iterator pos, list& other );

(1)

void splice( const_iterator pos, list&& other );

(2)
(since C++11)

void splice( const_iterator pos, list& other, const_iterator it );

(3)

void splice( const_iterator pos, list&& other, const_iterator it );

(4)
(since C++11)

void splice( const_iterator pos, list& other, 

             const_iterator first, const_iterator last);

(5)

void splice( const_iterator pos, list&& other, 

             const_iterator first, const_iterator last );

(since C++11)

Transfers elements from one list to another.

No elements are copied or moved, only the internal pointers of the list nodes are re-pointed. No iterators or references become invalidated, the iterators to moved elements remain valid, but now refer into *this, not into other.

1,2) Transfers all elements from other into *this. The elements are inserted before the element pointed to by pos. The container other becomes empty after the operation.

3,4) Transfers the element pointed to by it from other into *this. The element is inserted before the element pointed to by pos.

5,6) Transfers the elements in the range [first, last) from other into *this. The elements are inserted before the element pointed to by pos.

The behavior is undefined if

- get_allocator() != other.get_allocator(),

- for overloads (1,2), *this and other refer to the same object,

- for overloads (3,4), it is not a dereferenceable iterator into other, or

- for overloads (5,6),

- [first, last) is not a valid range in other, or

- pos is in [first, last).

### Parameters

pos

-

element before which the content will be inserted

other

-

another container to transfer the content from

it

-

the element to transfer from other to *this

first, last

-

the range of elements to transfer from other to *this

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

Throws nothing.

### Complexity

1-4) Constant.

5,6) Constant if other refers to the same object as *this, otherwise linear in std::distance(first, last).

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <list>
 
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& ostr, const std::list<int>& list)
{
for (auto& i : list)
ostr << ' ' << i;
 
return ostr;
}
 
int main ()
{
std::list<int> list1{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
std::list<int> list2{10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
 
auto it = list1.begin();
std::advance(it, 2);
 
list1.splice(it, list2);
 
std::cout << "list1:" << list1 << '\n';
std::cout << "list2:" << list2 << '\n';
 
list2.splice(list2.begin(), list1, it, list1.end());
 
std::cout << "list1:" << list1 << '\n';
std::cout << "list2:" << list2 << '\n';
}

Output:

list1: 1 2 10 20 30 40 50 3 4 5
list2:
list1: 1 2 10 20 30 40 50
list2: 3 4 5

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

LWG 250

C++98

references and iterators to the moved
element(s) were all invalidated

they refer or point to the
same element(s) in *this

N2525

O(1) splicing could not be guaranteed if
get_allocator() != other.get_allocator()

the behavior is
undefined in this case
