void assign( size_type count, const T& value );

(1)
(constexpr since C++20)

template< class InputIt >

void assign( InputIt first, InputIt last );

(2)
(constexpr since C++20)

void assign( std::initializer_list<T> ilist );

(3)
(since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++20)

Replaces the contents of the container.

1) Replaces the contents with count copies of value value.

2) Replaces the contents with copies of those in the range [first, last).

If either argument is an iterator into *this, the behavior is undefined.

This overload has the same effect as overload (1) if InputIt is an integral type.

(until C++11)

This overload participates in overload resolution only if InputIt satisfies LegacyInputIterator.

(since C++11)

3) Replaces the contents with the elements from ilist.

All iterators (including the end() iterator) and all references to the elements are invalidated.

### Parameters

count

-

the new size of the container

value

-

the value to initialize elements of the container with

first, last

-

the range to copy the elements from

ilist

-

std::initializer_list to copy the values from

### Complexity

1) Linear in count.

2) Linear in distance between first and last.

3) Linear in ilist.size().

### Example

The following code uses assign to add several characters to a std::vector<char>:

Run this code

#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::vector<char> characters;
 
auto print_vector = [&]()
{
for (char c : characters)
std::cout << c << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
};
 
characters.assign(5, 'a');
print_vector();
 
const std::string extra(6, 'b');
characters.assign(extra.begin(), extra.end());
print_vector();
 
characters.assign({'C', '+', '+', '1', '1'});
print_vector();
}

Output:

a a a a a
b b b b b b
C + + 1 1
