template< container-compatible-range<T> R >

constexpr iterator insert_range( const_iterator pos, R&& rg );

(since C++23)

Inserts, in non-reversing order, copies of elements in rg before pos.

If after the operation the new size() is greater than old capacity() a reallocation takes place, in which case all iterators (including the end() iterator) and all references to the elements are invalidated. Otherwise, only the iterators and references before the insertion point remain valid.

Each iterator in the range rg is dereferenced exactly once.

rg must not overlap with the container. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

pos

-

iterator before which the content will be inserted (pos may be the end() iterator)

rg

-

a container compatible range, that is, an input_range whose elements are convertible to T

Type requirements

-

T must be EmplaceConstructible into vector from *ranges::begin(rg). Also, T must be MoveInsertable into vector and T must satisfy MoveConstructible, MoveAssignable, and Swappable. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

### Return value

An iterator that points at the copy of the first element inserted into vector or at pos if rg is empty.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <iterator>
#include <vector>
#include <list>
 
int main()
{
auto container = std::vector{1, 2, 3, 4};
auto pos = std::next(container.begin(), 2);
assert(*pos == 3);
const auto rg = std::list{-1, -2, -3};
 
#ifdef __cpp_lib_containers_ranges
container.insert_range(pos, rg);
#else
container.insert(pos, rg.cbegin(), rg.cend());
#endif
assert(std::ranges::equal(container, std::vector{1, 2, -1, -2, -3, 3, 4}));
