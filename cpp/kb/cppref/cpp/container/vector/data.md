T* data();

(1)
(noexcept since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++20)

const T* data() const;

(2)
(noexcept since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++20)

Returns a pointer to the underlying array serving as element storage. The pointer is such that range [data(), data() + size()) is always a valid range, even if the container is empty (data() is not dereferenceable in that case).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Pointer to the underlying element storage. For non-empty containers, the returned pointer compares equal to the address of the first element.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

If size() is ​0​, data() may or may not return a null pointer.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
#include <span>
#include <vector>
 
void pointer_func(const int* p, std::size_t size)
{
std::cout << "data = ";
for (std::size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i)
std::cout << p[i] << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}
 
void span_func(std::span<const int> data) // since C++20
{
std::cout << "data = ";
for (const int e : data)
std::cout << e << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
std::vector<int> container{1, 2, 3, 4};
 
// Prefer container.data() over &container[0]
pointer_func(container.data(), container.size());
 
// std::span is a safer alternative to separated pointer/size.
span_func({container.data(), container.size()});
}

Output:

data = 1 2 3 4
data = 1 2 3 4
