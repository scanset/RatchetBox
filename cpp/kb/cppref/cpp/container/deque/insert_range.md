template< container-compatible-range<T> R >

iterator insert_range( const_iterator pos, R&& rg );

(since C++23)

Inserts, in non-reversing order, copies of elements in rg before pos.

All iterators (including the end() iterator) are invalidated. References are invalidated too, unless pos == begin() or pos == end(), in which case they are not invalidated.

Each iterator in the range rg is dereferenced exactly once.

rg must not overlap with the container. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

pos

-

iterator before which the content will be inserted (pos may be the end() iterator)

rg

-

a container compatible range, that is, an input_range whose elements are convertible to T

Type requirements

-

T must be EmplaceConstructible into deque from *ranges::begin(rg). Also, T must be MoveInsertable into deque and T must satisfy MoveConstructible, MoveAssignable, and Swappable. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

### Return value

An iterator that points at the copy of the first element inserted into deque or at pos if rg is empty.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <iterator>
#include <deque>
#include <list>
 
int main()
{
auto container = std::deque{1, 2, 3, 4};
auto pos = std::next(container.begin(), 2);
assert(*pos == 3);
const auto rg = std::list{-1, -2, -3};
 
#ifdef __cpp_lib_containers_ranges
container.insert_range(pos, rg);
#else
container.insert(pos, rg.cbegin(), rg.cend());
#endif
assert(std::ranges::equal(container, std::deque{1, 2, -1, -2, -3, 3, 4}));
}
