(since C++20)

Compares the contents of the underlying containers of two container adaptors. The comparison is done by applying the corresponding operator to the underlying containers. 

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

container adaptors whose contents to compare

-

T must meet the requirements of EqualityComparable.

### Return value

1-6) true if the corresponding comparison yields true, false otherwise.

7) Result of three-way comparison on underlying containers.

### Complexity

Linear in the size of the container.
