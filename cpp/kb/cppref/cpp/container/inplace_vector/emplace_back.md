template< class... Args >

constexpr reference emplace_back( Args&&... args );

(since C++26)

Appends a new element to the end of the container. Typically, the element is constructed using placement-new to construct the element in-place at the location provided by the container. The arguments args... are forwarded to the constructor as std::forward<Args>(args)....

No iterators or references are invalidated, except end(), which is invalidated if the insertion occurs.

### Parameters

args

-

arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

Type requirements

-

T must meet the requirements of EmplaceConstructible.

### Return value

back(), i.e. a reference to the inserted element.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

- std::bad_alloc if size() == capacity() before invocation.

- Any exception thrown by initialization of the inserted element.

If an exception is thrown for any reason, these functions have no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Example

Run this code

#include <inplace_vector>
#include <new>
#include <print>
#include <string>
#include <utility>
 
int main()
{
std::inplace_vector<std::pair<std::string, std::string>, 2> fauna;
std::string dog{"\N{DOG}"};
 
fauna.emplace_back("\N{CAT}", dog);
fauna.emplace_back("\N{CAT}", std::move(dog));
std::println("fauna = {}", fauna);
 
try
{
fauna.emplace_back("\N{BUG}", "\N{BUG}"); // throws: there is no space
}
catch(const std::bad_alloc& ex)
{
std::println("{}", ex.what());
}
std::println("fauna = {}", fauna);
}

Possible output:

fauna = [("🐈", "🐕"), ("🐈", "🐕")]
std::bad_alloc
fauna = [("🐈", "🐕"), ("🐈", "🐕")]
