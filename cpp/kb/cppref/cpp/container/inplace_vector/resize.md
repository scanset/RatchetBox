constexpr void resize( size_type count );

(1)
(since C++26)

constexpr void resize( size_type count, const value_type& value );

(2)
(since C++26)

Resizes the container to contain count elements, does nothing if count == size().

If the current size is greater than count, the container is reduced to its first count elements.

If the current size is less than count, then:

1) Additional default-inserted elements are appended.

2) Additional copies of value are appended.

### Parameters

count

-

new size of the container

value

-

the value to initialize the new elements with

Type requirements

-

T must meet the requirements of DefaultInsertable in order to use overload (1).

-

T must meet the requirements of CopyInsertable in order to use overload (2).

### Complexity

Linear in the difference between the current size and count. 

### Exceptions

1,2) Throws std::bad_alloc if count > N.

If an exception is thrown for any reason, these functions have no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Example

Run this code

#include <inplace_vector>
#include <print>
 
int main()
{
std::inplace_vector<int, 6> v(6, 9);
std::println("Initially, v = {}", v);
 
v.resize(2);
std::println("After resize(2), v = {}", v);
 
v.resize(4);
std::println("After resize(4), v = {}", v);
 
v.resize(6, -1);
std::println("After resize(6, -1), v = {}", v);
 
try
{
std::print("Trying resize(13): ");
v.resize(13); // throws, because count > N; v is left unchanged
}
catch(const std::bad_alloc& ex)
{
std::println("ex.what(): {}", ex.what());
}
std::println("After exception, v = {}", v);
}

Possible output:

Initially, v = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
After resize(2), v = [9, 9]
After resize(4), v = [9, 9, 0, 0]
After resize(6, -1), v = [9, 9, 0, 0, -1, -1]
Trying resize(13): ex.what(): std::bad_alloc
After exception, v = [9, 9, 0, 0, -1, -1]
