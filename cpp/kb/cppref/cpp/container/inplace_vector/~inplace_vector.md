constexpr ~inplace_vector();

(since C++26)

A destructor. Also, a trivial destructor if std::is_trivially_destructible_v<T> is true.
Destructs the inplace_vector. The destructors of the elements are called and the used storage is deallocated. Note, that if the elements are pointers, the pointed-to objects are not destroyed.

### Complexity

Linear in the size of the inplace_vector.
