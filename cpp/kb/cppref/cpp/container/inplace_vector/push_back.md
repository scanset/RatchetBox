constexpr reference push_back( const T& value );

(1)
(since C++26)

constexpr reference push_back( T&& value );

(2)
(since C++26)

Appends the given element value to the end of the container.

1) The new element is initialized as a copy of value.

2) value is moved into the new element.

No iterators or references are invalidated, except end(), which is invalidated if the insertion occurs.

### Parameters

value

-

the value of the element to append

Type requirements

-

T must meet the requirements of CopyInsertable in order to use overload (1).

-

T must meet the requirements of MoveInsertable in order to use overload (2).

### Return value

back(), i.e. a reference to the inserted element.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

- std::bad_alloc if size() == capacity() before invocation.

- Any exception thrown by initialization of inserted element.

If an exception is thrown for any reason, these functions have no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Example

Run this code

#include <inplace_vector>
#include <new>
#include <print>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::inplace_vector<std::string, 2> fauna;
std::string dog{"\N{DOG}"};
 
fauna.push_back("\N{CAT}"); // overload (1)
fauna.push_back(std::move(dog)); // overload (2)
std::println("fauna = {}", fauna);
 
try
{
fauna.push_back("\N{BUG}"); // throws: there is no space
}
catch(const std::bad_alloc& ex)
{
std::println("{}", ex.what());
}
std::println("fauna = {}", fauna);
}

Possible output:

fauna = ["🐈", "🐕"]
std::bad_alloc
fauna = ["🐈", "🐕"]
