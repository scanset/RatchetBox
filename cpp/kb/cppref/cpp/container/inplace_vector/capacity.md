static constexpr size_type capacity() noexcept;

(since C++26)

Returns the capacity of the internal (inplace) storage. Equivalent to: return N;.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The maximum number of elements the container is able to hold.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

Because each std::inplace_vector<T, N> is a fixed-capacity container, the value returned by capacity equals N (which is also the value returned by max_size()).

### Example

Run this code

#include <inplace_vector>
 
int main()
{
constexpr std::inplace_vector<int, 4> v1;
static_assert(v1.capacity() == 4 && v1.max_size() == 4);
 
constexpr std::inplace_vector<int, 0> v2;
static_assert(v2.capacity() == 0 && v2.max_size() == 0);
}
