template< class... Args >

constexpr reference unchecked_emplace_back( Args&&... args );

(since C++26)

Appends a new element to the end of the container. Typically, the element is constructed using placement-new to construct the element in-place at the location provided by the container. The arguments args... are forwarded to the constructor as std::forward<Args>(args)....
Equivalent to return *try_emplace_back(std::forward<Args>(args)...);.

Before the call to this function size() < capacity() must be true. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

No iterators or references are invalidated, except end(), which is invalidated if the insertion occurs.

### Parameters

args

-

arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

Type requirements

-

T must be EmplaceConstructible into inplace_vector from std::forward<Args>(args)....

### Return value

back(), i.e. a reference to the inserted element.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown by initialization of inserted element. If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

Reason: Explain the purpose of this API.

### Example

Run this code

#include <inplace_vector>
#include <new>
#include <print>
#include <string>
#include <utility>
 
int main()
{
std::inplace_vector<std::pair<std::string, std::string>, 2> fauna;
std::string dog{"\N{DOG}"};
 
fauna.unchecked_emplace_back("\N{CAT}", dog);
fauna.unchecked_emplace_back("\N{CAT}", std::move(dog));
std::println("fauna = {}", fauna);
 
// fauna.unchecked_emplace_back("BUG", "BUG"); // undefined behavior: no space
}

Output:

fauna = [("🐈", "🐕"), ("🐈", "🐕")]
