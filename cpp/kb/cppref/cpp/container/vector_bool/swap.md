Defined in header <vector>

static void swap( reference x, reference y );

(constexpr since C++20)

Swaps the contents of x and y as if by bool b = x; x = y; y = b;.

### Parameters

x

-

std::vector<bool>::reference value to swap with y

y

-

std::vector<bool>::reference value to swap with x

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
 
void println(std::string_view fmt, std::vector<bool> const& vb = {})
{
for (std::cout << fmt; bool const e : vb)
std::cout << e << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
println("swap elements of the same vector:");
std::vector<bool> x{1, 0};
println("before swap, x: ", x);
x.swap(x[0], x[1]); // same as std::vector<bool>::swap(x[0], x[1]);
println("after swap, x: ", x);
 
println("swap elements of two different vectors:");
std::vector<bool> y{0, 0, 1};
println("before swap, x: ", x);
println("before swap, y: ", y);
y.swap(x[0], y[2]); // same as std::vector<bool>::swap(x[0], y[2]);
println("after swap, x: ", x);
println("after swap, y: ", y);
}

Output:

swap elements of the same vector:
before swap, x: 1 0 
after swap, x: 0 1 
swap elements of two different vectors:
before swap, x: 0 1 
before swap, y: 0 0 1 
after swap, x: 1 1 
after swap, y: 0 0 0
