Compares the contents of the underlying containers of two container adaptors. The comparison is done by applying the corresponding operator to the underlying containers. | This section is incomplete
Reason: For "flat" containers only: copy parts of Template:cpp/container/operator_cmp

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

container adaptors whose contents to compare
This section is incomplete
Reason: Add named requirements to "flat" container inner types

### Return value

1) true if the corresponding comparison yields true, false otherwise.

2) Result of three-way comparison on underlying containers.

### Complexity

1) Constant if lhs and rhs are of different size, otherwise linear in the size of the flat_multiset.

2) 
Linear in the size of the container.
