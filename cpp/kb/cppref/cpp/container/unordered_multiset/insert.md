Inserts element(s) into the container.

1,2) Inserts value.

3,4) Inserts value, using hint as a non-binding suggestion to where the search should start.

5) Inserts elements from range [first, last).

6) Inserts elements from initializer list ilist.

7) If nh is an empty node handle, does nothing. Otherwise, inserts the element owned by nh into the container and returns an iterator pointing at the inserted element. The behavior is undefined if nh is not empty and get_allocator() != nh.get_allocator().

8) If nh is an empty node handle, does nothing and returns the end iterator. Otherwise, inserts the element owned by nh into the container, and returns the iterator pointing to the element with key equivalent to nh.key(). hint is used as a non-binding suggestion to where the search should start. The behavior is undefined if nh is not empty and get_allocator() != nh.get_allocator().

If after the operation the new number of elements is greater than old max_load_factor() * bucket_count() a rehashing takes place.
If rehashing occurs (due to the insertion), all iterators are invalidated. Otherwise (no rehashing), iterators are not invalidated. If the insertion is successful, pointers and references to the element obtained while it is held in the node handle are invalidated, and pointers and references obtained to that element before it was extracted become valid.(since C++17)

### Parameters

hint

-

iterator, used as a suggestion as to where to insert the content

value

-

element value to insert

first, last

-

range of elements to insert

ilist

-

initializer list to insert the values from

nh

-

a compatible node handle

Type requirements

-

InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

### Return value

1-4) An iterator to the inserted element.

5,6) (none)

7,8) End iterator if nh was empty, iterator pointing to the inserted element otherwise.

### Exceptions

1-4) If an exception is thrown by any operation, the insertion has no effect.

### Complexity

1-4) Average case: O(1), worst case O(size()).

5,6) Average case: O(N), where N is the number of elements to insert. Worst case: O(N * size() + N).

7,8) Average case: O(1), worst case O(size()).
