### Additional basic types and macros

Defined in header <cstddef> 

size_t

unsigned integer type returned by the sizeof operator 
(typedef)

ptrdiff_t

signed integer type returned when subtracting two pointers 
(typedef)

nullptr_t

(C++11)

the type of the null pointer literal nullptr 
(typedef)

NULL

implementation-defined null pointer constant 
(macro constant)

max_align_t

(C++11)

trivial type with alignment requirement as great as any other scalar type 
(typedef)

offsetof

byte offset from the beginning of a standard-layout type to specified member 
(function macro)

byte

(C++17)

the byte type 
(enum)

Defined in header <cstdbool>(deprecated) (until C++20) 

Defined in header <stdbool.h> 

__bool_true_false_are_defined

(C++11)(deprecated)

C compatibility macro constant, expands to integer literal 1 
(macro constant)

Defined in header <cstdalign>(deprecated) (until C++20) 

Defined in header <stdalign.h> 

__alignas_is_defined

(C++11)(deprecated)

C compatibility macro constant, expands to integer literal 1

### Fixed width integer types (since C++11)

### Fixed width floating-point types (since C++23)

### Numeric limits

Defined in header <limits> 

numeric_limits

provides an interface to query properties of all fundamental numeric types 
(class template)

#### C numeric limits interface

### Runtime type identification

Defined in header <typeinfo> 

type_info

contains some type’s information, the class returned by the typeid operator 
(class)

bad_typeid

exception that is thrown if an argument in a typeid expression is null 
(class)

bad_cast

exception that is thrown by an invalid dynamic_cast expression, i.e. a cast of reference type fails 
(class)

Defined in header <typeindex> 

type_index

(C++11)

wrapper around a type_info object, that can be used as index in associative and unordered associative containers 
(class)
