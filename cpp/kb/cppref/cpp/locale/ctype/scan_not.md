Defined in header <locale>

public:

const CharT* scan_not( mask m, const CharT* beg, const CharT* end ) const;

(1)

protected:

virtual const CharT* do_scan_not( mask m, const CharT* beg, const CharT* end ) const;

(2)

1) Public member function, calls the protected virtual member function do_scan_not of the most derived class.

2) Locates the first character in the character array [beg, end) that does not satisfy the classification mask m, that is, the first character c such that is(m, c) would return false.

### Parameters

m

-

mask to search for

beg

-

pointer to the first character in an array of characters to search

end

-

one past the end pointer for the array of characters to search

### Return value

Pointer to the first character in [beg, end) that doesn't satisfy the mask, or end if no such character was found.

### Example

Run this code

#include <clocale>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
std::wcout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
auto& f = std::use_facet<std::ctype<wchar_t>>(std::wcout.getloc());
 
// skip leading whitespace
wchar_t s1[] = L" \t\t\n Кошка";
const wchar_t* p1 = f.scan_not(std::ctype_base::space, std::begin(s1), std::end(s1));
std::wcout << '\'' << p1 << "'\n";
 
// skip leading digits
wchar_t s2[] = L"123456789ネプネプ";
const wchar_t* p2 = f.scan_not(std::ctype_base::digit, std::begin(s2), std::end(s2));
std::wcout << '\'' << p2 << "'\n";
}

Output:

'Кошка'
'ネプネプ'
