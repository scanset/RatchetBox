1,2) Public member function, calls the corresponding protected virtual member function do_narrow overload of the most derived class. Overload (1) calls do_narrow(c, dflt), overload (2) calls do_narrow(beg, end, dflt, dst).

3) Converts the (possibly wide) character c to multibyte representation if the character can be represented with a single byte (for example, ASCII characters in UTF-8 encoding are single bytes). Returns dflt if such conversion does not exist.

4) For every character in the character array [beg, end), writes narrowed characters (or dflt whenever narrowing fails) to the successive locations in the character array pointed to by dst.

Narrowing is always successful and is always reversible (by calling widen()) for all characters from the basic source character set(until C++23)basic character set(since C++23).

- i.e. do_widen(do_narrow(c, 0)) == c always holds for any character c in the basic source character set(until C++23)basic character set(since C++23).

Narrowing, if successful, preserves all character classification categories known to is().

- i.e. is(m, c) | !ctc.is(m, do_narrow(c, dflt)) is always true for any named ctype category with a ctype<char> facet ctc and ctype_base::mask value m (unless do_narrow returns dflt).

Narrowing of any digit character guarantees that if the result is subtracted from the character literal '0', the difference equals the digit value of the original character.

- i.e. for any digit character c, the expression (do_narrow(c, dflt) - '0') evaluates to the digit value of the character.

### Parameters

c

-

character to convert

dflt

-

default value to produce if the conversion fails

beg

-

pointer to the first character in an array of characters to convert

end

-

one past the end pointer for the array of characters to convert

dst

-

pointer to the first element of the array of characters to fill

### Return value

1,3) Narrowed character or dflt if narrowing fails.

2,4) end

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
void try_narrow(const std::ctype<wchar_t>& f, wchar_t c)
{
char n = f.narrow(c, 0);
if (n)
std::wcout << '\'' << c << "' narrowed to " << +(unsigned char)n << '\n';
else
std::wcout << '\'' << c << "' could not be narrowed\n";
}
 
int main()
{
std::locale::global(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
std::wcout.imbue(std::locale());
std::wcout << std::hex << std::showbase << "In US English UTF-8 locale:\n";
auto& f = std::use_facet<std::ctype<wchar_t>>(std::locale());
try_narrow(f, L'A');
try_narrow(f, L'Ａ');
try_narrow(f, L'ě');
 
std::locale::global(std::locale("cs_CZ.iso88592"));
auto& f2 = std::use_facet<std::ctype<wchar_t>>(std::locale());
std::wcout << "In Czech ISO-8859-2 locale:\n";
try_narrow(f2, L'A');
try_narrow(f2, L'Ａ');
try_narrow(f2, L'ě');
}

Possible output:

In US English UTF-8 locale:
'A' narrowed to 0x41
'Ａ' could not be narrowed
'ě' could not be narrowed
In Czech ISO-8859-2 locale:
'A' narrowed to 0x41
'Ａ' could not be narrowed
'ě' narrowed to 0xec
