public:

CharT toupper( CharT c ) const;

(1)

public:

const CharT* toupper( CharT* beg, const CharT* end ) const;

(2)

protected:

virtual CharT do_toupper( CharT c ) const;

(3)

protected:

virtual const CharT* do_toupper( CharT* beg, const CharT* end ) const;

(4)

1,2) Public member function, calls the protected virtual member function do_toupper of the most derived class.

3) Converts the character c to upper case if an upper case form is defined by this locale.

4) For every character in the character array [beg, end), for which an upper case form exists, replaces the character with that upper case form.

### Parameters

c

-

character to convert

beg

-

pointer to the first character in an array of characters to convert

end

-

one past the end pointer for the array of characters to convert

### Return value

1,3) Upper case character or c if no upper case form is listed by this locale.

2,4) end

### Notes

Only 1:1 character mapping can be performed by this function, e.g. the uppercase form of 'ß' is the two-character string "SS" (with some exceptions - see «Capital ẞ»), which cannot be obtained by do_toupper.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
void try_upper(const std::ctype<wchar_t>& f, wchar_t c)
{
wchar_t up = f.toupper(c);
if (up != c)
std::wcout << "Upper case form of \'" << c << "' is " << up << '\n';
else
std::wcout << '\'' << c << "' has no upper case form\n";
}
 
int main()
{
std::locale::global(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
std::wcout.imbue(std::locale());
std::wcout << "In US English UTF-8 locale:\n";
auto& f = std::use_facet<std::ctype<wchar_t>>(std::locale());
try_upper(f, L's');
try_upper(f, L'ſ');
try_upper(f, L'δ');
try_upper(f, L'ö');
try_upper(f, L'ß');
 
std::wstring str = L"Hello, World!";
std::wcout << "Uppercase form of the string '" << str << "' is ";
f.toupper(&str[0], &str[0] + str.size());
std::wcout << '\'' << str << "'\n";
}

Output:

In US English UTF-8 locale:
Upper case form of 's' is S
Upper case form of 'ſ' is S
Upper case form of 'δ' is Δ
Upper case form of 'ö' is Ö
'ß' has no upper case form
Uppercase form of the string 'Hello, World!' is 'HELLO, WORLD!'
