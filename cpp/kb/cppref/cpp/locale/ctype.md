template< class CharT >

class ctype;

Class ctype encapsulates character classification features. All stream input operations performed through std::basic_istream<CharT> use the std::ctype<CharT> of the locale imbued in the stream to identify whitespace characters for input tokenization. Stream output operations apply std::ctype<CharT>::widen() to narrow-character arguments prior to output.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale object):

Defined in header <locale> 

std::ctype<char>

provides narrow character equivalents of the minimal "C" locale classification. This specialization uses table lookup for character classification

std::ctype<wchar_t>

provides wide character classification appropriate to the native character set

### Nested types

Definition

char_type

CharT

### Data members

Member

Description

std::locale::id id [static]

the identifier of the facet

### Member functions

(constructor)

(public member function)

(destructor)

destructs a ctype facet 
(protected member function)

is

invokes do_is 
(public member function)

scan_is

invokes do_scan_is 
(public member function)

scan_not

(public member function)

tolower

invokes do_tolower

### Example

The following example demonstrates modification of a ctype other than ctype<char> to tokenize a CSV file:

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <sstream>
 
struct csv_whitespace : std::ctype<wchar_t>
{
bool do_is(mask m, char_type c) const
{
if ((m & space) && c == L' ')
return false; // space will NOT be classified as whitespace
 
if ((m & space) && c == L',')
return true; // comma will be classified as whitespace
 
return ctype::do_is(m, c); // leave the rest to the base class
}
};
 
int main()
{
std::wstring in = L"Column 1,Column 2,Column 3\n123,456,789";
std::wstring token;
 
std::wcout << "default locale:\n";
std::wistringstream s1(in);
while (s1 >> token)
std::wcout << " " << token << '\n';
 
std::wcout << "locale with modified ctype:\n";
std::wistringstream s2(in);
csv_whitespace* my_ws = new csv_whitespace;
s2.imbue(std::locale(s2.getloc(), my_ws));
while (s2 >> token)
std::wcout << " " << token << '\n';
}

Output:

default locale:
Column
1,Column
2,Column
3
123,456,789
locale with modified ctype:
Column 1
Column 2
Column 3
123
456
789
