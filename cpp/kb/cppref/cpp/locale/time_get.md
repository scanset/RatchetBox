> class time_get;

Class template std::time_get encapsulates date and time parsing rules. The I/O manipulator std::get_time uses the std::time_get facet of the I/O stream's locale to convert text input to a std::tm object.

Inheritance diagram

If a std::time_get specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by the standard library (see below), the behaviors of its member functions (except the constructor and destructor) are not guaranteed as specified.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale object):

Defined in header <locale> 

std::time_get<char>

parses narrow string representations of date and time

std::time_get<wchar_t>

parses wide string representations of date and time

In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every specialization that satisfies the following type requirements:

- CharT is one of char and wchar_t, and

- InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

Description

std::locale::id id [static]

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new time_get facet 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destructs a time_get facet 
(protected member function)

date_order

invokes do_date_order 
(public member function)

get_time

invokes do_get_time 
(public member function)

get_date

invokes do_get_date 
(public member function)

get_weekday

invokes do_get_weekday 
(public member function)

get_monthname

invokes do_get_monthname 
(public member function)

get_year

invokes do_get_year 
(public member function)

get

(C++11)

invokes do_get 
(public member function)

### Protected member functions

do_date_order

[virtual]

obtains preferred ordering of day, month, and year 
(virtual protected member function)

do_get_time

[virtual]

extracts hours, minutes, and seconds from input stream 
(virtual protected member function)

do_get_date

[virtual]

extracts month, day, and year from input stream 
(virtual protected member function)

do_get_weekday

[virtual]

extracts the name of a day of the week from input stream 
(virtual protected member function)

do_get_monthname

[virtual]

extracts a month name from input stream 
(virtual protected member function)

do_get_year

[virtual]

extracts a year from input stream 
(virtual protected member function)

do_get

[virtual] (C++11)

extracts date/time components from input stream, according to the specified format 
(virtual protected member function)

## Inherited from std::time_base

dateorder

date order enumeration type, defining the values no_order, dmy, mdy, ymd, and ydm

### Example

Note: choose clang to observe the output. libstdc++ does not correctly implement the %b specifier: bug 78714.

Run this code

#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
std::tm t = {};
std::istringstream ss("2011-Februar-18 23:12:34");
ss.imbue(std::locale("de_DE.utf-8"));
 
ss >> std::get_time(&t, "%Y-%b-%d %H:%M:%S");
if (ss.fail())
std::cout << "Parse failed\n";
else
std::cout << std::put_time(&t, "%c") << '\n';
}

Possible output:

Sun Feb 18 23:12:34 2011
