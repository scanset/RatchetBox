Defined in header <locale>

class locale::id;

The class std::locale::id provides implementation-specific identification of a locale facet. Each facet has a public static member named id of type std::locale::id and each std::locale object maintains a list of facets it implements, indexed by their ids.

Facets with the same id belong to the same facet category and replace each other when added to a locale object.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new id 
(public member function)

operator=

copy assignment operator is deleted 
(public member function)

### Example

The following example shows how to construct a minimal custom facet.

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
struct myfacet : std::locale::facet
{
myfacet(std::size_t refs = 0) : facet(refs) {}
static ::std::locale::id id;
};
 
std::locale::id myfacet::id;
 
int main()
{
std::locale myloc(std::locale(), new myfacet);
std::cout << "has_facet<myfacet>(myloc) returns " << std::boolalpha
<< std::has_facet<myfacet>(myloc) << '\n';
}

Output:

has_facet<myfacet>(myloc) returns true
