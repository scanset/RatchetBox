Constructs a new locale object.

1) Default constructor. Constructs a copy of the global C++ locale, which is the locale most recently used as the argument to std::locale::global or a copy of std::locale::classic() if no call to std::locale::global has been made.

2) Copy constructor. Constructs a copy of other.

3,4) Constructs a copy of the system locale with specified std_name (such as "C", or "POSIX", or "en_US.UTF-8", or "English_US.1251"), if such locale is supported by the operating system. The locale constructed in this manner has a name.

4) Equivalent to locale(std_name.c_str()).

5) Constructs a copy of other except for all the facets identified by the cats argument, which are copied from the system locale identified by its std_name. The locale constructed in this manner has a name if and only if other has a name.

6) Equivalent to locale(other, std_name.c_str(), cats).

7) Constructs a copy of other except for the facet of type Facet (typically deduced from the type of the argument) which is installed from f. If f is a null pointer, the constructed locale is a full copy of other. The program is ill-formed if Facet is not a facet or it is a volatile-qualified facet.

If f is null, the constructed locale has the same name as other. Otherwise, the constructed locale has no name.

8) Constructs a copy of other except for all the facets identified by the cats argument, which are copied from one.

If cats is equal to locale::none, the constructed locale has a name if and only if other has a name. Otherwise, the constructed locale has a name if and only if other and one both have names.

### Parameters

other

-

another locale to copy

std_name

-

name of the system locale to use

f

-

pointer to a facet to merge with other

cats

-

the facet categories used to identify the facets to merge with other

one

-

another locale to take facets from

### Exceptions

3,5) std::runtime_error if the operating system has no locale named std_name or if std_name is a null pointer.

4,6) std::runtime_error if the operating system has no locale named std_name.

### Notes

Overload (7) is typically called with its second argument, f, obtained directly from a new-expression: the locale is responsible for calling the matching delete from its own destructor.

### Example

Run this code

#include <codecvt>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os, const std::locale& loc)
{
if (loc.name().length() <= 80)
os << loc.name();
else
for (const auto c : loc.name())
os << c << (c == ';' ? "\n " : "");
 
return os << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
std::locale l1;
std::cout << "Name of a copy of the classic \"C\" locale: " << l1;
 
std::locale l2("en_US.UTF-8");
std::cout << "Name of unicode locale: " << l2;
 
std::locale l3(l1, new std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t>);
std::cout << "Name of \"C\" locale except for codecvt: " << l3;
 
std::locale l4(l1, l2, std::locale::ctype);
std::cout << "Name of \"C\" locale except for ctype, which is unicode:\n " << l4;
}

Possible output:

Name of a copy of the classic "C" locale: C
Name of unicode locale: en_US.UTF-8
Name of "C" locale except for codecvt: *
Name of "C" locale except for ctype, which is unicode:
LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8;
LC_NUMERIC=C;
LC_TIME=C;
LC_COLLATE=C;
LC_MONETARY=C;
LC_MESSAGES=C;
LC_PAPER=C;
LC_NAME=C;
LC_ADDRESS=C;
LC_TELEPHONE=C;
LC_MEASUREMENT=C;
LC_IDENTIFICATION=C

Correct behavior

LWG 436

C++98

for overload (7), it was unclear
whether Facet can be cv-qualified

it can be const-qualified,
but not volatile-qualified

LWG 2295

C++98

for overload (7), the constructed locale had no name even if f is null

it has the name of other
