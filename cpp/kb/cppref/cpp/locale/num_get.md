Class std::num_get encapsulates the rules for parsing string representations of numeric values. Specifically, types bool, unsigned short, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long(since C++11), float, double, long double, and void* are supported. The standard formatting input operators (such as cin >> n;) use the std::num_get facet of the I/O stream's locale to parse the text representations of the numbers.

Inheritance diagram

If a std::num_get specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by the standard library (see below), the behaviors of its get() and do_get() are not guaranteed as specified.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale object):

Defined in header <locale> 

std::num_get<char>

creates narrow string parsing of numbers

std::num_get<wchar_t>

creates wide string parsing of numbers

In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every specialization that satisfies the following type requirements:

- CharT is one of
char,

- wchar_t, and

- any other implementation-defined character container type that meets the requirements for a character on which any of the iostream components can be instantiated; and

- InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

### Data members

Member

Description

std::locale::id id [static]

the identifier of the facet

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new num_get facet 
(public member function)

get

invokes do_get 
(public member function)

### Protected member functions

(destructor)

destructs a num_get facet 
(protected member function)

do_get

[virtual]

parses a number from an input stream 
(virtual protected member function)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <locale>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::string de_double = "1.234.567,89";
std::string us_double = "1,234,567.89";
 
// parse using streams
std::istringstream de_in(de_double);
de_in.imbue(std::locale("de_DE.UTF-8"));
double f1;
de_in >> f1;
 
std::istringstream us_in(de_double);
us_in.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
double f2;
us_in >> f2;
 
std::cout << "Parsing " << de_double << " as double gives " << std::fixed
<< f1 << " in de_DE locale and " << f2 << " in en_US\n";
 
// use the facet directly
std::istringstream s3(us_double);
s3.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
 
auto& f = std::use_facet<std::num_get<char>>(s3.getloc());
std::istreambuf_iterator<char> beg(s3), end;
double f3;
std::ios::iostate err;
f.get(beg, end, s3, err, f3);
 
std::cout << "parsing " << us_double
<< " as double using raw en_US facet gives " << f3 << '\n';
}

Output:

Parsing 1.234.567,89 as double gives 1234567.890000 in de_DE locale and 1.234000 in en_US
parsing 1,234,567.89 as double using raw en_US facet gives 1234567.890000

Correct behavior

LWG 427

C++98

num_get was guaranteed to accept any CharT that
meets the requirements for a character on which
any of the iostream components can be instantiated

only guarantees to accept char,
wchar_t and other implementation-
defined character types

LWG 2392

C++98

only character type CharT could be
guaranteed to be accepted by num_get

can guarantee to accept implementation-
defined character container types
