Defined in header <locale>

public:

void close( catalog c ) const;

(1)

protected:

virtual void do_close( catalog c ) const;

(2)

1) Public member function, calls the protected virtual member function do_close of the most derived class.

2) Releases the implementation-defined resources associated with an open catalog that is designated by the value c of type catalog (inherited from std::messages_base), which was obtained from open().

### Parameters

c

-

a valid open catalog identifier, on which close() has not yet been called

### Return value

(none)

### Notes

On POSIX systems, this function call usually translates to a call to catclose(). In GNU libstdc++, which is implemented in terms of GNU gettext(), it does nothing. 

### Example

The following example demonstrated retrieval of messages: on a typical GNU/Linux system it reads from /usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/sed.mo.

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
std::locale loc("de_DE.utf8");
std::cout.imbue(loc);
auto& facet = std::use_facet<std::messages<char>>(loc);
auto cat = facet.open("sed", loc);
if (cat < 0)
std::cout << "Could not open german \"sed\" message catalog\n";
else
std::cout << "\"No match\" in German: "
<< facet.get(cat, 0, 0, "No match") << '\n'
<< "\"Memory exhausted\" in German: "
<< facet.get(cat, 0, 0, "Memory exhausted") << '\n';
facet.close(cat);
}

Possible output:

"No match" in German: Keine Übereinstimmung
"Memory exhausted" in German: Speicher erschöpft
