> class num_put;

Class std::num_put encapsulates the rules for formatting numeric values as strings. Specifically, the types bool, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long(since C++11), double, long double, void*, and of all types implicitly convertible to these (such as int or float) are supported. The standard formatting output operators (such as cout << n;) use the std::num_put facet of the I/O stream's locale to generate text representation of numbers.

Inheritance diagram

If a std::num_put specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by the standard library (see below), the behaviors of its put() and do_put() are not guaranteed as specified.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale object):

Defined in header <locale> 

std::num_put<char>

creates narrow string representations of numbers

std::num_put<wchar_t>

creates wide string representations of numbers

In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every specialization that satisfies the following type requirements:

- CharT is one of
char,

- wchar_t, and

- any other implementation-defined character container type that meets the requirements for a character on which any of the iostream components can be instantiated; and

- OutputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator.

### Data members

Member

Description

std::locale::id id [static]

the identifier of the facet

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new num_put facet 
(public member function)

put

invokes do_put 
(public member function)

### Protected member functions

(destructor)

destructs a num_put facet 
(protected member function)

do_put

[virtual]

formats a number and writes to output stream 
(virtual protected member function)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <locale>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
double n = 1234567.89;
std::cout.imbue(std::locale("de_DE.UTF-8"));
std::cout << "Direct conversion to string:\n"
<< std::to_string(n) << '\n'
<< "Output using a german locale:\n"
<< std::fixed << n << '\n'
<< "Output using an american locale:\n";
 
// use the facet directly
std::cout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
auto& f = std::use_facet<std::num_put<char>>(std::cout.getloc());
f.put(std::ostreambuf_iterator<char>(std::cout), std::cout, ' ', n);
std::cout << '\n';
}

Possible output:

Direct conversion to string:
1234567.890000
Output using a german locale:
1.234.567,890000
Output using an american locale:
1,234,567.890000

Correct behavior

LWG 427

C++98

num_put was guaranteed to accept any CharT that
meets the requirements for a character on which
any of the iostream components can be instantiated

only guarantees to accept char,
wchar_t and other implementation-
defined character types

LWG 2392

C++98

only character type CharT could be
guaranteed to be accepted by num_put

can guarantee to accept implementation-
defined character container types
