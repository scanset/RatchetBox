> class time_put;

Class template std::time_put encapsulates date and time formatting rules. The I/O manipulator std::put_time uses the std::time_put facet of the I/O stream's locale to generate text representation of an std::tm object.

Inheritance diagram

If a std::time_put specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by the standard library (see below), the behaviors of its put() and do_put() are not guaranteed as specified.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale object):

Defined in header <locale> 

std::time_put<char>

creates narrow string representations of date and time

std::time_put<wchar_t>

creates wide string representations of date and time

In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every specialization that satisfies the following type requirements:

- CharT is one of char and wchar_t, and

- OutputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator.

### Data members

Member

Description

std::locale::id id [static]

the identifier of the facet

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new time_put facet 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destructs a time_put facet 
(protected member function)

put

invokes do_put 
(public member function)

### Protected member functions

do_put

[virtual]

formats date/time and writes to output stream 
(virtual protected member function)

### Example

Run this code

#include <codecvt>
#include <ctime>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::time_t t = std::time(nullptr);
std::wbuffer_convert<std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t>> conv(std::cout.rdbuf());
std::wostream out(&conv);
out.imbue(std::locale("ja_JP.utf8"));
 
// this I/O manipulator std::put_time uses std::time_put<wchar_t>
out << std::put_time(std::localtime(&t), L"%A %c") << '\n';
}

Output:
