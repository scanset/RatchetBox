public:

string_type curr_symbol() const;

(1)

protected:

virtual string_type do_curr_symbol() const;

(2)

1) Public member function, calls the member function do_curr_symbol of the most derived class.

2) Returns the string used as the currency identifier by this locale. If International (the second template parameter of std::moneypunct) is false, the identifier is usually a single (wide) character, such as "￥" or "$". If International is true, the identifier is usually a four-character string holding the three-character ISO 4217 currency code followed by a space ("JPY " or "USD ").

### Return value

The object of type string_type holding the currency symbol or code.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
void show_ccy(const char* locname)
{
std::locale loc(locname);
std::cout << locname << " currency symbol is "
<< std::use_facet<std::moneypunct<char, true>>(loc).curr_symbol()
<< "or " << std::use_facet<std::moneypunct<char>>(loc).curr_symbol()
<< " for short\n";
}
 
int main()
{
show_ccy("en_US.utf8");
show_ccy("ja_JP.utf8");
show_ccy("sv_SE.utf8");
show_ccy("ru_RU.utf8");
show_ccy("vi_VN.utf8");
}

Output:

en_US.utf8 currency symbol is USD or $ for short
ja_JP.utf8 currency symbol is JPY or ￥ for short
sv_SE.utf8 currency symbol is SEK or kr for short
ru_RU.utf8 currency symbol is RUB or руб for short
vi_VN.utf8 currency symbol is VND or ₫ for short
