Defined in header <locale>

template<>

class ctype<char>;

This specialization of std::ctype encapsulates character classification features for type char. Unlike general-purpose std::ctype, which uses virtual functions, this specialization uses table lookup to classify characters (which is generally faster).

The base class std::ctype<char> implements character classification equivalent to the minimal "C" locale. The classification rules can be extended or modified if constructed with a non-default classification table argument, if constructed as std::ctype_byname<char> or as a user-defined derived facet. All std::istream formatted input functions are required to use std::ctype<char> for character classing during input parsing.

### Data members

Member

Description

std::locale::id id [static]

the identifier of the facet

const std::size_t table_size [static]

size of the classification table, at least 256

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new ctype<char> facet 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destructs a ctype<char> facet 
(protected member function)

table

obtains the character classification table 
(public member function)

classic_table

[static]

obtains the "C" locale character classification table 
(public static member function)

is

classifies a character or a character sequence, using the classification table 
(public member function)

scan_is

locates the first character in a sequence that conforms to given classification, using the classification table 
(public member function)

scan_not

locates the first character in a sequence that fails given classification, using the classification table 
(public member function)

toupper

invokes do_toupper 
(public member function of std::ctype<CharT>)

tolower

invokes do_tolower 
(public member function of std::ctype<CharT>)

widen

invokes do_widen 
(public member function of std::ctype<CharT>)

narrow

invokes do_narrow 
(public member function of std::ctype<CharT>)

### Protected member functions

do_toupper

[virtual]

converts a character or characters to uppercase 
(virtual protected member function of std::ctype<CharT>)

do_tolower

[virtual]

converts a character or characters to lowercase 
(virtual protected member function of std::ctype<CharT>)

do_widen

[virtual]

converts a character or characters from char to CharT 
(virtual protected member function of std::ctype<CharT>)

do_narrow

[virtual]

converts a character or characters from CharT to char 
(virtual protected member function of std::ctype<CharT>)

### Example

The following example demonstrates modification of ctype<char> to tokenize comma-separated values:

Run this code

#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>
 
// This ctype facet classifies commas and endlines as whitespace
struct csv_whitespace : std::ctype<char>
{
static const mask* make_table()
{
// make a copy of the "C" locale table
static std::vector<mask> v(classic_table(), classic_table() + table_size);
v[','] |= space; // comma will be classified as whitespace
v[' '] &= ~space; // space will not be classified as whitespace
return &v[0];
}
 
csv_whitespace(std::size_t refs = 0) : ctype(make_table(), false, refs) {}
};
 
int main()
{
std::string in = "Column 1,Column 2,Column 3\n123,456,789";
std::string token;
 
std::cout << "Default locale:\n";
std::istringstream s1(in);
while (s1 >> token)
std::cout << " " << token << '\n';
 
std::cout << "Locale with modified ctype:\n";
std::istringstream s2(in);
s2.imbue(std::locale(s2.getloc(), new csv_whitespace));
while (s2 >> token)
std::cout << " " << token << '\n';
}

Output:

Default locale:
Column
1,Column
2,Column
3
123,456,789
Locale with modified ctype:
Column 1
Column 2
Column 3
123
456
789
