The preprocessor is executed at translation phase 4, before the compilation. The result of preprocessing is a single file which is then passed to the actual compiler.

### Directives

The preprocessing directives control the behavior of the preprocessor. Each directive occupies one line and has the following format:

- the # character.

- a sequence of:

- a standard-defined directive name (listed below) followed by the corresponding arguments, or

- one or more preprocessing tokens where the beginning token is not a standard-defined directive name, in this case the directive is conditionally-supported with implementation-defined semantics (e.g. a common non-standard extension is the directive #warning which emits a user-defined message during compilation)(until C++23), or

- nothing, in this case the directive has no effect.

- a line break.

The module and import directives are also preprocessing directives.

(since C++20)

Preprocessing directives must not come from macro expansion.

#define EMPTY
EMPTY # include <file.h> // not a preprocessing directive

### Capabilities

The preprocessor has the source file translation capabilities:

- conditionally compile parts of source file (controlled by directive #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #elif, #elifdef, #elifndef(since C++23), and #endif).

- replace text macros while possibly concatenating or quoting identifiers (controlled by directives #define and #undef, and operators # and ##).

- include other files (controlled by directive #include and checked with __has_include(since C++17)).

- cause an error or warning(since C++23) (controlled by directive #error or #warning respectively(since C++23)).

The following aspects of the preprocessor can be controlled:

- implementation-defined behavior (controlled by directive #pragma and operator _Pragma(since C++11)). In addition, some compilers support (to varying degrees) the operator __pragma as a non-standard extension.

- file name and line information available to the preprocessor (controlled by directive #line).
