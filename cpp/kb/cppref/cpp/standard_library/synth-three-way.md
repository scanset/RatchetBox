constexpr auto synth-three-way = /* see below */;

(1)
(since C++20) 
(exposition only*)

template< class T, class U = T >

using synth-three-way-result =

decltype(synth-three-way(std::declval<T&>(), std::declval<U&>()));

(2)
(since C++20) 
(exposition only*)

1) A function object whose operator() behaves as the synthesized three-way comparison function. Equivalent to:
constexpr auto synth-three-way =
[]<class T, class U>(const T& t, const U& u)
requires requires
{
{ t < u } -> boolean-testable;
{ u < t } -> boolean-testable;
}
{
if constexpr (std::three_way_comparable_with<T, U>)
return t <=> u;
else
{
if (t < u)
return std::weak_ordering::less;
if (u < t)
return std::weak_ordering::greater;
return std::weak_ordering::equivalent;
}
};

2) The return type of the operator() of (1) (synth-three-way).

### Parameters

t, u

-

the values to be compared

### Return value

The compare result.
