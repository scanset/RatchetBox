Compares the underlying iterators.

Let current_ be the underlying tuple-like object of iterators to elements of adapted views.

1) Returns:

- x.current_ == y.current_ if /*all-bidirectional*/<Const, Views...> is true.

- Otherwise, true if there exists an integer 0 <= i < sizeof...(Views) such that bool(std::get<i>(x.current_) == std::get<i>(y.current_)) is true.

- Otherwise, false.

2) Equivalent to return x.current_ <=> y.current_;.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::ranges::zip_view::iterator<Const> is an associated class of the arguments.

The <, <=, >, >=, and != operators are synthesized from operator<=> and operator== respectively.

### Parameters
