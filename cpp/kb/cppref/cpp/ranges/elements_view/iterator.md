template< bool Const >

class /*iterator*/;

(exposition only*)

The return type of elements_view::begin, and of elements_view::end when the underlying view is a common_range.

The type /*iterator*/<true> is returned by the const-qualified overloads. The type /*iterator*/<false> is returned by the non-const-qualified overloads.

### Member types

Member type

Definition

Base (private)

const V if Const is true, otherwise V.
(exposition-only member type*)

iterator_concept

Denotes:

- std::random_access_iterator_tag, if Base models random_access_range. Otherwise,

- std::bidirectional_iterator_tag, if Base models bidirectional_range. Otherwise,

- std::forward_iterator_tag, if Base models forward_range. Otherwise,

- std::input_iterator_tag.

iterator_category
(conditionally present)

Not defined, if Base does not model forward_range. Otherwise,

- std::input_iterator_tag, if std::get<N>(*current_) is an rvalue. Otherwise, let C be the type std::iterator_traits<std::iterator_t<Base>>::iterator_category.

- std::random_access_iterator_tag, if C models std::derived_from<std::random_access_iterator_tag>. Otherwise,

- C.

value_type

std::remove_cvref_t<std::tuple_element_t<N, ranges::range_value_t<Base>>>

difference_type

ranges::range_difference_t<Base>

### Data members

Member object

Definition

current_ (private)

An iterator of type ranges::iterator_t<Base> to current element of underlying sequence.
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs an iterator 
(public member function)

base

returns the underlying iterator 
(public member function)

operator*

accesses the Nth tuple element 
(public member function)

operator[]

accesses an element by index 
(public member function)

operator++operator++(int)operator--operator--(int)operator+=operator-=

advances or decrements the underlying iterator 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator<operator>operator<=operator>=operator<=>

(C++20)

compares the underlying iterators 
(function)

operator+operator-

(C++20)

performs iterator arithmetic 
(function)
