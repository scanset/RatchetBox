(since C++20)

1) A range adaptor that represents view consisting of the sequence obtained from flattening a view of ranges.

2) RangeAdaptorObject (and also RangeAdaptorClosureObject). The expression views::join(e) is expression-equivalent to join_view<views::all_t<decltype((e))>>{e} for any suitable subexpressions e.

join_view models input_range.

join_view models forward_range when:

- ranges::range_reference_t<V> is a reference type, and

- V and ranges::range_reference_t<V> each model forward_range.

join_view models bidirectional_range when:

- ranges::range_reference_t<V> is a reference type,

- V models bidirectional_range, and

- ranges::range_reference_t<V> models both bidirectional_range and common_range.

join_view models common_range when:

- ranges::range_reference_t<V> is a reference type, and

- V and ranges::range_reference_t<V> each model forward_range and common_range.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a join_view 
(public member function)

base

returns a copy of the underlying (adapted) view 
(public member function)

begin

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

end

returns an iterator or a sentinel to the end 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

back

returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies bidirectional_range and common_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Deduction guides

### Nested classes

iterator

the iterator type
(exposition-only member class template*)

sentinel

the sentinel type
(exposition-only member class template*)

### Notes

Before P2328R1 was adopted, the inner range type (ranges::range_reference_t<V>) cannot be a container type (but can be reference to container). For example, it was not allowed to join a transform_view of std::string prvalue.

struct Person { int age; std::string name; };
 
auto f(std::vector<Person>& v) {
// return v | std::views::transform([](auto& p){ return p.name; })
// | std::views::join; // error before P2328R1
return v | std::views::transform([](auto& p) -> std::string& { return p.name; })
std::views::join; // OK
}

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <string_view>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
using namespace std::literals;
 
const auto bits = {"https:"sv, "//"sv, "cppreference"sv, "."sv, "com"sv};
for (char const c : bits | std::views::join)
std::cout << c;
std::cout << '\n';
 
const std::vector<std::vector<int>> v{{1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}, {6}, {7, 8, 9}};
auto jv = std::ranges::join_view(v);
for (int const e : jv)
std::cout << e << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:
