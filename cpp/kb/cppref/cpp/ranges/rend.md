constexpr std::sentinel_for<

decltype(ranges::rbegin(std::declval<T>()))> auto rend( T&& t );

(since C++20)

Returns a sentinel indicating the end of a reversed range.

If T is an array type and std::remove_all_extents_t<std::remove_reference_t<T>> is incomplete, then the call to ranges::rend is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.

If the argument is an lvalue or ranges::enable_borrowed_range<std::remove_cv_t<T>> is true, then a call to ranges::rend is expression-equivalent to:

- decay-copy(t.rend())(until C++23)auto(t.rend())(since C++23), if that expression is valid and its type models std::sentinel_for<decltype(ranges::rbegin(std::declval<T>()))>.

- Otherwise, decay-copy(rend(t))(until C++23)auto(rend(t))(since C++23), if T is a class or enumeration type, that expression is valid and its type models std::sentinel_for<decltype(ranges::rbegin(std::declval<T>()))>, where the meaning of rend is established as if by performing argument-dependent lookup only.

- Otherwise, std::make_reverse_iterator(ranges::begin(t)) if both ranges::begin(t) and ranges::end(t) are valid expressions, have the same type, and that type models std::bidirectional_iterator.

In all other cases, a call to ranges::rend is ill-formed, which can result in substitution failure when ranges::rend(t) appears in the immediate context of a template instantiation.

### Customization point objects

The name ranges::rend denotes a customization point object, which is a const function object of a literal semiregular class type. For exposition purposes, the cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted as __rend_fn.

All instances of __rend_fn are equal. The effects of invoking different instances of type __rend_fn on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be invocable). Thus, ranges::rend can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to ranges::rend above, __rend_fn models

- std::invocable<__rend_fn, Args...>,

- std::invocable<const __rend_fn, Args...>,

- std::invocable<__rend_fn&, Args...>, and

- std::invocable<const __rend_fn&, Args...>.

Otherwise, no function call operator of __rend_fn participates in overload resolution.

### Notes

If the argument is an rvalue (i.e. T is an object type) and ranges::enable_borrowed_range<std::remove_cv_t<T>> is false, or if it is of an array type of unknown bound, the call to ranges::rend is ill-formed, which also results in substitution failure.

If ranges::rend(std::forward<T>(t)) is valid, then decltype(ranges::rend(std::forward<T>(t))) and decltype(ranges::begin(std::forward<T>(t))) model std::sentinel_for in all cases, while T models std::ranges::range.

The C++20 standard requires that if the underlying rend function call returns a prvalue, the return value is move-constructed from the materialized temporary object. All implementations directly return the prvalue instead. The requirement is corrected by the post-C++20 proposal P0849R8 to match the implementations.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
std::vector<int> v = {3, 1, 4};
namespace ranges = std::ranges;
if (ranges::find(ranges::rbegin(v), ranges::rend(v), 5) != ranges::rend(v))
std::cout << "found a 5 in vector v!\n";
 
int a[] = {5, 10, 15};
if (ranges::find(ranges::rbegin(a), ranges::rend(a), 5) != ranges::rend(a))
std::cout << "found a 5 in array a!\n";
}

Output:

found a 5 in array a!
