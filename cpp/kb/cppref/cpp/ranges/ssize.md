constexpr auto ssize( T&& t );

(since C++20)

Calculates the number of elements in t in constant time, and converts the result to a signed type.

Given the subexpression of which t denotes the (possibly materialized) result object as E:

- If ranges::size(t) is ill-formed, ranges::ssize(E) is also ill-formed.

- Otherwise, let Signed be make-signed-like-t ﻿<decltype(ranges::size(t))>:
If std::ptrdiff_t is wider than Signed, ranges::ssize(E) is expression-equivalent to static_cast<std::ptrdiff_t>(ranges::size(t)).

- Otherwise, ranges::ssize(E) is expression-equivalent to static_cast<Signed>(ranges::size(t)).

### Customization point objects

The name ranges::ssize denotes a customization point object, which is a const function object of a literal semiregular class type. For exposition purposes, the cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted as __ssize_fn.

All instances of __ssize_fn are equal. The effects of invoking different instances of type __ssize_fn on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be invocable). Thus, ranges::ssize can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to ranges::ssize above, __ssize_fn models

- std::invocable<__ssize_fn, Args...>,

- std::invocable<const __ssize_fn, Args...>,

- std::invocable<__ssize_fn&, Args...>, and

- std::invocable<const __ssize_fn&, Args...>.

Otherwise, no function call operator of __ssize_fn participates in overload resolution.

### Notes

If ranges::ssize(e) is valid for an expression e, the return type is a signed-integer-like type.

### Example

Run this code

#include <array>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <type_traits>
 
int main()
{
std::array arr{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
auto s = std::ranges::ssize(arr);
 
std::cout << "ranges::ssize(arr) = " << s << '\n'
<< "ranges::ssize is "
<< (std::is_signed_v<decltype(s)> ? "signed" : "unsigned")
<< '\n';
 
std::cout << "reversed arr: ";
 
for (--s; s >= 0; --s)
std::cout << arr[s] << ' ';
 
std::cout << "\n" "s = " << s << '\n';
}

Output:

ranges::ssize(arr) = 5
ranges::ssize is signed
reversed arr: 5 4 3 2 1
s = -1
