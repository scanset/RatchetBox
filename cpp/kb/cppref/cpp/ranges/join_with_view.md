1) A range adaptor that represents view consisting of the sequence obtained from flattening a view of ranges, with every element of the delimiter inserted in between elements of the view. The delimiter can be a single element or a view of elements.

For the definition of /*concatable*/, see std::ranges::concat_view.

2) RangeAdaptorObject. The expression views::join_with(e, f) is expression-equivalent to join_with_view(e, f) for any suitable subexpressions e and f.

join_with_view models input_range.

join_with_view models forward_range when:

- ranges::range_reference_t<V> is a reference, and

- V and ranges::range_reference_t<V> each model forward_range.

join_with_view models bidirectional_range when:

- ranges::range_reference_t<V> is a reference,

- V, ranges::range_reference_t<V>, and Pattern each models bidirectional_range, and

- ranges::range_reference_t<V> and Pattern each model common_range.

join_with_view models common_range when:

- ranges::range_reference_t<V> is a reference, and

- V and ranges::range_reference_t<V> each model forward_range and common_range.

the pattern object
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a join_with_view 
(public member function)

base

returns a copy of the underlying (adapted) view 
(public member function)

begin

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

end

returns an iterator or a sentinel to the end 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

back

returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies bidirectional_range and common_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <string_view>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
using namespace std::literals;
 
std::vector v{"This"sv, "is"sv, "a"sv, "test."sv};
auto joined = v | std::views::join_with(' ');
 
for (auto c : joined)
std::cout << c;
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

This is a test.
