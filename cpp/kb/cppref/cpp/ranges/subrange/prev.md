constexpr subrange prev( std::iter_difference_t<I> n = 1 ) const

    requires std::bidirectional_iterator<I>;

(since C++20)

Returns a copy of *this whose begin_ is decremented (or incremented if n is negative). The actual decrement (or increment) operation is performed by advance().

Equivalent to:auto tmp = *this;
tmp.advance(-n);
return tmp;.

### Parameters

n

-

number of decrements of the iterator

### Return value

As described above.

### Notes

The difference between this function and advance() is that the latter performs the decrement (or increment) in place.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iterator>
#include <list>
#include <print>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
std::list list{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
std::ranges::subrange sub{std::next(list.begin(), 2), std::prev(list.end(), 2)};
std::println("{} {} {}", sub, sub.prev(), sub.prev(2));
}

Output:

[3] [2, 3] [1, 2, 3]
