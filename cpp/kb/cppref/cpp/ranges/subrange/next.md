constexpr subrange next( std::iter_difference_t<I> n = 1 ) const&

    requires std::forward_iterator<I>;

(1)
(since C++20)

constexpr subrange next( std::iter_difference_t<I> n = 1 ) &&;

(2)
(since C++20)

Returns a subrange whose begin_ is incremented (or decremented if n is negative). The actual increment (or decrement) operation is performed by advance().

1) Returns a copy of *this.

Equivalent to: auto tmp = *this;
tmp.advance(n);
return tmp;.

2) Returns a subrange moved from *this.

Equivalent to: advance(n);
return std::move(*this);.

### Parameter

n

-

number of maximal increments of the iterator

### Return value

As described above.

### Notes

The difference between this function and advance() is that the latter performs the increment (or decrement) in place.

### Example

Run this code

#include <array>
#include <iterator>
#include <print>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
std::array arr{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
std::ranges::subrange sub{std::next(arr.begin(), 2), std::prev(arr.end(), 2)};
std::println("1) sub: {}", sub);
std::println("2) sub: {}", sub.next());
std::println("3) sub: {}", sub.next(2));
}

Output:

1) sub: [3, 4, 5]
2) sub: [4, 5]
3) sub: [5]
