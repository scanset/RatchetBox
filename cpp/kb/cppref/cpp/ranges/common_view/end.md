constexpr auto end() requires (!/*simple-view*/<V>);

(1)
(since C++20)

constexpr auto end() const requires ranges::range<const V>;

(2)
(since C++20)

1) Returns an iterator representing the end of the common_view, that is:

- ranges::begin(base_) + ranges::distance(base_), if both ranges::random_access_range<V> and ranges::sized_range<V> are satisfied,

- std::common_iterator<ranges::iterator_t<V>, ranges::sentinel_t<V>>(ranges::end(base_)) otherwise.

Here base_ (the name is for exposition purposes only) is the underlying view.

2) Same as (1), but V is const-qualified.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

An iterator representing the end of the underlying view.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
constexpr int n{4};
 
constexpr auto v1 = std::views::iota(1)
std::views::take(n)
std::views::common
;
constexpr auto v2 = std::views::iota(2)
std::views::take(n)
;
const int product = std::inner_product(v1.begin(), v1.end(),
v2.begin(),
0);
std::cout << product << '\n';
}

Output:

40
