constexpr /*iterator*/& operator++();

(1)
(since C++23)

constexpr /*iterator*/ operator++(int);

(2)
(since C++23)

constexpr /*iterator*/& operator--() requires ranges::bidirectional_range<V>;

(3)
(since C++23)

constexpr /*iterator*/ operator--(int) requires ranges::bidirectional_range<V>;

(4)
(since C++23)

Increments or decrements the iterator.

Let 
parent_,
current_, and
next_ be the appropriate underlying (exposition-only) data-members of iterator.

Let
find-next and
find-prev be
appropriate (exposition-only) member functions of ranges::chunk_by_view.

1) Equivalent to:
current_ = next_;
next_ = parent_->/*find-next*/(current_);
return *this;

The behavior is undefined if before the call to this operator current_ is equal to next_.

2) Equivalent to: auto tmp = *this; ++*this; return tmp;

3) Equivalent to:
next_ = current_;
current_ = parent_->/*find-prev*/(next_);
return *this;

4) Equivalent to: auto tmp = *this; --*this; return tmp;

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

1,3) *this

2,4) a copy of *this that was made before the change.
