(exposition only*)

The return type of chunk_by_view::begin, and of chunk_by_view::end when the underlying view V is a common_range.

### Data members

Member name

Definition

parent_ (private)

A pointer to the parent chunk_by_view.
(exposition-only member object*)

current_ (private)

ranges::iterator_t<V>, an iterator to the begin of current chunk.
(exposition-only member object*)

next_ (private)

ranges::iterator_t<V>, an iterator to the begin of next chunk, if present.

### Member functions

(constructor)

(public member function)

operator*

(public member function)

operator++operator++(int)operator--operator--(int)
