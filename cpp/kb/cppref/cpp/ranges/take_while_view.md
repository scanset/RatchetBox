Call signature

template< ranges::viewable_range R, class Pred >

    requires /* see below */

constexpr ranges::view auto take_while( R&& r, Pred&& pred );

(since C++20)

template< class Pred >

constexpr /*range adaptor closure*/ take_while( Pred&& pred );

(since C++20)

1) A range adaptor that represents view of the elements from an underlying sequence, starting at the beginning and ending at the first element for which the predicate returns false.

2) RangeAdaptorObject. The expression views::take_while(e, f) is expression-equivalent to take_while_view(e, f) for any suitable subexpressions e and f.

take_while_view models the concepts contiguous_range, random_access_range, bidirectional_range, forward_range, and input_range when the underlying view V models respective concepts.

### Data members

Member name

Definition

base_ (private)

the underlying view of type V
(exposition-only member object*)

pred_ (private)

the underlying function object of type copyable-box<Pred>(until C++23)movable-box<Pred>(since C++23)
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a take_while_view 
(public member function)

base

returns a copy of the underlying (adapted) view 
(public member function)

pred

returns a reference to the stored predicate 
(public member function)

begin

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

end

returns a sentinel representing the end 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

data

gets the address of derived view's data. Provided if its iterator type satisfies contiguous_iterator. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator[]

returns the nth element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies random_access_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Deduction guides

### Nested classes

sentinel

the sentinel type
(exposition-only member class template*)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
for (int year : std::views::iota(2020)
std::views::take_while([](int y){ return y < 2026; }))
std::cout << year << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
 
const char note[]{"Today is yesterday's tomorrow!..."};
auto not_dot = [](char c){ return c != '.'; };
for (char x : std::ranges::take_while_view(note, not_dot))
std::cout << x;
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025
Today is yesterday's tomorrow!
