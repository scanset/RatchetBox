1) zip_view is a range adaptor that takes one or more views, and produces a view whose ith element is a tuple-like value consisting of the ith elements of all views. The size of produced view is the minimum of sizes of all adapted views.

2) views::zip is a customization point object.

When calling with no argument, views::zip() is expression-equivalent to auto(views::empty<std::tuple<>>).

Otherwise, views::zip(rs...) is expression-equivalent to ranges::zip_view<views::all_t<decltype((rs))>...>(rs...).

zip_view always models input_range, and models forward_range, bidirectional_range, random_access_range, or sized_range if all adapted view types model the corresponding concept.

zip_view models common_range if

- sizeof...(Views) is equal to 1, and the only adapted view type models common_range, or

- at least one adapted view type does not model bidirectional_range, and every adapted view type models common_range, or

- every adapted view type models both random_access_range and sized_range.

### Customization point objects

The name views::zip denotes a customization point object, which is a const function object of a literal semiregular class type. For exposition purposes, the cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted as __zip_fn.

All instances of __zip_fn are equal. The effects of invoking different instances of type __zip_fn on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be invocable). Thus, views::zip can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to views::zip above, __zip_fn models

- std::invocable<__zip_fn, Args...>,

- std::invocable<const __zip_fn, Args...>,

- std::invocable<__zip_fn&, Args...>, and

- std::invocable<const __zip_fn&, Args...>.

Otherwise, no function call operator of __zip_fn participates in overload resolution.

### Data members

Member

Description

std::tuple<Views...> views_

all adapted view objects
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a zip_view 
(public member function)

begin

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

end

returns an iterator or a sentinel to the end 
(public member function)

size

returns the number of elements. Provided only if each underlying (adapted) range satisfies sized_range. 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

back

returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies bidirectional_range and common_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator[]

returns the nth element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies random_access_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Deduction guides

### Nested classes

iterator

the iterator type
(exposition-only member class template*)

sentinel

the sentinel type used when zip_view is not a common_range
(exposition-only member class template*)

### Helper templates

template< class... Views >

constexpr bool enable_borrowed_range<ranges::zip_view<Views...>> =

(ranges::enable_borrowed_range<Views> && ...);

(since C++23)

This specialization of ranges::enable_borrowed_range makes zip_view satisfy borrowed_range when each underlying view satisfies it.

### Example

Run this code

#include <array>
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <ranges>
#include <string>
#include <tuple>
#include <vector>
 
void print(auto const rem, auto const& range)
{
for (std::cout << rem; auto const& elem : range)
std::cout << elem << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
auto x = std::vector{1, 2, 3, 4};
auto y = std::list<std::string>{"α", "β", "γ", "δ", "ε"};
auto z = std::array{'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'};
 
print("Source views:", "");
print("x: ", x);
print("y: ", y);
print("z: ", z);
 
print("\nzip(x,y,z):", "");
 
for (std::tuple<int&, std::string&, char&> elem : std::views::zip(x, y, z))
{
std::cout << std::get<0>(elem) << ' '
<< std::get<1>(elem) << ' '
<< std::get<2>(elem) << '\n';
 
std::get<char&>(elem) += ('a' - 'A'); // modifies the element of z
}
 
print("\nAfter modification, z: ", z);
}

Output:

Source views:
x: 1 2 3 4
y: α β γ δ ε
z: A B C D E F
 
zip(x,y,z):
1 α A
2 β B
3 γ C
4 δ D
 
After modification, z: a b c d E F
