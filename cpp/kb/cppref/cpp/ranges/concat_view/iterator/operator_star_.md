constexpr decltype(auto) operator*() const;

(since C++26)

Returns a reference to the current element in the concat_view.

Equivalent to 
using reference = concat-reference-t ﻿<maybe-const ﻿<Const, Views>...>;

return std::visit([](auto&& it) -> reference { return *it; }, it_ ﻿);
.

If it_ ﻿.valueless_by_exception() is true, the behavior is undefined.
