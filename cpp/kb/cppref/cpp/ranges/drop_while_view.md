Call signature

constexpr ranges::view auto drop_while( R&& r, Pred&& pred );

constexpr /*range adaptor closure*/ drop_while( Pred&& pred );

(since C++20)

1) A range adaptor that represents view of elements from an underlying sequence, beginning at the first element for which the predicate returns false.

2) RangeAdaptorObject. The expression views::drop_while(e, f) is expression-equivalent to drop_while_view(e, f) for any suitable subexpressions e and f.

drop_while_view models the concepts contiguous_range, random_access_range, bidirectional_range, forward_range, input_range, and common_range when the underlying view V models respective concepts. It also models sized_range if ranges::forward_range<V> and std::sized_sentinel_for<ranges::sentinel_t<V>, ranges::iterator_t<V>> are modeled.

### Data members

Member name

Definition

base_ (private)

the underlying view of type V
(exposition-only member object*)

pred_ (private)

the underlying function object of type copyable-box<Pred>(until C++23)movable-box<Pred>(since C++23)
(exposition-only member object*)

cache_ (private) 
(conditionally present)

TODO: mension L4$, see notes.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a drop_while_view 
(public member function)

base

returns a copy of the underlying (adapted) view 
(public member function)

pred

returns a reference to the stored predicate 
(public member function)

begin

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

end

returns an iterator or a sentinel to the end 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

data

gets the address of derived view's data. Provided if its iterator type satisfies contiguous_iterator. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

size

returns the number of elements in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range and its sentinel and iterator type satisfy sized_sentinel_for. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

back

returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies bidirectional_range and common_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator[]

returns the nth element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies random_access_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Deduction guides

### Helper templates

template< class T, class Pred >

constexpr bool enable_borrowed_range<std::ranges::drop_while_view<T, Pred>> =

ranges::enable_borrowed_range<T>;

(since C++20)

This specialization of std::ranges::enable_borrowed_range makes drop_while_view satisfy borrowed_range when the underlying view satisfies it.

### Notes

In order to provide the amortized constant time complexity required by the range concept, the result of begin is cached within the drop_while_view object. If the underlying range is modified after the first call to begin(), subsequent uses of the drop_while_view object might have unintuitive behavior.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>
 
using std::operator""sv;
 
[[nodiscard]]
constexpr bool is_space(char p) noexcept
{
auto ne = [p](auto q) { return p != q; };
return !!(" \t\n\v\r\f" | std::views::drop_while(ne));
};
 
[[nodiscard("trims the output")]]
constexpr std::string_view trim_left(std::string_view const in) noexcept
{
auto view = in | std::views::drop_while(is_space);
return {view.begin(), view.end()};
}
 
[[nodiscard("trims the output")]]
constexpr std::string trim(std::string_view const in)
{
auto view = in
std::views::drop_while(is_space)
std::views::reverse
std::views::drop_while(is_space)
std::views::reverse
;
return {view.begin(), view.end()};
}
 
int main()
{
static_assert(trim_left(" \n C++23") == "C++23"sv);
 
constexpr auto src{" \f\n\t\r\vHello, C++20!\f\n\t\r\v "sv};
static_assert(trim(src) == "Hello, C++20!");
 
static constexpr auto v = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int n : v | std::views::drop_while([](int i) { return i < 3; }))
std::cout << n << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

3 4 5
