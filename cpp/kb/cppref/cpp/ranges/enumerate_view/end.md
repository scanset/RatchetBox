constexpr auto end() requires (!__simple_view<V>);

(1)
(since C++23)

constexpr auto end() const requires /*range-with-movable-references*/<const V>;

(2)
(since C++23)

Returns an iterator or a sentinel that compares equal to the end iterator of the enumerate_view.

Let base_ denote the underlying view.

1) Equivalent to:
if constexpr (ranges::forward_range<V> and 
ranges::common_range<V> and 
ranges::sized_range<V>)
return /*iterator*/<false>(ranges::end(base_), ranges::distance(base_));
else
return /*sentinel*/<false>(ranges::end(base_));

2) Equivalent to:
if constexpr (ranges::forward_range<const V> and 
ranges::common_range<const V> and 
ranges::sized_range<const V>)
return /*iterator*/<true>(ranges::end(base_), ranges::distance(base_));
else
return /*sentinel*/<true>(ranges::end(base_));
