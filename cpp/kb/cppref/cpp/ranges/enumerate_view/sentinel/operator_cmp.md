friend constexpr bool operator==( const /*iterator*/<Const>& x, const /*sentinel*/& y );

(since C++23)

Compares the underlying iterator of x with the underlying sentinel of y.

Let current_ denote the underlying iterator of x and end_ denote the underlying sentinel of y. Equivalent to:

return x.current_ == y.end_;.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when enumerate_view::sentinel<Const> is an associated class of the arguments.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

### Parameters

x

-

an iterator to compare

y

-

a sentinel to compare

### Return value
