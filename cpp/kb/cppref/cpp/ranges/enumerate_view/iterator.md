template< bool Const >

class /*iterator*/

(since C++23) 
(exposition only*)

The return type of enumerate_view::begin, and of enumerate_view::end when the underlying view V is a common_range.

The type /*iterator*/<true> is returned by the const-qualified overloads. The type /*iterator*/<false> is returned by the non-const-qualified overloads.

### Member types

Member type

Definition

Base (private)

const V if Const is true, otherwise V.
(exposition-only member type*)

iterator_category

std::input_iterator_tag

iterator_concept

- std::random_access_iterator_tag, if Base models random_access_range. Otherwise,

- std::bidirectional_iterator_tag, if Base models bidirectional_range. Otherwise,

- std::forward_iterator_tag, if Base models forward_range. Otherwise,

- std::input_iterator_tag.

difference_type

ranges::range_difference_t<Base>

value_type

std::tuple<difference_type, ranges::range_value_t<Base>>

reference-type (private)

std::tuple<difference_type, ranges::range_reference_t<Base>>
(exposition-only member type*)

### Data members

Member name

Definition

current_ (private)

An iterator to the current element of type ranges::iterator_t<Base>
(exposition-only member object*)

pos_ (private)

A current index of type difference_type
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs an iterator 
(public member function)

base

returns an iterator to current element 
(public member function)

index

returns current index 
(public member function)

operator*

accesses the element 
(public member function)

operator[]

accesses an element by index 
(public member function)

operator++operator++(int)operator--operator--(int)operator+=operator-=

advances or decrements the underlying iterator 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator<=>

(C++23)

compares the underlying iterators 
(function)

operator+operator-

(C++23)

performs iterator arithmetic 
(function)

iter_move

(C++23)

casts the result of dereferencing the underlying iterator to its associated rvalue reference type 
(function)
