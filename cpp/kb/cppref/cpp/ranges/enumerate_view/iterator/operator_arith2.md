(4)
(since C++23)

Performs iterator arithmetic or calculates the distance.

pos_ is the underlying index, and Base is the (possibly const-qualified) type of underlying view.

Equivalent to:

1) auto temp = i; temp += n; return temp;

2) return i + n;

3) auto temp = i; temp -= n; return temp;

4) return i.pos_ - j.pos_;

These functions are not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when enumerate_view::iterator<Const> is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

i, j

-

the iterators

n

-

position relative to current location

### Return value

1,2) An incremented iterator.

3) A decremented iterator.

4) A distance between given iterators.
