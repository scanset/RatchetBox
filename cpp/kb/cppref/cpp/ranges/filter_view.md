Call signature

template< ranges::viewable_range R, class Pred >

constexpr ranges::view auto filter( R&& r, Pred&& pred );

(since C++20)

template< class Pred >

constexpr /* range adaptor closure */ filter( Pred&& pred );

(since C++20)

1) A range adaptor that represents view of an underlying sequence without the elements that fail to satisfy a predicate.

2) RangeAdaptorObject. The expression views::filter(e, p) is expression-equivalent to filter_view(e, p) for any suitable subexpressions e and p.

filter_view models the concepts bidirectional_range, forward_range, input_range, and common_range when the underlying view V models respective concepts.

### Data members

Member name

Definition

base_ (private)

The underlying view of type V.
(exposition-only member object*)

pred_ (private)

Wraps the predicate used to filter out elements of base_ of type copyable-box<Pred>(until C++23)movable-box<Pred>(since C++23) augmenting Pred with assignability when needed and hence always satisfies copyableor movable(since C++23).
(exposition-only member object*)

begin_ (private) 
(conditionally present)

An object of optional-like type that caches an iterator to the first element of base_ that satisfies the pred_. Present only if filter_view models forward_range.
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a filter_view 
(public member function)

base

returns the underlying view V 
(public member function)

pred

returns a reference to the predicate stored within filter_view 
(public member function)

begin

returns the beginning iterator of the filter_view 
(public member function)

end

returns the sentinel of the filter_view 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

back

returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies bidirectional_range and common_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

## std::ranges::filter_view::filter_view

filter_view() requires std::default_initializable<V> &&

                       std::default_initializable<Pred> = default;

(1)
(since C++20)

constexpr explicit filter_view( V base, Pred pred );

(2)
(since C++20)

1) Value-initializes base_ via its default member initializer (= V()) and default-initializes pred_ (which value-initializes the contained Pred).

2) Initializes base_ with std::move(base) and initializes pred_ with std::move(pred).

### Parameters

base

-

range to filter

pred

-

predicate to filter out elements

## std::ranges::filter_view::base

constexpr V base() const& requires std::copy_constructible<V>;

(1)
(since C++20)

constexpr V base() &&;

(2)
(since C++20)

1) Equivalent to return base_;.

2) Equivalent to return std::move(base_);.

## std::ranges::filter_view::pred

constexpr const Pred& pred() const;

(since C++20)

Returns a reference to the contained Pred object. The behavior is undefined if pred_ does not contain a value.

## std::ranges::filter_view::begin

constexpr /*iterator*/ begin();

(exposition only*)

In order to provide the amortized constant time complexity required by the range concept, this function caches the result within the filter_view object for use on subsequent calls. Equivalent to

if constexpr (!ranges::forward_range<V>)
return /*iterator*/{*this, ranges::find_if(base_, std::ref(*pred_))};
else
{
if (!begin_.has_value())
begin_ = ranges::find_if(base_, std::ref(*pred_)); // caching
return /*iterator*/{*this, begin_.value())};
}

The behavior is undefined if pred_ does not contain a value.

## std::ranges::filter_view::end

constexpr auto end();

(since C++20)

Returns an iterator to the end. Equivalent to

if constexpr (ranges::common_range<V>)
return /*iterator*/{*this, ranges::end(base_)};
else
return /*sentinel*/{*this};

### Deduction guides

template< class R, class Pred >

filter_view( R&&, Pred ) -> filter_view<views::all_t<R>, Pred>;

(since C++20)

### Nested classes

iterator

the iterator type of filter_view
(exposition-only member class*)

sentinel

the sentinel type of filter_view when the underlying view is not a common_range
(exposition-only member class*)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
auto even = [](int i) { return 0 == i % 2; };
auto square = [](int i) { return i * i; };
 
for (int i : std::views::iota(0, 6)
std::views::filter(even)
std::views::transform(square))
std::cout << i << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

0 4 16
