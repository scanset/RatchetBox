template< class T >

    requires std::is_object_v<T>

class /*non-propagating-cache*/;

(since C++20) 
(exposition only*)

Some range adaptors such as ranges::join_view and ranges::lazy_split_view conditionally store value (e.g. an iterator) which is specified in terms of an exposition-only class template non-propagating-cache.

The wrapper behaves exactly like std::optional<T>, except that:

- it does not copy the value of the source when it is copy constructed or assigned to,

- it resets the value of the source when it is moved-from, 

- it resets its value when it is assigned from, and

- it additionally provides a member function template to enable an input view to temporarily cache values as it is iterated over.

The wrapper encapsulates a cache containing a value. Clearing cache is an operation equivalent to resetting a contained value. Such operation is performed when copying or moving a wrapper. 

### Template parameters

T

-

the type of the contained value, must be an object type

### Member functions

## Copy and move constructors

constexpr /*non-propagating-cache*/

    ( const /*non-propagating-cache*/& ) noexcept {}

(1)
(since C++20)

constexpr /*non-propagating-cache*/

    ( /*non-propagating-cache*/&& other ) noexcept { other.reset(); }

(2)
(since C++20)

1) The copy constructor has no effect.

2) The move constructor clears the cache of other.

## Copy and move assignment operators

constexpr /*non-propagating-cache*/&

    operator=( const /*non-propagating-cache*/& other ) noexcept

{ 

    if (std::addressof(other) != this)

        reset();

    return *this;

}

(1)
(since C++20)

constexpr /*non-propagating-cache*/&

    operator=( /*non-propagating-cache*/&& other ) noexcept

{

    reset();

    other.reset();

    return *this;

}

(2)
(since C++20)

1) The copy assignment operator clears the cache of *this.

2) The move assignment operator clears caches of both *this and other.

## non-propagating-cache<T>::emplace-deref

template< class I >

constexpr T& /*emplace-deref*/( const I& i );

(since C++20) 
(exposition only*)

Initializes the contained value by direct-initializing (but not direct-list-initializing) with *i. If *this already contains a value before the call, reset() is called.

Returns a reference to the new contained value.

The program is ill-formed unless the declaration T t(*i); is well-formed for some invented variable t. If *i is a prvalue of possibly cv-qualified T, then it is not required to be movable.

## Members identical to std::optional 

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs the optional object 
(public member function of std::optional<T>)

(destructor)

destroys the contained value, if there is one 
(public member function of std::optional<T>)

operator=

assigns contents 
(public member function of std::optional<T>)

#### Observers 

operator->operator*

accesses the contained value 
(public member function of std::optional<T>)

operator boolhas_value

checks whether the object contains a value 
(public member function of std::optional<T>)

#### Modifiers 

reset

destroys any contained value 
(public member function of std::optional<T>)

emplace

constructs the contained value in-place 
(public member function of std::optional<T>)

### Notes

non-propagating-cache is used in implementations to cache the result of begin() to provide an amortized constant time complexity of the method.
