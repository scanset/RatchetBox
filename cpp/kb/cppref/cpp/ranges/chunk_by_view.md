1) chunk_by_view is a range adaptor that takes a view and an invocable object pred (the binary predicate), and produces a view of subranges (chunks), by splitting the underlying view between each pair of adjacent elements for which pred returns false. The first element of each such pair belongs to the previous chunk, and the second element belongs to the next chunk.

2) The name views::chunk_by denotes a RangeAdaptorObject. Given a subexpression e and f, the expression views::chunk_by(e, f) is expression-equivalent to chunk_by_view(e, f).

chunk_by_view always models forward_range, and models bidirectional_range and/or common_range, if adapted view type models the corresponding concepts.
chunk_by_view never models borrowed_range or sized_range.

### Data members

Member

Definition

V base_

the underlying view
(exposition-only member object*)

movable-box<Pred> pred_

an object that wraps the predicate used to split the elements of base_
(exposition-only member object*)

non-propagating-cache<iterator> begin_

an object that caches the iterator to the first element
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a chunk_by_view 
(public member function)

base

returns a copy of the underlying (adapted) view 
(public member function)

pred

returns a reference to the stored predicate 
(public member function)

begin

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

end

returns an iterator or a sentinel to the end 
(public member function)

find_next

returns an iterator to the begin of the next subrange
(exposition-only member function*)

find_prev

returns an iterator to the begin of the previous subrange
(exposition-only member function*)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

back

returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies bidirectional_range and common_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Deduction guides

### Nested classes

iterator

the iterator type
(exposition-only member class template*)

### Notes

In order to provide the amortized constant time complexity required by the range concept, the result of begin() is cached within the chunk_by_view object. If the underlying range is modified after the first call to begin(), subsequent uses of the chunk_by_view object might have unintuitive behavior.

### Example

Run this code

#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <string_view>
 
void print_chunks(auto view, std::string_view separator = ", ")
{
for (auto const subrange : view)
{
std::cout << '[';
for (std::string_view prefix; auto const& elem : subrange)
std::cout << prefix << elem, prefix = separator;
std::cout << "] ";
}
std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
std::initializer_list v1 = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3};
auto fn1 = std::ranges::less{};
auto view1 = v1 | std::views::chunk_by(fn1);
print_chunks(view1);
 
std::initializer_list v2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1};
auto fn2 = std::ranges::not_equal_to{};
auto view2 = v2 | std::views::chunk_by(fn2);
print_chunks(view2);
 
std::string_view v3 = "__cpp_lib_ranges_chunk_by";
auto fn3 = [](auto x, auto y) { return not(x == '_' or y == '_'); };
auto view3 = v3 | std::views::chunk_by(fn3);
print_chunks(view3, "");
 
std::string_view v4 = "\u007a\u00df\u6c34\u{1f34c}"; // "zß水🍌"
auto fn4 = [](auto, auto ß) { return 128 == ((128 + 64) & ß); };
auto view4 = v4 | std::views::chunk_by(fn4);
print_chunks(view4, "");
}

Output:

[1, 2, 3] [1, 2, 3] [3] [3] [1, 2, 3] 
[1, 2, 3, 4] [4, 0, 2, 3] [3] [3, 2, 1] 
[_] [_] [cpp] [_] [lib] [_] [ranges] [_] [chunk] [_] [by]
[z] [ß] [水] [🍌]
