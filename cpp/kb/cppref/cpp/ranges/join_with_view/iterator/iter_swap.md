friend constexpr void iter_swap( const /*iterator*/& x, const /*iterator*/& y )

    requires std::indirectly_swappable<ranges::iterator_t</*InnerBase*/>,

ranges::iterator_t</*PatternBase*/>>;

(since C++23)

Applies ranges::iter_swap to the inner iterators as if by std::visit(ranges::iter_swap, x.inner_it_ ﻿, y.inner_it_ ﻿);.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when join_with_view::iterator ﻿<Const> is an associated class of the arguments.
