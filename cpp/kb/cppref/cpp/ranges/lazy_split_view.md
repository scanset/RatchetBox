(exposition only*)

1) lazy_split_view takes a view and a delimiter, and splits the view into subranges on the delimiter.
Two major scenarios are supported:

- The view is an input_range, the delimiter is a single element (wrapped in a single_view).

- The view is a forward_range, the delimiter is a view of elements.

2) A RangeAdaptorObject. The expression views::lazy_split(e, f) is expression-equivalent to lazy_split_view(e, f).

3) The exposition-only concept /*tiny-range*/<Pattern> is satisfied if Pattern satisfies sized_range, Pattern::size() is a constant expression and suitable as a template non-type argument, and the value of Pattern::size() is less than or equal to 1. Notably, empty_view and single_view satisfy this concept.

lazy_split_view models the concepts forward_range and input_range when the underlying view V models respective concepts, and models common_range when V models both forward_range and common_range.

The inner range (ranges::range_reference_t<lazy_split_view>) models the concepts forward_range and input_range when the underlying view V models respective concepts. It does not model common_range, and cannot be used with algorithms that expect a bidirectional_range or higher.

Unlike split_view, lazy_split_view does not maintain the continuity of the subrange.

### Data members

Member

Description

V base_ (private)

the underlying view
(exposition-only member object*)

Pattern pattern_ (private)

the pattern that is used as a delimiter to split the underlying view
(exposition-only member object*)

non-propagating-cache<ranges::iterator_t<V>> current_ (private) 
(present only if V does not satisfy forward_range)

an object that caches the result of calls to begin()
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a lazy_split_view 
(public member function)

base

returns a copy of the underlying (adapted) view 
(public member function)

begin

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

end

returns an iterator or a sentinel to the end 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Nested classes

outer_iterator

the iterator type
(exposition-only member class template*)

inner_iterator

the iterator type of the inner range
(exposition-only member class template*)

### Deduction guides

### Notes

The name lazy_split_view is introduced by the post-C++20 defect report P2210R2. It has the same lazy mechanism as that of the old split_view before change.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <string_view>
 
auto print = [](auto const& view)
{
// `view` is of std::views::lazy_split_view::__outer_iterator::value_type
 
for (std::cout << "{ "; const auto element : view)
std::cout << element << ' ';
std::cout << "} ";
};
 
int main()
{
constexpr static auto source = {0, 1, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 6, 0, 7, 8, 9};
constexpr int delimiter{0};
constexpr std::ranges::lazy_split_view outer_view{source, delimiter};
std::cout << "splits[" << std::ranges::distance(outer_view) << "]: ";
for (auto const& inner_view: outer_view)
print(inner_view);
 
constexpr std::string_view hello{"Hello C++ 20 !"};
std::cout << "\n" "substrings: ";
std::ranges::for_each(hello | std::views::lazy_split(' '), print);
 
constexpr std::string_view text{"Hello-+-C++-+-20-+-!"};
constexpr std::string_view delim{"-+-"};
std::cout << "\n" "substrings: ";
std::ranges::for_each(text | std::views::lazy_split(delim), print);
}

Output:

splits[5]: { } { 1 } { 2 3 } { 4 5 6 } { 7 8 9 }
substrings: { H e l l o } { C + + } { 2 0 } { ! }
substrings: { H e l l o } { C + + } { 2 0 } { ! }
