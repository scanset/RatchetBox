Call signature

template< class T >

    requires /* see below */

constexpr /* see below */ cdata( T&& t );

(since C++20)

Returns a pointer to the first element of constant type(since C++23) of a contiguous range denoted by a const-qualified(until C++23) argument.

Let CT be

- const std::remove_reference_t<T>& if the argument is an lvalue (i.e. T is an lvalue reference type),

- const T otherwise.

A call to ranges::cdata is expression-equivalent to ranges::data(static_cast<CT&&>(t)).

The return type is equivalent to std::remove_reference_t<ranges::range_reference_t<CT>>*.

(until C++23)

If the argument is an lvalue or ranges::enable_borrowed_range<std::remove_cv_t<T>> is true, then a call to ranges::cdata is expression-equivalent to:

- as-const-pointer(ranges::data(possibly-const-range(t))).

The return type is equivalent to std::remove_reference_t<ranges::range_const_reference_t<T>>*.

In all other cases, a call to ranges::cdata is ill-formed, which can result in substitution failure when the call appears in the immediate context of a template instantiation.

(since C++23)

If ranges::cdata(t) is valid, then it returns a pointer to an object of constant type(since C++23).

### Customization point objects

The name ranges::cdata denotes a customization point object, which is a const function object of a literal semiregular class type. For exposition purposes, the cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted as __cdata_fn.

All instances of __cdata_fn are equal. The effects of invoking different instances of type __cdata_fn on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be invocable). Thus, ranges::cdata can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to ranges::cdata above, __cdata_fn models

- std::invocable<__cdata_fn, Args...>,

- std::invocable<const __cdata_fn, Args...>,

- std::invocable<__cdata_fn&, Args...>, and

- std::invocable<const __cdata_fn&, Args...>.

Otherwise, no function call operator of __cdata_fn participates in overload resolution.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::string src {"hello world!\n"};
 
// std::ranges::cdata(src)[0] = 'H'; // error, src.data() is treated as read-only
std::ranges::data(src)[0] = 'H'; // OK, src.data() is a non-const storage
 
char dst[20]; // storage for a C-style string
std::strcpy(dst, std::ranges::cdata(src));
// [data(src), data(src) + size(src)] is guaranteed to be an NTBS
 
std::cout << dst;
}

Output:

Hello world!
