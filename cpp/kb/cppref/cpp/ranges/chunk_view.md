chunk_view takes a view and a number n and produces a range of views (the chunks) of the original view, such that each chunk, except maybe the last one, has the size n. These chunks are non-overlapping, successive sub-ranges of the elements of the original view, in order.

Let s be the size of the original view. If s is not the multiple of n, the size of the last produced view is exactly s % n (the remainder). Otherwise, the size of each chunk, including the last one, is n.

The size of produced view is /*div-ceil*/(s).

If the n is not greater than ​0​ the behavior is undefined.

1) An implementation that supports the underlying view V that models only input_range.

2) A partial specialization that supports the underlying view V that models forward_range or stronger. Models common_range if the underlying view V is forward_range, common_range, and either sized_range or non bidirectional_range.

3) The name views::chunk denotes a RangeAdaptorObject. Given subexpressions e and n, the expression views::chunk(e, n) is expression-equivalent to chunk_view(e, n).

4) Computes the smallest integer value that is not less than the quotient of dividing num by denom. Equivalent to:
I r = num / denom;
if (num % denom)
++r;
return r;

### Data members

Member object

Definition

base_ (private)

The underlying view of type V.
(exposition-only member object*)

n_ (private)

The "chunk size" of type ranges::range_difference_t<V>.
(exposition-only member object*)

#### If V models exactly input_range (1) 

remainder_ (private) 
(conditionally present)

The number of elements left in the current chunk, of type ranges::range_difference_t<V>.
(exposition-only member object*)

current_ (private) 
(conditionally present)

An optional-like object of type /*non-propagating-cache*/<ranges::iterator_t<V>> that caches current underlying iterator.
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a chunk_view 
(public member function)

base

returns a copy of the underlying (adapted) view 
(public member function)

begin

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

end

returns an iterator or a sentinel to the end 
(public member function)

size

returns the number of elements. Provided only if the underlying (adapted) range satisfies sized_range. 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

back

returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies bidirectional_range and common_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator[]

returns the nth element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies random_access_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Deduction guides

### Nested classes

outer_iterator

(C++23)

the output ("chunk-wise") iterator type when V models input_range (1)
(exposition-only member class*)

inner_iterator

(C++23)

the inner ("element-wise") iterator type when V models input_range (1)
(exposition-only member class*)

iterator

(C++23)

the iterator type when V models forward_range (2)
(exposition-only member class template*)

### Helper templates

template< class V >

constexpr bool ranges::enable_borrowed_range<chunk_view<V>> =

ranges::forward_range<V> && ranges::enable_borrowed_range<V>;

(since C++23)

This specialization of ranges::enable_borrowed_range makes chunk_view satisfy borrowed_range when the underlying view V satisfies both, the forward_range and the borrowed_range.

### Notes

If V models input_range (1), chunk_view's iterator has a dedicated type: outer_iterator::value_type that is itself an input view.

If V models forward_range or stronger (2), chunk_view defers to views::take for its value_type.

If V models bidirectional_range or stronger ranges (2), the need to calculate size the last chunk correctly (from the end iterator) requires the underlying range type V to be sized_range.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
 
auto print_subrange = [](std::ranges::viewable_range auto&& r)
{
std::cout << '[';
for (int pos{}; auto elem : r)
std::cout << (pos++ ? " " : "") << elem;
std::cout << "] ";
};
 
int main()
{
const auto v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
 
for (const unsigned width : std::views::iota(1U, 2U + v.size()))
{
auto const chunks = v | std::views::chunk(width);
std::cout << "chunk(" << width << "): ";
std::ranges::for_each(chunks, print_subrange);
std::cout << '\n';
}
}

Output:

chunk(1): [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
chunk(2): [1 2] [3 4] [5 6]
chunk(3): [1 2 3] [4 5 6]
chunk(4): [1 2 3 4] [5 6]
chunk(5): [1 2 3 4 5] [6]
chunk(6): [1 2 3 4 5 6]
chunk(7): [1 2 3 4 5 6]
