struct /*iterator*/;

(exposition only*)

ranges::basic_istream_view<Val, CharT, Traits>::iterator is the type of the iterators returned by begin() of ranges::basic_istream_view<Val, CharT, Traits>.

iterator is an input_iterator, but does not satisfy LegacyInputIterator, and thus does not work with pre-C++20 algorithms.

### Member functions

## std::ranges::basic_istream_view::iterator::iterator

/*iterator*/( const /*iterator*/& ) = delete;

(1)
(since C++20)

/*iterator*/( /*iterator*/&& ) = default;

(2)
(since C++20)

constexpr explicit /*iterator*/( basic_istream_view& parent );

(3)
(since C++20)

1) The copy constructor is deleted. The iterator is not copyable.

2) The move constructor is defaulted.

3) Initializes parent_ with std::addressof(parent).

## std::ranges::basic_istream_view::iterator::operator=

/*iterator*/& operator=( const /*iterator*/& ) = delete;

(1)
(since C++20)

/*iterator*/& operator=( /*iterator*/&& ) = default;

(2)
(since C++20)

1) The copy assignment operator is deleted. The iterator is not copyable.

2) The move assignment operator is defaulted.

## std::ranges::basic_istream_view::iterator::operator++

/*iterator*/& operator++();

(1)
(since C++20)

void operator++(int);

(2)
(since C++20)

1) Equivalent to *parent_ ﻿->stream_ >> parent_ ﻿->value_.

2) Equivalent to ++*this.

## std::ranges::basic_istream_view::iterator::operator*

Val& operator*() const;

(since C++20)

Returns parent_ ﻿->value_.

### Non-member functions

## operator==(std::ranges::basic_istream_view::iterator, std::default_sentinel)

friend bool operator==( const /*iterator*/& x, std::default_sentinel_t );

(since C++20)

Returns !*parent_ ﻿->stream_.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::ranges::basic_istream_view::iterator is an associated class of the arguments.
