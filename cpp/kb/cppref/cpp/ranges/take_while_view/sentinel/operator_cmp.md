friend constexpr bool operator==( const ranges::iterator_t<Base>& x,

                                  const /*sentinel*/& y );

(since C++20)

Compares a take_while_view::/*sentinel*/ with an iterator into (possibly const-qualified) view V. The iterator is typically obtained from a call to take_while_view::begin.

Returns true if x compares equal to the underlying sentinel of y (i.e. y.base()), or if the predicate returns false when applied to *x.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when take_while_view::sentinel<Const> is an associated class of the arguments.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

### Parameters

x

-

iterator to compare

y

-

sentinel to compare

### Return value

y.end_ == x | !std::invoke(*y.pred_, *x), where end_ denotes the stored sentinel and pred_ denotes the stored pointer to predicate.
