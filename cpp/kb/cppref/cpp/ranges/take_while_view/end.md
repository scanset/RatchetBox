constexpr auto end() const requires

    ranges::range<const V> &&

std::indirect_unary_predicate<const Pred, ranges::iterator_t<const V>>;

(2)
(since C++20)

Returns a sentinel representing the end of the view.

Let base_ denote the underlying view.

1) Effectively returns /*sentinel*/<false>(ranges::end(base_), std::addressof(pred())).

2) Effectively returns /*sentinel*/<true>(ranges::end(base_), std::addressof(pred())).

Overload (1) does not participate in overload resolution if V is a simple view (that is, if V and const V are views with the same iterator and sentinel types).
