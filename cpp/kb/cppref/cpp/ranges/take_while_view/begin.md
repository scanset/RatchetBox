constexpr auto begin() const requires

    ranges::range<const V> &&

std::indirect_unary_predicate<const Pred, ranges::iterator_t<const V>>;

(2)
(since C++20)

Returns an iterator to the first element of the view. Effectively calls ranges::begin on the underlying view base_.

Overload (1) does not participate in overload resolution if V is a simple view (that is, if V and const V are views with the same iterator and sentinel types).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

ranges::begin(base_), where base_ is the underlying view.
