Advances or decrements the iterator.

Let current_ and last_ele_ be the underlying iterators to the begin and end of the sliding window.

1) Equivalent to:
current_ = ranges::next(current_);
last_ele_ = ranges::next(last_ele_); // if last_ele_ is present
return *this;

Before the invocation, the current_ and last_ele_ (if present) must be incrementable.

2) Equivalent to: auto tmp = *this; ++*this; return tmp;

3) Equivalent to:
current_ = ranges::prev(current_);
last_ele_ = ranges::prev(last_ele_); // if last_ele_ is present
return *this;

Before the invocation, the current_ and last_ele_ (if present) must be decrementable.

4) Equivalent to: auto tmp = *this; --*this; return tmp;

5) Equivalent to:
current_ = current_ + n;
last_ele_ = last_ele_ + n; // if last_ele_ is present
return *this;

Before the invocation, the expressions current_ + n and last_ele_ + n (if last_ele_ is present) must have well-defined behavior.

6) Equivalent to:
current_ = current_ - n;
last_ele_ = last_ele_ - n; // if last_ele_ is present
return *this;

Before the invocation, the expressions current_ - n and last_ele_ - n (if last_ele_ is present) must have well-defined behavior.

### Parameters

n

-

position relative to current location

### Return value

2,4) a copy of *this that was made before the change
