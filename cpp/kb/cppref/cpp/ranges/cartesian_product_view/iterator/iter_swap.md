friend constexpr void iter_swap( const /*iterator*/& x, const /*iterator*/& y )

    noexcept (/* see description */)

    requires (std::indirectly_swappable<

        ranges::iterator_t</*maybe-const*/<Const, First>>> and ... and

std::indirectly_swappable<ranges::iterator_t</*maybe-const*/<Const, Vs>>>);

(since C++23)

Applies ranges::iter_swap to the stored underlying iterators. Formally, for every integer 0 ≤ i ≤ sizeof...(Vs), performs ranges::iter_swap(std::get<i>(x.current_), std::get<i>(y.current_)), where current_ is the underlying tuple of iterators.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when cartesian_product_view::iterator<Const> is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

x, y

-

iterators to the elements to swap

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

The exception specification is equivalent to the logical AND of the expression noexcept(ranges::iter_swap(std::get<i>(x.current_), std::get<i>(y.current_))) for every integer 0 ≤ i ≤ sizeof...(Vs).
