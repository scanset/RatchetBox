friend constexpr auto iter_move( const /*iterator*/& i ) noexcept(/* see below */)

(since C++23)

Let current_ be the underlying tuple of iterators.

Equivalent to: return /*tuple-transform*/(ranges::iter_move, i.current_);

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when cartesian_product_view::iterator<Const> is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

i

-

iterator

### Return value

A tuple that contains the result of applying ranges::iter_move to the stored underlying iterators converted to the return type, as described above.

### Exceptions

The exception specification is equivalent to the logical AND of the following expressions:

- noexcept(ranges::iter_move(std::get<N>(i.current_))) for every integer 0 ≤ N ≤ sizeof...(Vs),

- std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<ranges::range_rvalue_reference_t</*maybe-const*/<Const, T>>> for every type T in First, Vs....
