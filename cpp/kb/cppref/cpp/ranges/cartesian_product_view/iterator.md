class /*iterator*/

(since C++23) 
(exposition only*)

The return type of cartesian_product_view::begin, and of cartesian_product_view::end when the underlying view V is a common_range.

The type /*iterator*/<true> is returned by the const-qualified overloads. The type /*iterator*/<false> is returned by the non-const-qualified overloads.

reference

difference_type

An implementation-defined signed-integer-like type (maybe the smallest of such types), which is sufficiently wide to store the product of the maximum sizes of all underlying ranges, if such type exists.

### Data members

Member

Definition

Parent* parent_ (private)

A pointer to the parent object cartesian_product_view
(exposition-only member object*)

current_ (private)

A tuple of iterators to the current underlying elements of type std::tuple<ranges::iterator_t</*maybe-const*/<Const, First>>,
           ranges::iterator_t</*maybe-const*/<Const, Vs>>...>
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs an iterator 
(public member function)

operator*

accesses the element 
(public member function)

operator[]

accesses an element by index 
(public member function)

operator++operator++(int)operator--operator--(int)operator+=operator-=

advances or decrements the underlying iterator 
(public member function)

next

advances the iterator
(exposition-only member function*)

prev

decrements the iterator
(exposition-only member function*)

distance_from

returns the distance between two iterators
(exposition-only member function*)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator<=>

(C++23)

compares the underlying iterators 
(function)

operator+operator-

(C++23)

performs iterator arithmetic 
(function)

iter_move

(C++23)

casts the result of dereferencing the underlying iterator to its associated rvalue reference type 
(function)

iter_swap

(C++23)

swaps underlying pointed-to elements 
(function)
