friend constexpr bool operator==( const /*iterator*/<Const>& x, const /*sentinel*/& y );

(since C++20)

Compares the underlying iterator of x with the underlying sentinel of y.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when transform_view::sentinel<Const> is an associated class of the arguments.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

### Parameters

x

-

iterator to compare

y

-

sentinel to compare

### Return value

x.current_ == y.end_, where current_ denotes the underlying iterator, end_ denotes the underlying sentinel.
