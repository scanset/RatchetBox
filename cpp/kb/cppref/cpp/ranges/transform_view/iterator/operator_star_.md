constexpr decltype(auto) operator*() const;

(since C++20)

Returns the transformed element.

Effectively returns std::invoke(*parent_->fun_, *current_), where *parent_->fun_ is the transformation function stored in the parent transform_view, and current_ is the underlying iterator into V.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The transformed element.

### Notes

operator-> is not provided.

The behavior is undefined if the pointer to parent transform_view is null (e.g. if *this is default constructed).

If *current_ is a prvalue, its lifetime ends before this function returns. If the transformation function returns a reference or pointer to it, the result would dangle.
