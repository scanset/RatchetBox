template< bool Const >

class /*iterator*/

(since C++23) 
(exposition only*)

The return type of chunk_view::begin, and of chunk_view::end when the underlying view V is a common_range.

Present only if V models forward_range.

The type /*iterator*/<true> is returned by the const-qualified overloads. The type /*iterator*/<false> is returned by the non-const-qualified overloads.

### Member types

Member type

Definition

Parent (private)

const chunk_view if Const is true, otherwise chunk_view.
(exposition-only member type*)

Base (private)

const V if Const is true, otherwise V.
(exposition-only member type*)

iterator_category

std::input_iterator_tag

iterator_concept

- std::random_access_iterator_tag, if Base models random_access_range. Otherwise,

- std::bidirectional_iterator_tag, if Base models bidirectional_range. Otherwise,

- std::forward_iterator_tag.

value_type

decltype(views::take(ranges::subrange(current_, end_), n_));.

difference_type

ranges::range_difference_t<Base>

### Data members

Member name

Definition

current_ (private)

ranges::iterator_t<Base>, holds an iterator to the first element of current chunk in the underlying sequence (i.e. the begin of a chunk).
(exposition-only member object*)

end_ (private)

ranges::sentinel_t<Base>, holds a sentinel to the end of the underlying sequence.
(exposition-only member object*)

n_ (private)

ranges::range_difference_t<Base>, holds initial number of elements in the chunk (the last chunk can be smaller).
(exposition-only member object*)

missing_ (private)

ranges::range_difference_t<Base>, usually equals to ranges::advance(current_, n_, end_);.
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs an iterator 
(public member function)

base

returns an iterator to current element 
(public member function)

operator*

accesses the element 
(public member function)

operator[]

accesses an element by index 
(public member function)

operator++operator++(int)operator--operator--(int)operator+=operator-=

advances or decrements the underlying iterator 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator<operator>operator<=operator>=operator<=>

(C++23)

compares the underlying iterators 
(function)

operator+operator-

(C++23)

performs iterator arithmetic 
(function)
