friend constexpr bool

    operator==( const /*outer-iterator*/& x, std::default_sentinel_t );

(since C++23)

Compares the iterator and the sentinel.

Let parent_ be the underlying pointer to enclosing chunk_view. Equivalent to:

return *x.parent_->current_ == ranges::end(x.parent_->base_) and x.parent_->remainder_ != 0;

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::ranges::chunk_view::outer-iterator is an associated class of the arguments.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

### Parameters

x

-

iterator to compare

### Return value

The result of comparison.
