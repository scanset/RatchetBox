constexpr auto size() requires ranges::forward_range<D> &&

constexpr auto size() const requires ranges::forward_range<const D> &&

    std::sized_sentinel_for<ranges::sentinel_t<const D>,

ranges::iterator_t<const D>>;

(2)
(since C++20)

The default implementation of size() member function obtains the size of the range by calculating the difference between the sentinel and the beginning iterator.

### Return value

1) to-unsigned-like ﻿(ranges::end(static_cast<D&>(this)) -
                     ranges::begin(static_cast<D&>(this))).

2) to-unsigned-like ﻿(ranges::end(static_cast<const D&>(this)) -
                     ranges::begin(static_cast<const D&>(this))).

### Notes

Following derived types may use the default implementation of size():

- std::ranges::drop_while_view

Following types are derived from std::ranges::view_interface and do not declare their own size() member function, but they cannot use the default implementation, because their iterator and sentinel types never satisfy sized_sentinel_for:

- std::ranges::basic_istream_view

- std::ranges::filter_view

- std::ranges::join_view

- std::ranges::lazy_split_view

- std::ranges::split_view

- std::ranges::take_while_view
