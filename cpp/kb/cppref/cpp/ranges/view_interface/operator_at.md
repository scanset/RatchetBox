template<ranges::random_access_range R = D>

constexpr decltype(auto) operator[]( ranges::range_difference_t<R> n );

(1)
(since C++20)

template<ranges::random_access_range R = const D>

constexpr decltype(auto) operator[]( ranges::range_difference_t<R> n ) const;

(2)
(since C++20)

The default implementation of operator[] member function obtains the element at the specified offset relative to the beginning iterator, reusing the operator[] of the iterator type.

1) Let derived be static_cast<D&>(*this). Equivalent to return ranges::begin(derived)[n];.

2) Same as (1), except that derived is static_cast<const D&>(*this).

### Parameters

n

-

position of the element to return

### Return value

The element at offset n relative to the beginning iterator.

### Notes

In C++20, no type derived from std::ranges::view_interface in the standard library provides their own operator[] member function.

However, following derived types cannot use the default implementations, as they never satisfy random_access_range:

- std::ranges::basic_istream_view

- std::ranges::filter_view

- std::ranges::join_view

- std::ranges::lazy_split_view

- std::ranges::split_view

The inherited operator[] member function is available for std::ranges::empty_view, but a call to it always results in undefined behavior.
