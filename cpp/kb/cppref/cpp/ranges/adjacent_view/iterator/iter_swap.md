friend constexpr void iter_swap( const /*iterator*/& x, const /*iterator*/& y )

    noexcept( /*see below*/ )

requires std::indirectly_swappable<ranges::iterator_t<Base>>;

(since C++23)

Swaps the objects pointed to by two underlying arrays of iterators (denoted as current_).

Equivalent to: 

for (std::size_t i{}; i != N; ++i)
{
std::ranges::iter_swap(x.current_[i], y.current_[i]);
}

The behavior is undefined if before the operation none of the iterators in x.current_ is equal to an iterator in y.current_.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when adjacent_view::iterator<Const> is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

-

iterators

### Return value
