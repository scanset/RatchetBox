static std::size_t length( const char_type* s );

(constexpr since C++17)

Returns the length of the character sequence pointed to by s, that is, the position of the terminating null character (char_type()).

See CharTraits for the general requirements on character traits for X::length.

### Parameters

s

-

pointer to a character sequence to return length of

### Return value

The length of character sequence pointed to by s.

### Complexity

Linear.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
void print(const char* str)
{
std::cout << std::quoted(str) << " has length = "
<< std::char_traits<char>::length(str) << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
print("foo");
 
std::string s{"booo"};
print(s.c_str());
}

Output:

"foo" has length = 3
"booo" has length = 4
