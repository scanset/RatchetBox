static void assign( char_type& c1, const char_type& c2 );

(1)
(noexcept since C++11)
(constexpr since C++17)

static char_type* assign( char_type* ptr, std::size_t count, char_type c2 );

(2)
(constexpr since C++20)

1) Assigns c2 to c1, behaves identically to c1 = c2.

2) Assigns c2 to each character in count characters in the character sequence pointed to by ptr.

See CharTraits for the general requirements on character traits for X::assign.

### Parameters

c1

-

character to assign to

c2

-

character value to assign

ptr

-

pointer to a character sequence to assign to

count

-

the length of the character sequence

### Return value

1) (none)

2) ptr

### Complexity

1) Constant.

2) Linear in count.
