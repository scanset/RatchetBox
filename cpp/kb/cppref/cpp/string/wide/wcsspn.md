Defined in header <cwchar>

size_t wcsspn( const wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src );

Returns the length of the maximum initial segment of the wide string pointed to by dest, that consists of only the characters found in wide string pointed to by src.

### Parameters

dest

-

pointer to the null-terminated wide string to be analyzed

src

-

pointer to the null-terminated wide string that contains the characters to search for

### Return value

The length of the maximum initial segment that contains only characters from wide string pointed to by src.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cwchar>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
wchar_t dest[] = L"白猫 黑狗 甲虫";
const wchar_t src[] = L" 狗猫 白黑 ";
const std::size_t len = std::wcsspn(dest, src);
dest[len] = L'\0'; // terminates the segment to print it out
 
std::wcout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
std::wcout << L"The length of maximum initial segment is " << len << L".\n";
std::wcout << L"The segment is \"" << dest << L"\".\n";
}

Possible output:

The length of maximum initial segment is 6.
The segment is "白猫 黑狗 ".
