Defined in header <cstring>

const char* strpbrk( const char* dest, const char* breakset );

char* strpbrk(       char* dest, const char* breakset );

Scans the null-terminated byte string pointed to by dest for any character from the null-terminated byte string pointed to by breakset, and returns a pointer to that character.

### Parameters

dest

-

pointer to the null-terminated byte string to be analyzed

breakset

-

pointer to the null-terminated byte string that contains the characters to search for

### Return value

Pointer to the first character in dest, that is also in breakset, or null pointer if no such character exists.

### Notes

The name stands for "string pointer break", because it returns a pointer to the first of the separator ("break") characters.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstring>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
const char* str = "hello world, friend of mine!";
const char* sep = " ,!";
 
unsigned int cnt = 0;
do
{
str = std::strpbrk(str, sep); // find separator
std::cout << std::quoted(str) << '\n';
if (str)
str += std::strspn(str, sep); // skip separator
++cnt; // increment word count
} while (str && *str);
 
std::cout << "There are " << cnt << " words\n";
}

Output:

" world, friend of mine!"
", friend of mine!"
" of mine!"
" mine!"
"!"
There are 5 words
