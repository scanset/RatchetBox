Defined in header <cstring>

const char* strchr( const char* str, int ch );

char* strchr(       char* str, int ch );

Finds the first occurrence of the character static_cast<char>(ch) in the byte string pointed to by str. 

The terminating null character is considered to be a part of the string and can be found if searching for '\0'.

### Parameters

str

-

pointer to the null-terminated byte string to be analyzed

ch

-

character to search for

### Return value

Pointer to the found character in str, or a null pointer if no such character is found.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
const char* str = "Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.";
char target = 'T';
const char* result = str;
 
while ((result = std::strchr(result, target)) != nullptr)
{
std::cout << "Found '" << target
<< "' starting at '" << result << "'\n";
 
// Increment result, otherwise we'll find target at the same location
++result;
}
}

Output:

Found 'T' starting at 'Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.'
Found 'T' starting at 'There is no try.'
