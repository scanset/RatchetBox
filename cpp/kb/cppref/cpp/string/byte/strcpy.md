Defined in header <cstring>

char* strcpy( char* dest, const char* src );

Copies the character string pointed to by src, including the null terminator, to the character array whose first element is pointed to by dest.

The behavior is undefined if the dest array is not large enough. The behavior is undefined if the strings overlap.

### Parameters

dest

-

pointer to the character array to write to

src

-

pointer to the null-terminated byte string to copy from

### Return value

dest

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
int main()
{
const char* src = "Take the test.";
// src[0] = 'M'; // can't modify string literal
auto dst = std::make_unique<char[]>(std::strlen(src) + 1); // +1 for null terminator
std::strcpy(dst.get(), src);
dst[0] = 'M';
std::cout << src << '\n' << dst.get() << '\n';
}

Output:

Take the test.
Make the test.
