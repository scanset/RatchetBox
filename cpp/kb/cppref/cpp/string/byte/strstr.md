Defined in header <cstring>

const char* strstr( const char* haystack, const char* needle );

char* strstr(       char* haystack, const char* needle );

Finds the first occurrence of the byte string needle in the byte string pointed to by haystack. The terminating null characters are not compared.

### Parameters

haystack

-

pointer to the null-terminated byte string to examine

needle

-

pointer to the null-terminated byte string to search for

### Return value

Pointer to the first character of the found substring in haystack, or a null pointer if no such character is found. If needle points to an empty string, haystack is returned.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstring>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
const char* str = "Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.";
const char* target = "not";
 
for (const char* result = str; (result = std::strstr(result, target)); ++result)
std::cout << "Found " << std::quoted(target)
<< " starting at (" << result - str << "): "
<< std::quoted(result) << '\n';
}

Output:

Found "not" starting at (4): "not. Do, or do not. There is no try."
Found "not" starting at (19): "not. There is no try."
