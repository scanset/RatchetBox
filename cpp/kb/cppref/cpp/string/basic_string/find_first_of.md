(since C++17) 
(constexpr since C++20)

Finds the first character equal to one of the characters in the given character sequence. The search considers only the range [pos, size()). If none of the characters in the given character sequence is present in the range, npos will be returned.

1) Finds the first character equal to one of the characters in str.

2) Finds the first character equal to one of the characters in the range [s, s + count). This range can include null characters.

If [s, s + count) is not a valid range, the behavior is undefined.

3) Finds the first character equal to one of the characters in character string pointed to by s. The length of the string is determined by the first null character using Traits::length(s).

If [s, s + Traits::length(s)) is not a valid range, the behavior is undefined.

4) Finds the first character equal to ch.

5) Implicitly converts t to a string view sv as if by std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits> sv = t;, then finds the first character equal to one of the characters in sv.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_convertible_v<const StringViewLike&,
                      std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>> is true and std::is_convertible_v<const StringViewLike&, const CharT*> is false.

### Parameters

str

-

string identifying characters to search for

pos

-

position at which to begin searching

count

-

length of character string identifying characters to search for

s

-

pointer to a character string identifying characters to search for

ch

-

character to search for

t

-

object (convertible to std::basic_string_view) identifying characters to search for

### Return value

Position of the found character or npos if no such character is found.

### Exceptions

1,4) Throws nothing.

5) noexcept specification:  
noexcept(std::is_nothrow_convertible_v<const T&, std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>>)

If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Notes

Traits::eq() is used to perform the comparison.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>
 
int main()
{
using namespace std::literals;
std::string::size_type sz;
 
// (1)
sz = "alignas"s.find_first_of("klmn"s);
// └────────────────────────┘
assert(sz == 1);
 
sz = "alignof"s.find_first_of("wxyz"s);
// no match
assert(sz == std::string::npos);
 
// (2)
sz = "consteval"s.find_first_of("xyzabc", 0, 3);
// no match (× are not targets) ×××
assert(sz == std::string::npos);
 
sz = "consteval"s.find_first_of("xyzabc", 0, 6);
// └───────────────────────────────┘
assert(sz == 0);
 
// (3)
sz = "decltype"s.find_first_of("xyzabc");
// └────────────────────────────┘
assert(sz == 2);
 
// (4)
sz = "co_await"s.find_first_of('a');
// └──────────────────────┘
assert(sz == 3);
 
// (5)
sz = "constinit"s.find_first_of("int"sv);
// └─────────────────────────┘
assert(sz == 2);
 
std::cout << "All tests passed.\n";
}

Output:

All tests passed.
