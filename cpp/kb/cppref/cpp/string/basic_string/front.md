CharT& front();

(1)
(constexpr since C++20)

const CharT& front() const;

(2)
(constexpr since C++20)

Returns reference to the first character in the string. The behavior is undefined if empty() is true.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Reference to the first character, equivalent to operator[](0).

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

In libstdc++, front() is not available in C++98 mode.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::string s("Exemplary");
char& f1 = s.front();
f1 = 'e';
std::cout << s << '\n'; // "exemplary"
 
std::string const c("Exemplary");
char const& f2 = c.front();
std::cout << &f2 << '\n'; // "Exemplary"
}

Output:

exemplary
Exemplary
