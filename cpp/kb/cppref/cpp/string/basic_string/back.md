CharT& back();

(1)
(constexpr since C++20)

const CharT& back() const;

(2)
(constexpr since C++20)

Returns reference to the last character in the string. The behavior is undefined if empty() is true.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Reference to the last character, equivalent to operator[](size() - 1).

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

In libstdc++, back() is not available in C++98 mode.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::string s("Exemplary");
char& back1 = s.back();
back1 = 's';
std::cout << s << '\n'; // "Exemplars"
 
std::string const c("Exemplary");
char const& back2 = c.back();
std::cout << back2 << '\n'; // 'y'
}

Output:

Exemplars
y
