(1)

void reserve( size_type new_cap = 0 );

(until C++20)

constexpr void reserve( size_type new_cap );

(since C++20)

void reserve();

(deprecated in C++20) 
(removed in C++26)

1) Informs a std::basic_string object of a planned change in size, so that it can manage the storage allocation appropriately.

- If new_cap is greater than the current capacity(), new storage is allocated, and capacity() is made equal or greater than new_cap.

- If new_cap is less than the current capacity(), this is a non-binding shrink request.

- If new_cap is less than the current size(), this is a non-binding shrink-to-fit request equivalent to shrink_to_fit()(since C++11).

(until C++20)

- If new_cap is less than or equal to the current capacity(), there is no effect.

(since C++20)

If a capacity change takes place, all iterators and references, including the past-the-end iterator, are invalidated. 

2) A non-binding shrink-to-fit request. After this call, capacity() has an unspecified value greater than or equal to size().

### Parameters

new_cap

-

new capacity of the string

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

Throws std::length_error if new_cap is greater than max_size().

May throw any exceptions thrown by std::allocator_traits<Allocator>::allocate(), such as std::bad_alloc.

If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Complexity

At most linear in the size() of the string.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::string s;
std::cout << "1) Initially: " << s.capacity() << '\n';
 
const std::string::size_type new_cap{101u};
s.reserve(new_cap);
assert(s.capacity() >= new_cap);
std::cout << "2) After reserve(" << new_cap << "): " << s.capacity() << '\n';
 
// observing the capacity growth factor
auto cap{s.capacity()};
for (int check{}; check != 4; ++check)
{
while (cap == s.capacity())
s += '$';
cap = s.capacity();
std::cout << (3) + check << ") Capacity: " << cap << '\n';
}
 
// s.reserve(); // deprecated/removed in C++20/26, use:
s.shrink_to_fit();
std::cout << "7) After shrink_to_fit: " << s.capacity() << '\n';
}

Possible output:

1) Initially: 15
2) After reserve(101): 101
3) Capacity: 202
4) Capacity: 404
5) Capacity: 808
6) Capacity: 1616
7) After shrink_to_fit: 809
