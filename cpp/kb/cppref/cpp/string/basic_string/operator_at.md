CharT& operator[]( size_type pos );

(1)
(constexpr since C++20)

const CharT& operator[]( size_type pos ) const;

(2)
(constexpr since C++20)

Returns a reference to the character at specified location pos if pos < size(), or a reference to CharT() if pos == size(). No bounds checking is performed.

If pos > size(), the behavior is undefined.

For overload (1), if pos == size(), the behavior is undefined if the object referred by the returned reference is modified to any value other than CharT()(since C++11).

### Parameters

pos

-

position of the character to return

### Return value

Reference to the requested element if pos < size(), or a reference to CharT() if pos == size().

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
const std::string e("Exemplar");
for (unsigned i = e.length() - 1; i != 0; i /= 2)
std::cout << e[i];
std::cout << '\n';
 
const char* c = &e[0];
std::cout << c << '\n'; // print as a C string
 
// Change the last character of s into a 'y'
std::string s("Exemplar ");
s[s.size() - 1] = 'y'; // equivalent to s.back() = 'y';
std::cout << s << '\n';
}

Output:

rmx
Exemplar
Exemplary

Correct behavior

LWG 259

C++98

non-const overload could return const lvalue data()[pos], which was ill-formed

*(begin() + pos)

LWG 2475

if pos == size(), the behavior of modifying the
object referred by the returned reference was undefined

modified to CharT()
