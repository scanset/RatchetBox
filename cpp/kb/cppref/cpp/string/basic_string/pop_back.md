void pop_back();

(constexpr since C++20)

Removes the last character from the string.

Equivalent to erase(end() - 1). The behavior is undefined if the string is empty.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

Throws nothing.

### Notes

In libstdc++, pop_back() is not available in C++98 mode.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::string str("Short string!");
std::cout << "Before: " << std::quoted(str) << '\n';
assert(str.size() == 13);
 
str.pop_back();
std::cout << "After: " << std::quoted(str) << '\n';
assert(str.size() == 12);
 
str.clear();
// str.pop_back(); // undefined behavior
}

Output:

Before: "Short string!"
After: "Short string"
