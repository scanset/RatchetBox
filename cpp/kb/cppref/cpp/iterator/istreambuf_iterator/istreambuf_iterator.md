1,2) Constructs an end-of-stream iterator.

3) Initializes the iterator and stores the value of is.rdbuf() in a data member. If is.rdbuf() is null, then end-of-stream iterator is constructed. 

4) Initializes the iterator and stores the value of s in a data member. If s is null, then end-of-stream iterator is constructed.

5) Effectively call (3) with the streambuf_type* pointer p holds.

6) The copy constructor is trivial and explicitly defaulted.

The copy constructor is effectively implicitly declared and not guaranteed to be trivial.
