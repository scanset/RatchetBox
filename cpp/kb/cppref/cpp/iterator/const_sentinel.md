Defined in header <iterator>

template< std::input_iterator Iter >

class basic_const_iterator;

(since C++23)

std::basic_const_iterator is an iterator adaptor which behaves exactly like the underlying iterator (which must be at least an LegacyInputIterator or model input_iterator), except that dereferencing converts the value returned by the underlying iterator as immutable. Specializations of std::basic_const_iterator are constant iterators, that is, the iterator can never be used as an output iterator because modifying elements is not allowed.

### Member types

Member type

Definition

iterator_category
(conditionally present)

If Iter models forward_iterator:

- member iterator_category is the same type as std::iterator_traits<Iter>::iterator_category.

Otherwise, there is no member iterator_category.

iterator_concept

- std::contiguous_iterator_tag, if Iter models contiguous_iterator;

- std::random_access_iterator_tag, if Iter models random_access_iterator;

- std::bidirectional_iterator_tag, if Iter models bidirectional_iterator;

- std::forward_iterator_tag, if Iter models forward_iterator;

- std::input_iterator_tag otherwise.

value_type

std::iter_value_t<Iter>

difference_type

std::iter_difference_t<Iter>

reference (private)

std::iter_const_reference_t<Iter>
(exposition-only member type*)

### Member objects

Member name

Definition

current (private)

the underlying iterator from which base() copies or moves
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new iterator adaptor 
(public member function)

base

accesses the underlying iterator 
(public member function)

operator*operator->

accesses the pointed-to element 
(public member function)

operator[]

accesses an element by index 
(public member function)

operator++operator++(int)operator+=operator--operator--(int)operator-=

advances or decrements the iterator 
(public member function)

operator constant-iterator

converts into any constant iterator to which an underlying iterator can be convertible 
(public member function)

operator==operator<operator>operator<=operator>=operator<=>

compares the underlying iterators 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator<operator>operator<=operator>=operator<=>

(C++23)

compares basic_const_iterator with non-basic_const_iterator 
(function template)

operator+operator-

(C++23)

advances or decrements the iterator 
(function template)

operator-

(C++23)

computes the distance between two iterator adaptors 
(function template)

iter_move

(C++23)

casts the result of dereferencing the underlying iterator to its associated rvalue reference type 
(function)

### Helper classes

std::common_type<std::basic_const_iterator>

(C++23)

determines the common type of an iterator and an adapted basic_const_iterator type 
(class template specialization)

### Helper alias templates

template< std::input_iterator I >

using const_iterator = /* see description */;

(since C++23)

If I models constant-iterator (an exposition-only concept), then const_iterator<I> denotes a type I. Otherwise, basic_const_iterator<I>.

template< std::semiregular S >

using const_sentinel = /* see description */;

(since C++23)

If S models input_iterator, then const_sentinel<S> denotes a type const_iterator<S>. Otherwise, S.

### Helper function templates

template< std::input_iterator T >

constexpr const_iterator<T> make_const_iterator( I it ) { return it; }

(since C++23)

template< std::semiregular S >

constexpr const_sentinel<S> make_const_sentinel( S s ) { return s; }

(since C++23)

std::basic_const_iterator should follow its underlying type's convertibility

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <iterator>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
std::vector v{1, 2, 3};
std::vector<int>::iterator i = v.begin();
*i = 4; // OK, v[0] == 4 now
i[1] = 4; // OK, the same as *(i + 1) = 4;
 
auto ci = std::make_const_iterator(i);
assert(*ci == 4); // OK, can read the underlying object
assert(ci[0] == 4); // OK, ditto
// *ci = 13; // Error: location is read-only
// ci[0] = 13; // Error: ditto
ci.base()[0] = 42; // OK, underlying iterator is writable
assert(*ci == 42); // OK, underlying location v[0] was modified
}
