ostreambuf_iterator& operator=( CharT c );

If failed() returns false, inserts the character c into the associated stream buffer by calling pbuf->sputc(c), where pbuf is the private member of type streambuf_type*. Otherwise, does nothing.

If the call to pbuf->sputc(c) returns Traits::eof, sets the failed() flag to true.
