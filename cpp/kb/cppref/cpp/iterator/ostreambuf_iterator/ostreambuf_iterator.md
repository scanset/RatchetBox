(1)

ostreambuf_iterator( streambuf_type* buffer ) throw();

(until C++11)

ostreambuf_iterator( streambuf_type* buffer ) noexcept;

(since C++11)

(2)

ostreambuf_iterator( ostream_type& stream ) throw();

(until C++11)

ostreambuf_iterator( ostream_type& stream ) noexcept;

(since C++11)

1) Constructs the iterator with the private streambuf_type* member set to buffer and the failed() flag set to false. The behavior is undefined if buffer is a null pointer.

2) Same as ostreambuf_iterator(stream.rdbuf()).

### Parameters

stream

-

the output stream whose rdbuf() will be accessed by this iterator

buffer

-

the output stream buffer to be accessed by this iterator

### Example

Run this code

#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
 
int main()
{
const char* file = "test.txt";
{
std::basic_filebuf<char> f;
f.open(file, std::ios::out);
std::ostreambuf_iterator<char> out1(&f);
*out1 = 'a'; // writes to file via iterator
}
 
// read back from the file
char a;
std::cout << ((std::ifstream{file} >> a), a) << std::endl;
 
std::ostreambuf_iterator<wchar_t> out2{std::wcout};
*out2 = L'b';
}

Output:

a
b
