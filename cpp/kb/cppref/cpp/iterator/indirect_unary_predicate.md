concept indirect_unary_predicate =

    std::indirectly_readable<I> &&

    std::copy_constructible<F> &&

    std::predicate<F&, /*indirect-value-t*/<I>> &&

std::predicate<F&, std::iter_reference_t<I>>;

(since C++20)

The concept indirect_unary_predicate specifies requirements for algorithms that call unary predicates as their arguments. The key difference between this concept and std::predicate is that it is applied to the type that I references, rather than I itself.

one of the requirements was defined in terms of std::iter_value_t<I>&
which mishandled projections resulting in incompatibility with predicate F&
