(1)

iterator_type base() const;

(constexpr since C++17) 
(until C++20)

constexpr const iterator_type& base() const& noexcept;

(since C++20)

constexpr iterator_type base() &&;

(2)
(since C++20)

Returns the underlying iterator.

1) Returns a copy of(until C++20)reference to(since C++20) the underlying iterator.

2) Returns an iterator move constructed from the underlying iterator.

### Return value

1) current

2) std::move(current ﻿)

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
std::vector<int> v{0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
std::move_iterator<std::vector<int>::reverse_iterator>
m1{v.rbegin()},
m2{v.rend()};
 
std::copy(m1.base(), m2.base(), std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, " "));
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

4 3 2 1 0
