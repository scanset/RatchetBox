template< class U > 

move_iterator& operator=( const move_iterator<U>& other );

(constexpr since C++17)

Assigns other.current to current ﻿.

If U is not convertible to Iter, the program is ill-formed.

(until C++20)

This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_same_v<U, Iter> is false and both std::convertible_to<const U&, Iter> and std::assignable_from<Iter&, const U&> are modeled.

(since C++20)
