move_iterator();

(1)
(constexpr since C++17)

explicit move_iterator( iterator_type x );

(2)
(constexpr since C++17)

template< class U >

move_iterator( const move_iterator<U>& other );

(3)
(constexpr since C++17)

Constructs a new move_iterator.

Overload 

current

(1)

value-initialized

(2)

 initialized with x(until C++20)std::move(x)(since C++20) 

(3)

initialized with other.current

3) The converting constructor.

If U is not convertible to Iter, the program is ill-formed.

(until C++20)

This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_same_v<U, Iter> is false and std::convertible_to<const U&, Iter> is modeled.

(since C++20)
