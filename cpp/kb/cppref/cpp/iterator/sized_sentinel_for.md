1) The sized_sentinel_for concept specifies that an object of the iterator type I and an object of the sentinel type S can be subtracted to compute the distance between them in constant time.

2) The disable_sized_sentinel_for variable template can be used to prevent iterators and sentinels that can be subtracted but do not actually model sized_sentinel_for from satisfying the concept.

A program may specialize disable_sized_sentinel_for for cv-unqualified non-array object type S and I, as long as at least one of which is a program-defined type. Such specializations are usable in constant expressions and have type const bool.

### Semantic requirements

Let i be an iterator of type I, and s a sentinel of type S such that [i, s) denotes a range. Let n be the smallest number of applications of ++i necessary to make bool(i == s) be true. I and S model sized_sentinel_for<S, I> only if all following conditions are satisfied:

- If n is representable by std::iter_difference_t<I>, then s - i is well-defined and equals n.

- If -n is representable by std::iter_difference_t<I>, then i - s is well-defined and equals -n.

### Equality preservation

Expressions declared in requires expressions of the standard library concepts are required to be equality-preserving (except where stated otherwise).

### Implicit expression variations

A requires expression that uses an expression that is non-modifying for some constant lvalue operand also requires implicit expression variations.
