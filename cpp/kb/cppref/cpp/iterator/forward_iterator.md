Defined in header <iterator>

template< class I >

    concept forward_iterator =

        std::input_iterator<I> &&

        std::derived_from</*ITER_CONCEPT*/<I>, std::forward_iterator_tag> &&

        std::incrementable<I> &&

std::sentinel_for<I, I>;

(since C++20)

This concept refines std::input_iterator by requiring that I also model std::incrementable (thereby making it suitable for multi-pass algorithms), and guaranteeing that two iterators to the same range can be compared against each other.

### Iterator concept determination

Definition of this concept is specified via an exposition-only alias template /*ITER_CONCEPT*/.

In order to determine /*ITER_CONCEPT*/<I>, let ITER_TRAITS<I> denote I if the specialization std::iterator_traits<I> is generated from the primary template, or std::iterator_traits<I> otherwise:

- If ITER_TRAITS<I>::iterator_concept is valid and names a type, /*ITER_CONCEPT*/<I> denotes the type.

- Otherwise, if ITER_TRAITS<I>::iterator_category is valid and names a type, /*ITER_CONCEPT*/<I> denotes the type.

- Otherwise, if std::iterator_traits<I> is generated from the primary template, /*ITER_CONCEPT*/<I> denotes std::random_access_iterator_tag.

- Otherwise, /*ITER_CONCEPT*/<I> does not denote a type and results in a substitution failure.

### Semantic requirements

I models std::forward_iterator if, and only if I models all the concepts it subsumes, and given objects i and j of type I:

- Comparison between iterators i and j has a defined result if

- i and j are iterators to the same underlying sequence, or

- both i and j are value-initialized, in which case they compare equal.

- Pointers and references obtained from a forward iterator into a range remain valid while the range exists.

- If i and j are dereferenceable, they offer the multi-pass guarantee, that is:

- i == j implies ++i == ++j, and

- ((void)[](auto x){ ++x; }(i), *i) is equivalent to *i.

### Notes

Unlike the LegacyForwardIterator requirements, the forward_iterator concept does not require dereference to return a reference.

### Example

A minimum forward iterator.

#include <cstddef>
#include <iterator>
 
struct SimpleForwardIterator
{
using difference_type = std::ptrdiff_t;
using value_type = int;
 
int operator*() const;
 
SimpleForwardIterator& operator++();
 
SimpleForwardIterator operator++(int)
{
auto tmp = *this;
++*this;
return tmp;
}
 
bool operator==(const SimpleForwardIterator&) const;
};
 
static_assert(std::forward_iterator<SimpleForwardIterator>);
