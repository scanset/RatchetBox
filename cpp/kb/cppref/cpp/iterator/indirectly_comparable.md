concept indirectly_comparable =

std::indirect_binary_predicate<Comp, std::projected<I1, Proj1>, std::projected<I2, Proj2>>;

(since C++20)

The concept indirectly_comparable specifies the fundamental algorithm requirement for comparing values across two independent ranges.

### Semantic requirements

indirectly_comparable is modeled only if all concepts it subsumes are modeled.
