template< class I, class Comp = ranges::less, class Proj = std::identity >

concept sortable =

    std::permutable<I> &&

std::indirect_strict_weak_order<Comp, std::projected<I, Proj>>;

(since C++20)

The sortable concept specifies the requirements for algorithms that permute a range into an ordered range according to Comp.

### Semantic requirements

std::sortable<I, Comp, Proj> is modeled only if all concepts it subsumes are modeled.
