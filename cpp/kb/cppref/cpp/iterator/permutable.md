template< class I >

concept permutable =

    std::forward_iterator<I> &&

    std::indirectly_movable_storable<I, I> &&

std::indirectly_swappable<I, I>;

(since C++20)

The concept permutable refines std::forward_iterator by adding requirements for reordering through moves and swaps.

### Semantic requirements

I models permutable only if all concepts it subsumes are modeled.
