(since C++20)

The concept indirect_equivalence_relation specifies requirements for algorithms that call equivalence relations as their arguments. The key difference between this concept and std::equivalence_relation is that it is applied to the types that I1 and I2 references, rather than I1 and I2 themselves.

some requirements were defined in terms of std::iter_value_t<I>&
which mishandled projections resulting in incompatibility with equivalence relation F&

indirect_equivalence_relation required F& to satisfy equivalence_relation with
