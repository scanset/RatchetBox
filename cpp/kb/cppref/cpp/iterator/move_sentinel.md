Defined in header <iterator>

template< std::semiregular S >

class move_sentinel;

(since C++20)

std::move_sentinel is a sentinel adaptor used for denoting ranges together with std::move_iterator.

### Template parameters

S

-

the type of underlying sentinel

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new move_sentinel 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns the contents of one move_sentinel to another 
(public member function)

base

(public member function)

### Member objects

Member name

Definition

last (private)

operator==(std::move_sentinel)

(C++20)

compares the underlying iterator and the underlying sentinel 
(function template)

operator-(std::move_sentinel)

(C++20)
