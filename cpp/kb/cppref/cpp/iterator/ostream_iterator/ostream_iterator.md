ostream_iterator( ostream_type& stream, const CharT* delim );

(1)

ostream_iterator( ostream_type& stream );

(2)

Constructs the iterator with stream as the associated stream, by storing the address of stream.

1) Uses delim as the delimiter.

2) Uses a null pointer as the delimiter.

### Parameters

stream

-

the output stream to be accessed by this iterator

delim

-

the null-terminated character string to be inserted into the stream after each output

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <numeric>
 
int main()
{
std::ostream_iterator<char> oo{std::cout};
std::ostream_iterator<int> i1{std::cout, ", "};
std::fill_n(i1, 5, -1);
*oo++ = '\n';
 
std::ostream_iterator<double> i2{std::cout, "; "};
*i2++ = 3.14;
*i2++ = 2.71;
*oo++ = '\n';
 
std::common_iterator<std::counted_iterator<std::ostream_iterator<float>>,
std::default_sentinel_t>
first{std::counted_iterator{std::ostream_iterator<float>{std::cout," ~ "}, 5}},
last{std::default_sentinel};
std::iota(first, last, 2.2);
*oo++ = '\n';
}

Output:

-1, -1, -1, -1, -1,
3.14; 2.71;
2.2 ~ 3.2 ~ 4.2 ~ 5.2 ~ 6.2 ~
