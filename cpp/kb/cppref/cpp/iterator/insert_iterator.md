(since C++17)

std::insert_iterator is a LegacyOutputIterator that inserts elements into a container for which it was constructed, at the position pointed to by the supplied iterator. The container's insert() member function is called whenever the iterator (whether dereferenced or not) is assigned to. Incrementing the std::insert_iterator is a no-op.

Container

Member types iterator_category, value_type, difference_type, pointer and reference are required to be obtained by inheriting from std::iterator<std::output_iterator_tag, void, void, void, void>.

(until C++17)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new insert_iterator 
(public member function)

operator=

inserts an object into the associated container 
(public member function)

operator*

no-op 
(public member function)

operator++operator++(int)

no-op 
(public member function)

### Member objects

Member name

Definition

container (protected member object)

a pointer of type Container*

iter (protected member object)

an iterator of type Container::iterator(until C++20) ranges::iterator_t<Container>(since C++20)

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <list>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
std::vector<int> v{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
std::list<int> l{-1, -2, -3};
std::copy(v.begin(), v.end(), // may be simplified with std::inserter
std::insert_iterator<std::list<int>>(l, std::next(l.begin()))); 
for (int n : l)
std::cout << n << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

-1 1 2 3 4 5 -2 -3
