Defined in header <mutex>

class recursive_mutex;

(since C++11)

The recursive_mutex class is a synchronization primitive that can be used to protect shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads.

recursive_mutex offers exclusive, recursive ownership semantics:

- A calling thread owns a recursive_mutex for a period of time that starts when it successfully calls either lock or try_lock. During this period, the thread may make additional calls to lock or try_lock. The period of ownership ends when the thread makes a matching number of calls to unlock.

- When a thread owns a recursive_mutex, all other threads will block (for calls to lock) or receive a false return value (for try_lock) if they attempt to claim ownership of the recursive_mutex.

- The maximum number of times that a recursive_mutex may be locked is unspecified, but after that number is reached, calls to lock will throw std::system_error and calls to try_lock will return false.

The behavior of a program is undefined if a recursive_mutex is destroyed while still owned by some thread. The recursive_mutex class satisfies all requirements of Mutex and StandardLayoutType.

### Member types

Member type

Definition

native_handle_type (optional*)

implementation-defined

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs the mutex 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destroys the mutex 
(public member function)

operator=

[deleted]

not copy-assignable 
(public member function)

#### Locking 

lock

locks the mutex, blocks if the mutex is not available 
(public member function)

try_lock

tries to lock the mutex, returns if the mutex is not available 
(public member function)

unlock

unlocks the mutex 
(public member function)

#### Native handle 

native_handle

returns the underlying implementation-defined native handle object 
(public member function)

### Example

One use case for recursive_mutex is protecting shared state in a class whose member functions may call each other.

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
 
class X
{
std::recursive_mutex m;
std::string shared;
public:
void fun1()
{
std::lock_guard<std::recursive_mutex> lk(m);
shared = "fun1";
std::cout << "in fun1, shared variable is now " << shared << '\n';
}
void fun2()
{
std::lock_guard<std::recursive_mutex> lk(m);
shared = "fun2";
std::cout << "in fun2, shared variable is now " << shared << '\n';
fun1(); // recursive lock becomes useful here
std::cout << "back in fun2, shared variable is " << shared << '\n';
}
};
 
int main() 
{
X x;
std::thread t1(&X::fun1, &x);
std::thread t2(&X::fun2, &x);
t1.join();
t2.join();
}

Possible output:

in fun1, shared variable is now fun1
in fun2, shared variable is now fun2
in fun1, shared variable is now fun1
back in fun2, shared variable is fun1
