Defined in header <condition_variable>

class condition_variable_any;

(since C++11)

The condition_variable_any class is a generalization of std::condition_variable. Whereas std::condition_variable works only on std::unique_lock<std::mutex>, condition_variable_any can operate on any lock that meets the BasicLockable requirements.

See std::condition_variable for the description of the semantics of condition variables.

The class std::condition_variable_any is a StandardLayoutType. It is not CopyConstructible, MoveConstructible, CopyAssignable, or MoveAssignable.

If the lock is std::unique_lock<std::mutex>, std::condition_variable may provide better performance.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs the object 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destructs the object 
(public member function)

operator=

[deleted]

not copy-assignable 
(public member function)

#### Notification 

notify_one

notifies one waiting thread 
(public member function)

notify_all

notifies all waiting threads 
(public member function)

#### Waiting 

wait

blocks the current thread until the condition variable is awakened 
(public member function)

wait_for

blocks the current thread until the condition variable is awakened or after the specified timeout duration 
(public member function)

wait_until

blocks the current thread until the condition variable is awakened or until specified time point has been reached 
(public member function)

### Notes

std::condition_variable_any can be used with std::shared_lock in order to wait on a std::shared_mutex in shared ownership mode.

A possible use for std::condition_variable_any with custom Lockable types is to provide convenient interruptible waits: the custom lock operation would both lock the associated mutex as expected, and also perform the necessary setup to notify this condition variable when the interrupting signal is received.[1]
