constexpr mutex() noexcept;

(1)
(since C++11)

mutex( const mutex& ) = delete;

(2)
(since C++11)

1) Constructs the mutex. The mutex is in unlocked state after the constructor completes.

2) Copy constructor is deleted.

### Parameters

(none)

### Notes

Because the default constructor is constexpr, static mutexes are initialized as part of static non-local initialization, before any dynamic non-local initialization begins. This makes it safe to lock a mutex in a constructor of any static object.
