thread() noexcept;

(1)
(since C++11)

thread( thread&& other ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++11)

template< class F, class... Args > 

explicit thread( F&& f, Args&&... args );

(3)
(since C++11)

thread( const thread& ) = delete;

(4)
(since C++11)

Constructs a new std::thread object.

1) Creates a new std::thread object which does not represent a thread.

2) Move constructor. Constructs the std::thread object to represent the thread of execution that was represented by other. After this call other no longer represents a thread of execution.

3) Creates a new std::thread object and associates it with a thread of execution. The new thread of execution starts executing:

INVOKE(decay-copy(std::forward<F>(f)),
       decay-copy(std::forward<Args>(args))...)

(until C++23)

std::invoke(auto(std::forward<F>(f)),

            auto(std::forward<Args>(args))...)

(since C++23)

The calls of decay-copy are evaluated(until C++23)The values produced by auto are materialized(since C++23) in the current thread, so that any exceptions thrown during evaluation and copying/moving of the arguments are thrown in the current thread, without starting the new thread.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::decay<F>::type(until C++20)std::remove_cvref_t<F>(since C++20) is not the same type as std::thread.

If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the program is ill-formed:

- F is not MoveConstructible.

- Any type in Args is not MoveConstructible.

- INVOKE(decay-copy(std::forward<F>(f)),
       decay-copy(std::forward<Args>(args))...) is not a valid expression.

(until C++20)

If any of the following is false, the program is ill-formed:

- std::is_constructible_v<std::decay_t<F>, F>

- (std::is_constructible_v<std::decay_t<Args>, Args> && ...)

- std::is_invocable_v<std::decay_t<F>, std::decay_t<Args>...>

(since C++20)

The completion of the invocation of the constructor synchronizes with the beginning of the invocation of the copy of f on the new thread of execution.

4) The copy constructor is deleted; threads are not copyable. No two std::thread objects may represent the same thread of execution.

### Parameters

other

-

another thread object to construct this thread object with

f

-

Callable object to execute in the new thread

args

-

arguments to pass to the new function

### Postconditions

1) get_id() equal to std::thread::id() (i.e. joinable() is false).

2) other.get_id() equal to std::thread::id() and get_id() returns the value of other.get_id() prior to the start of construction.

3) get_id() not equal to std::thread::id() (i.e. joinable() is true).

### Exceptions

3) std::system_error if the thread could not be started. The exception may represent the error condition std::errc::resource_unavailable_try_again or another implementation-specific error condition.

### Notes

The arguments to the thread function are moved or copied by value. If a reference argument needs to be passed to the thread function, it has to be wrapped (e.g., with std::ref or std::cref).

Any return value from the function is ignored. If the function throws an exception, std::terminate is called. In order to pass return values or exceptions back to the calling thread, std::promise or std::async may be used.

### Example

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <utility>
 
void f1(int n)
{
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
{
std::cout << "Thread 1 executing\n";
++n;
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(10));
}
}
 
void f2(int& n)
{
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
{
std::cout << "Thread 2 executing\n";
++n;
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(10));
}
}
 
class foo
{
public:
void bar()
{
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
{
std::cout << "Thread 3 executing\n";
++n;
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(10));
}
}
int n = 0;
};
 
class baz
{
public:
void operator()()
{
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
{
std::cout << "Thread 4 executing\n";
++n;
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(10));
}
}
int n = 0;
};
 
int main()
{
int n = 0;
foo f;
baz b;
std::thread t1; // t1 is not a thread
std::thread t2(f1, n + 1); // pass by value
std::thread t3(f2, std::ref(n)); // pass by reference
std::thread t4(std::move(t3)); // t4 is now running f2(). t3 is no longer a thread
std::thread t5(&foo::bar, &f); // t5 runs foo::bar() on object f
std::thread t6(b); // t6 runs baz::operator() on a copy of object b
t2.join();
t4.join();
t5.join();
t6.join();
std::cout << "Final value of n is " << n << '\n';
std::cout << "Final value of f.n (foo::n) is " << f.n << '\n';
std::cout << "Final value of b.n (baz::n) is " << b.n << '\n';
}

Possible output:

Thread 1 executing
Thread 2 executing
Thread 3 executing
Thread 4 executing
Thread 3 executing
Thread 1 executing
Thread 2 executing
Thread 4 executing
Thread 2 executing
Thread 3 executing
Thread 1 executing
Thread 4 executing
Thread 3 executing
Thread 2 executing
Thread 1 executing
Thread 4 executing
Thread 3 executing
Thread 1 executing
Thread 2 executing
Thread 4 executing
Final value of n is 5
Final value of f.n (foo::n) is 5
Final value of b.n (baz::n) is 0

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

DR

Applied to

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

LWG 2097

C++11

for overload (3), F could be std::thread

F is constrained

LWG 3476

C++20

overload (3) directly required (the decayed types of)
F and the argument types to be move constructible

removed these
requirements[1]

- ↑ The move-constructibility is already indirectly required by std::is_constructible_v.
