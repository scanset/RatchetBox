Defined in header <thread>

class thread::id;

(since C++11)

The class thread::id is a lightweight, trivially copyable class that serves as a unique identifier of std::thread and std::jthread(since C++20) objects. 

Instances of this class may also hold the special distinct value that does not represent any thread. Once a thread has finished, the value of std::thread::id may be reused by another thread.

This class is designed for use as key in associative containers, both ordered and unordered.
