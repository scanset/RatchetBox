bool joinable() const noexcept;

(since C++11)

Checks if the std::thread object identifies an active thread of execution. Specifically, returns true if get_id() != std::thread::id(). So a default constructed thread is not joinable.

A thread that has finished executing code, but has not yet been joined is still considered an active thread of execution and is therefore joinable.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if the std::thread object identifies an active thread of execution, false otherwise.

### Example

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
using namespace std::chrono_literals;
 
void foo()
{
std::this_thread::sleep_for(500ms);
}
 
int main()
{
std::cout << std::boolalpha;
 
std::thread t;
std::cout << "before starting, joinable: " << t.joinable() << '\n';
 
t = std::thread{foo};
std::cout << "after starting, joinable: " << t.joinable() << '\n';
 
t.join();
std::cout << "after joining, joinable: " << t.joinable() << '\n';
 
t = std::thread{foo};
t.detach();
std::cout << "after detaching, joinable: " << t.joinable() << '\n';
std::this_thread::sleep_for(1500ms);
}

Output:

before starting, joinable: false
after starting, joinable: true
after joining, joinable: false
after detaching, joinable: false
