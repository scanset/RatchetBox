Defined in header <stop_token>

class stop_source;

(since C++20)

The stop_source class provides the means to issue a stop request, such as for std::jthread cancellation. A stop request made for one stop_source object is visible to all stop_sources and std::stop_tokens of the same associated stop-state; any std::stop_callback(s) registered for associated std::stop_token(s) will be invoked, and any std::condition_variable_any objects waiting on associated std::stop_token(s) will be awoken.

Once a stop is requested, it cannot be withdrawn. Additional stop requests have no effect.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs new stop_source object 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destructs the stop_source object 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns the stop_source object 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

request_stop

makes a stop request for the associated stop-state, if any 
(public member function)

swap

swaps two stop_source objects 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

get_token

returns a stop_token for the associated stop-state 
(public member function)

stop_requested

checks whether the associated stop-state has been requested to stop 
(public member function)

stop_possible

checks whether associated stop-state can be requested to stop 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==

(C++20)

compares two std::stop_source objects 
(function)

swap(std::stop_source)

(C++20)

specializes the std::swap algorithm 
(function)

### Helper tags

nostopstatenostopstate_t

(C++20)

a tag used for stop_source to indicate no associated stop-state upon construction
(tag)

### Notes

For the purposes of std::jthread cancellation the stop_source object should be retrieved from the std::jthread object using get_stop_source(); or stop should be requested directly from the std::jthread object using request_stop(). This will then use the same associated stop-state as that passed into the std::jthread's invoked function argument (i.e., the function being executed on its thread).

For other uses, however, a stop_source can be constructed separately using the default constructor, which creates new stop-state.

### Example

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <stop_token>
#include <thread>
 
using namespace std::chrono_literals;
 
void worker_fun(int id, std::stop_token stoken)
{ 
for (int i = 10; i; --i)
{
std::this_thread::sleep_for(300ms);
if (stoken.stop_requested())
{
std::printf(" worker%d is requested to stop\n", id);
return;
}
std::printf(" worker%d goes back to sleep\n", id);
}
}
 
int main()
{
std::jthread threads[4];
std::cout << std::boolalpha;
auto print = [](const std::stop_source& source)
{
std::printf("stop_source stop_possible = %s, stop_requested = %s\n",
source.stop_possible() ? "true" : "false",
source.stop_requested() ? "true" : "false");
};
 
// Common source
std::stop_source stop_source;
 
print(stop_source);
 
// Create worker threads
for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
threads[i] = std::jthread(worker_fun, i + 1, stop_source.get_token());
 
std::this_thread::sleep_for(500ms);
 
std::puts("Request stop");
stop_source.request_stop();
 
print(stop_source);
 
// Note: destructor of jthreads will call join so no need for explicit calls
}

Possible output:

stop_source stop_possible = true, stop_requested = false
worker2 goes back to sleep
worker3 goes back to sleep
worker1 goes back to sleep
worker4 goes back to sleep
Request stop
stop_source stop_possible = true, stop_requested = true
worker3 is requested to stop
worker1 is requested to stop
worker2 is requested to stop
worker4 is requested to stop
