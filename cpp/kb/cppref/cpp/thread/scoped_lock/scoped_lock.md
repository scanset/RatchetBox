explicit scoped_lock( MutexTypes&... m );

(1)
(since C++17)

scoped_lock( std::adopt_lock_t, MutexTypes&... m );

(2)
(since C++17)

scoped_lock( const scoped_lock& ) = delete;

(3)
(since C++17)

Acquires ownership of the given mutexes m.

1) If sizeof...(MutexTypes) == 0, does nothing. Otherwise, if sizeof...(MutexTypes) == 1, effectively calls m.lock(). Otherwise, effectively calls std::lock(m...).

2) Acquires ownership of the mutexes m... without attempting to lock any of them. The behavior is undefined unless the current thread holds a non-shared lock (i.e., a lock acquired by lock, try_lock, try_lock_for, or try_lock_until) on each object in m....

3) Copy constructor is deleted.

The behavior is undefined if m is destroyed before the scoped_lock object is.

### Parameters

m

-

mutexes to acquire ownership of

### Exceptions

1) Throws any exceptions thrown by m.lock().

2) Throws nothing.
