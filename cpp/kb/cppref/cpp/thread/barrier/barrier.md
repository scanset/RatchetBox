constexpr explicit barrier( std::ptrdiff_t expected,

                            CompletionFunction f = CompletionFunction());

(1)
(since C++20)

barrier( const barrier& ) = delete;

(2)
(since C++20)

1) Sets the both initial expected count for each phase and the current expected count for the first phase to expected, initializes the completion function object with std::move(f), and then starts the first phase. The behavior is undefined if expected is negative or greater than max().

2) Copy constructor is deleted. barrier is neither copyable nor movable.

### Parameters

expected

-

initial value of the expected count

f

-

completion function object to be called on phase completion step

### Exceptions

1) Any exception thrown by CompletionFunction's move constructor.

### Notes

expected is permitted to be zero. However, calling any non-static member function other than the destructor on such barrier results in undefined behavior. In other words, such barrier can only be destroyed.
