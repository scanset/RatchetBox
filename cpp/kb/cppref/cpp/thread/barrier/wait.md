void wait( arrival_token&& arrival ) const;

(since C++20)

If arrival is associated with the phase synchronization point for the current phase of *this, blocks at the synchronization point associated with arrival until the phase completion step of the synchronization point's phase is run.

Otherwise, if arrival is associated with the phase synchronization point for the immediately preceding phase of *this, returns immediately.

Otherwise, i.e. if arrival is associated with the phase synchronization point for an earlier phase of *this or any phase of a barrier object other than *this, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters
