arrival_token arrive( std::ptrdiff_t n = 1 );

(since C++20)

Constructs an arrival_token object associated with the phase synchronization point for the current phase. Then, decrements the expected count by n.

This function executes atomically. The call to this function strongly happens-before the start of the phase completion step for the current phase.

The behavior is undefined if n is less than or equal to 0 or greater than the expected count for the current barrier phase.

### Parameters

n

-

the value by which the expected count is decreased

### Return value

The constructed arrival_token object.

### Exceptions

Throws std::system_error with an error code allowed for mutex types on error.

### Notes

This function can cause the completion step for the current phase to start.
