Defined in header <mutex>

class timed_mutex;

(since C++11)

The timed_mutex class is a synchronization primitive that can be used to protect shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads. 

In a manner similar to mutex, timed_mutex offers exclusive, non-recursive ownership semantics. In addition, timed_mutex provides the ability to attempt to claim ownership of a timed_mutex with a timeout via the member functions try_lock_for() and try_lock_until().

The timed_mutex class satisfies all requirements of TimedMutex and StandardLayoutType.

destroys the mutex 
(public member function)

operator=

[deleted]

not copy-assignable 
(public member function)

#### Locking 

lock

locks the mutex, blocks if the mutex is not available 
(public member function)

try_lock

tries to lock the mutex, returns if the mutex is not available 
(public member function)

try_lock_for

tries to lock the mutex, returns if the mutex has been
unavailable for the specified timeout duration 
(public member function)

try_lock_until

tries to lock the mutex, returns if the mutex has been
unavailable until specified time point has been reached 
(public member function)

unlock

unlocks the mutex 
(public member function)

#### Native handle 

native_handle

returns the underlying implementation-defined native handle object 
(public member function)
