friend void swap( stop_token& lhs, stop_token& rhs ) noexcept;

(since C++20)

Overloads the std::swap algorithm for std::stop_token. Exchanges the associated stop-state of lhs with that of rhs. Effectively calls lhs.swap(rhs).

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::stop_token is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

stop_tokens to swap

### Return value

(none)
