future_error( const future_error& other ) noexcept;

(1)
(since C++11)

explicit future_error( std::future_errc ec );

(2)
(since C++17)

1) Copy constructor. Initializes the contents of the new future_error object with those of other. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::future_error then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0.

2) Constructs a new future_error object containing the error code std::make_error_code(ec).

### Parameters

other

-

another future_error object to copy

ec

-

error code

### Notes

There is no standard-compliant way for the user to construct a future_error other than copying from another future_error prior to C++17. C++11 and C++14 depict an exposition-only public constructor taking a std::error_code, and some implementations provide such a constructor.
