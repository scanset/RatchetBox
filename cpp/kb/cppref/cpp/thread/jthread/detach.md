void detach();

(since C++20)

Separates the thread of execution from the jthread object, allowing execution to continue independently. Any allocated resources will be freed once the thread exits.

After calling detach *this no longer owns any thread.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

(none)

### Postconditions

joinable is false.

### Exceptions

std::system_error if joinable() == false or an error occurs.

### Example

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
 
void independentThread() 
{
std::cout << "Starting concurrent thread.\n";
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));
std::cout << "Exiting concurrent thread.\n";
}
 
void threadCaller() 
{
std::cout << "Starting thread caller.\n";
std::jthread t(independentThread);
t.detach();
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
std::cout << "Exiting thread caller.\n";
}
 
int main() 
{
threadCaller();
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(5));
}

Possible output:

Starting thread caller.
Starting concurrent thread.
Exiting thread caller.
Exiting concurrent thread.
