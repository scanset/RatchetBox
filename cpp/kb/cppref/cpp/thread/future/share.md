std::shared_future<T> share() noexcept;

Transfers the shared state of *this, if any, to a std::shared_future object. Multiple std::shared_future objects may reference the same shared state, which is not possible with std::future.

After calling share on a std::future, valid() == false.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

A std::shared_future object containing the shared state previously held by *this, if any, constructed as if by std::shared_future<T>(std::move(*this)).
