~future();

(since C++11)

Releases any shared state. This means:

- If the current object holds the last reference to its shared state, the shared state is destroyed.

- The current object gives up its reference to its shared state.

- These actions will not block for the shared state to become ready, except that they may block if all following conditions are satisfied:
The shared state was created by a call to std::async.

- The shared state is not yet ready.

- The current object was the last reference to the shared state.
