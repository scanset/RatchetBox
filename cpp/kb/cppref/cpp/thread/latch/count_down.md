void count_down( std::ptrdiff_t n = 1 );

(since C++20)

Atomically decrements the internal counter by n without blocking the caller.

If n is greater than the value of the internal counter or is negative, the behavior is undefined.

This operation strongly happens-before all calls that are unblocked on this latch.

### Parameters

n

-

the value by which the internal counter is decreased

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

Throws std::system_error with an error code allowed for mutex types on error.
