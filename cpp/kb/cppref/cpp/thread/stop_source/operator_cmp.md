friend bool operator==( const stop_source& lhs, const stop_source& rhs ) noexcept;

(since C++20)

Compares two stop_source values.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::stop_source is an associated class of the arguments.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

stop_sources to compare

### Return value

true if lhs and rhs have the same stop-state, or both have no stop-state, otherwise false.
