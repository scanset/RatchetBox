template< class Rep, class Period >

bool try_lock_for( const std::chrono::duration<Rep, Period>& timeout_duration );

(since C++11)

Tries to lock the mutex. Blocks until the specified duration timeout_duration has elapsed (timeout) or the lock is acquired (owns the mutex), whichever comes first. On successful lock acquisition returns true, otherwise returns false.

If timeout_duration is less or equal timeout_duration.zero(), the function behaves like try_lock().

This function may block for longer than timeout_duration due to scheduling or resource contention delays.

The standard recommends that a std::steady_clock is used to measure the duration. If an implementation uses a std::system_clock instead, the wait time may also be sensitive to clock adjustments.

As with try_lock(), this function is allowed to fail spuriously and return false even if the mutex was not locked by any other thread at some point during timeout_duration.

Prior unlock() operation on the same mutex synchronizes-with (as defined in std::memory_order) this operation if it returns true.

If try_lock_for is called by a thread that already owns the mutex, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

timeout_duration

-

minimum duration to block for

### Return value

true if the lock was acquired successfully, otherwise false.

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown by timeout_duration (durations provided by the standard library never throw).

### Example

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <sstream>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>
 
using namespace std::chrono_literals;
 
std::mutex cout_mutex; // control access to std::cout
std::timed_mutex mutex;
 
void job(int id)
{
std::ostringstream stream;
 
for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)
{
if (mutex.try_lock_for(100ms))
{
stream << "success ";
std::this_thread::sleep_for(100ms);
mutex.unlock();
}
else
stream << "failed ";
 
std::this_thread::sleep_for(100ms);
}
 
std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock{cout_mutex};
std::cout << '[' << id << "] " << stream.str() << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
std::vector<std::thread> threads;
for (int i{0}; i < 4; ++i)
threads.emplace_back(job, i);
 
for (auto& th : threads)
th.join();
}

Possible output:

[0] failed failed failed 
[3] failed failed success 
[2] failed success failed 
[1] success failed success
