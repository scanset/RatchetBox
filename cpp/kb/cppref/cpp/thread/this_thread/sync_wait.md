auto sync_wait( execution::sender auto sender )

    requires (/*always-sends-some-values*/(sender))

-> std::optional<std::tuple</*value-sent-by*/(sender)>>;

(since C++26)

### Parameters

sender

-

sender upon which the completion of sync_wait is blocked

### Return value

Returns an optional tuple of values that were sent by the provided sender on its completion of work.

### Notes

The sender returned by sync_wait similarly to ensure_started, except that it blocks the current std::thread or thread of main until the work is completed.

### See also

ensure_started

Eagerly starts a sender, returning a sender that will deliver the results to a receiver to which it is connected and started, if any. When the result sender is not connected to a receiver, or if the resulting operation state is not started, the results are ignored. If such a sender is destroyed before the underlying operation completes, the operation continues running detached.
