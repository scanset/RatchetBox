template< class Rep, class Period >

bool try_lock_for( const std::chrono::duration<Rep,Period>& timeout_duration );

(since C++14)

Tries to lock the associated mutex in shared mode. Blocks until specified timeout_duration has elapsed or the lock is acquired, whichever comes first. On successful lock acquisition returns true, otherwise returns false. Effectively calls mutex()->try_lock_shared_for(timeout_duration).

This function may block for longer than timeout_duration due to scheduling or resource contention delays. 

The standard recommends that a steady clock is used to measure the duration. If an implementation uses a system clock instead, the wait time may also be sensitive to clock adjustments.

std::system_error is thrown if there is no associated mutex or if the mutex is already locked.

The behavior is undefined if Mutex does not meet the SharedTimedLockable requirements.

### Parameters

timeout_duration

-

maximum duration to block for

### Return value

true if the ownership of the mutex has been acquired successfully, false otherwise.

### Exceptions

- Any exceptions thrown by mutex()->try_lock_shared_for(timeout_duration).

- If there is no associated mutex, std::system_error with an error code of std::errc::operation_not_permitted.

- If the mutex is already locked, std::system_error with an error code of std::errc::resource_deadlock_would_occur.
