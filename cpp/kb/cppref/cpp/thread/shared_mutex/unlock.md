void unlock();

(since C++17)

Unlocks the mutex.

The mutex must be locked by the current thread of execution, otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

This operation synchronizes-with (as defined in std::memory_order) any subsequent lock operation that obtains ownership of the same mutex.

### Parameters

### Notes

unlock() is usually not called directly: std::unique_lock and std::lock_guard are used to manage exclusive locking.
