bool try_acquire() noexcept;

(since C++20)

Tries to atomically decrement the internal counter by 1 if it is greater than ​0​; no blocking occurs regardless.

### Return value

true if it decremented the internal counter, otherwise false.

### Notes

Implementations are allowed to fail to decrement the counter even if it was greater than ​0​ - i.e., they are allowed to spuriously fail and return false.
