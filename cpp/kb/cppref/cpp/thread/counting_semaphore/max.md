constexpr std::ptrdiff_t max() noexcept;

(since C++20)

Returns the internal counter's maximum possible value, which is greater than or equal to LeastMaxValue.

### Return value

The internal counter's maximum possible value, as a std::ptrdiff_t.

### Notes

For specialization binary_semaphore, LeastMaxValue is equal to 1.

As its name indicates, the LeastMaxValue is the minimum max value, not the actual max value. Thus max() can yield a number larger than LeastMaxValue.
