~counting_semaphore();

(since C++20)

Destroys the counting_semaphore object. 

### Notes

It is only safe to invoke the destructor if all threads have been notified. The programmer must ensure that no threads attempt to wait on *this once the destructor has been started. The destructor does not notify and release any waiting threads.
