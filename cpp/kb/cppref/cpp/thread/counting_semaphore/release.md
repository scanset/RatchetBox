void release( std::ptrdiff_t update = 1 );

(since C++20)

Atomically increments the internal counter by the value of update. Any thread(s) waiting for the counter to be greater than ​0​, such as due to being blocked in acquire, will subsequently be unblocked.

This operation strongly happens before invocations of try_acquire that observe the result of the effects.

### Preconditions

Both update >= 0 and update <= max() - counter are true, where counter is the value of the internal counter.

### Parameters

update

-

the amount to increment the internal counter by

### Exceptions

May throw std::system_error.
