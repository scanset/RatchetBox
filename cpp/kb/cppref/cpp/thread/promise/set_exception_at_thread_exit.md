void set_exception_at_thread_exit( std::exception_ptr p );

(since C++11)

Stores the exception pointer p into the shared state without making the state ready immediately. The state is made ready when the current thread exits, after all variables with thread-local storage duration have been destroyed. 

The operation behaves as though set_value, set_exception, set_value_at_thread_exit, and set_exception_at_thread_exit acquire a single mutex associated with the promise object while updating the promise object.

An exception is thrown if there is no shared state or the shared state already stores a value or exception.

Calls to this function do not introduce data races with calls to get_future (therefore they need not synchronize with each other).

### Parameters

p

-

exception pointer to store. The behavior is undefined if p is nullptr

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

std::future_error on the following conditions:

- *this has no shared state. The error code is set to no_state.

- The shared state already stores a value or exception. The error code is set to promise_already_satisfied.
