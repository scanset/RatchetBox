std::future<R> get_future();

(since C++11)

Returns a future object associated with the same shared state as *this. 

An exception is thrown if *this has no shared state or get_future has already been called. To get multiple "pop" ends of the promise-future communication channel, use std::future::share.

Calls to this function do not introduce data races with calls to set_value, set_exception, set_value_at_thread_exit, or set_exception_at_thread_exit (therefore they need not synchronize with each other).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

A future referring to the shared state of *this.

### Exceptions

std::future_error on the following conditions:

- *this has no shared state. The error code is set to no_state.

- get_future() has already been called on a promise with the same shared state as *this. The error code is set to future_already_retrieved.
