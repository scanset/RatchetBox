Constructs a unique_lock, optionally locking the supplied mutex.

1) Constructs a unique_lock with no associated mutex.

2) Move constructor. Initializes the unique_lock with the contents of other. Leaves other with no associated mutex.

3-8) Constructs a unique_lock with m as the associated mutex. Additionally:

3) Locks the associated mutex by calling m.lock().

4) Does not lock the associated mutex.

5) Tries to lock the associated mutex without blocking by calling m.try_lock(). The behavior is undefined if Mutex does not satisfy Lockable.

6) Assumes the calling thread already holds a non-shared lock (i.e., a lock acquired by lock, try_lock, try_lock_for, or try_lock_until) on m. The behavior is undefined if not so.

7) Tries to lock the associated mutex by calling m.try_lock_for(timeout_duration). Blocks until specified timeout_duration has elapsed or the lock is acquired, whichever comes first. May block for longer than timeout_duration. The behavior is undefined if Mutex does not satisfy TimedLockable.

8) Tries to lock the associated mutex by calling m.try_lock_until(timeout_time). Blocks until specified timeout_time has been reached or the lock is acquired, whichever comes first. May block for longer than until timeout_time has been reached. The behavior is undefined if Mutex does not satisfy TimedLockable.

### Parameters

other

-

another unique_lock to initialize the state with

m

-

mutex to associate with the lock and optionally acquire ownership of

t

-

tag parameter used to select constructors with different locking strategies

timeout_duration

-

maximum duration to block for

timeout_time

-

maximum time point to block until

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
#include <utility>
#include <vector>
 
std::mutex m_a, m_b, m_c;
int a, b, c = 1;
 
void update()
{
{ // Note: std::lock_guard or atomic<int> can be used instead
std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(m_a);
++a;
}
 
{ // Note: see std::lock and std::scoped_lock for details and alternatives
std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk_b(m_b, std::defer_lock);
std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk_c(m_c, std::defer_lock);
std::lock(lk_b, lk_c);
b = std::exchange(c, b + c);
}
}
 
int main()
{
std::vector<std::thread> threads;
for (unsigned i = 0; i < 12; ++i)
threads.emplace_back(update);
 
for (auto& i : threads)
i.join();
 
std::cout << a << "'th and " << a + 1 << "'th Fibonacci numbers: "
<< b << " and " << c << '\n';
}

Output:

12'th and 13'th Fibonacci numbers: 144 and 233
