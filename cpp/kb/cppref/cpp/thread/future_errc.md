Defined in header <future>

enum class future_errc {

    broken_promise             = /* implementation-defined */,

    future_already_retrieved   = /* implementation-defined */,

    promise_already_satisfied  = /* implementation-defined */,

    no_state                   = /* implementation-defined */

};

(since C++11)

The scoped enumeration std::future_errc defines the error codes reported by std::future and related classes in std::future_error exception objects. Only four error codes are required, although the implementation may define additional error codes. Because the appropriate specialization of std::is_error_code_enum is provided, values of type std::future_errc are implicitly convertible to std::error_code. 

All error codes are distinct and non-zero.

### Member constants

Name

Explanation

broken_promise

the asynchronous task abandoned its shared state

future_already_retrieved

the contents of shared state were already accessed through std::future

promise_already_satisfied

attempt to store a value in the shared state twice

no_state

attempt to access std::promise or std::future without an associated shared state

### Non-member functions

make_error_code(std::future_errc)

(C++11)

constructs a future error code 
(function)

make_error_condition(std::future_errc)

(C++11)

constructs a future error_condition 
(function)

### Helper classes

is_error_code_enum<std::future_errc>

(C++11)

extends the type trait std::is_error_code_enum to identify future error codes 
(class template)
