template< class RandomIt >

void pop_heap( RandomIt first, RandomIt last );

(1)
(constexpr since C++20)

template< class RandomIt, class Compare >

void pop_heap( RandomIt first, RandomIt last, Compare comp );

(2)
(constexpr since C++20)

Swaps the value in the position first and the value in the position last - 1 and makes the subrange [first, last - 1) into a heap. This has the effect of removing the first element from the heap [first, last).

1) [first, last) is a heap with respect to operator<(until C++20)std::less{}(since C++20).

2) [first, last) is a heap with respect to comp.

If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined:

- [first, last) is empty.

- [first, last) is not a heap with respect to the corresponding comparator.

- The type of *first is not Swappable.

(until C++11)

- RandomIt is not ValueSwappable.

- The type of *first is not MoveConstructible.

- The type of *first is not MoveAssignable.

(since C++11)

### Parameters

first, last

-

the non-empty heap to modify

comp

-

comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the requirements of Compare) which returns true if the first argument is less than the second.

The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the following:

bool cmp(const Type1& a, const Type2& b);

While the signature does not need to have const&, the function must not modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all values of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value category (thus, Type1& is not allowed, nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a move is equivalent to a copy(since C++11)).

The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type RandomIt can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both of them.

Type requirements

-

RandomIt must meet the requirements of LegacyRandomAccessIterator.

-

Compare must meet the requirements of Compare.

### Complexity

Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as std::distance(first, last):

1) At most \(\scriptsize 2\log(N)\)2log(N) comparisons using operator<(until C++20)std::less{}(since C++20).

2) At most \(\scriptsize 2\log(N)\)2log(N) applications of the comparison function comp.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
#include <type_traits>
#include <vector>
 
void println(std::string_view rem, const auto& v)
{
std::cout << rem;
if constexpr (std::is_scalar_v<std::decay_t<decltype(v)>>)
std::cout << v;
else
for (int e : v)
std::cout << e << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
std::vector<int> v{3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9};
 
std::make_heap(v.begin(), v.end());
println("after make_heap: ", v);
 
std::pop_heap(v.begin(), v.end()); // moves the largest to the end
println("after pop_heap: ", v);
 
int largest = v.back();
println("largest element: ", largest);
 
v.pop_back(); // actually removes the largest element
println("after pop_back: ", v);
}

Output:

after make_heap: 9 5 4 1 1 3
after pop_heap: 5 3 4 1 1 9
largest element: 9
after pop_back: 5 3 4 1 1
