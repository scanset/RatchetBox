void stable_sort( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,

RandomIt first, RandomIt last );

(constexpr since C++26)

template< class ExecutionPolicy, class RandomIt, class Compare >

void stable_sort( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,

RandomIt first, RandomIt last, Compare comp );

(4)
(since C++17)

Sorts the elements in the range [first, last) in non-descending order. The order of equivalent elements is guaranteed to be preserved.

1) Elements are sorted with respect to operator<(until C++20)std::less{}(since C++20).

3) Elements are sorted with respect to comp.

2,4) Same as (1,3), but executed according to policy.

These overloads participate in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.

(until C++20)

std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.

(since C++20)

If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined:

- The type of *first is not Swappable.

(until C++11)

- RandomIt is not ValueSwappable.

- The type of *first is not MoveConstructible.

- The type of *first is not MoveAssignable.

(since C++11)

### Parameters

first, last

-

the range of elements to sort

policy

-

the execution policy to use

comp

-

comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the requirements of Compare) which returns ​true if the first argument is less than (i.e. is ordered before) the second. 

The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the following:

bool cmp(const Type1& a, const Type2& b);

While the signature does not need to have const&, the function must not modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all values of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value category (thus, Type1& is not allowed, nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a move is equivalent to a copy(since C++11)).

The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type RandomIt can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both of them.
​

Type requirements

-

RandomIt must meet the requirements of LegacyRandomAccessIterator.

-

Compare must meet the requirements of Compare.

### Complexity

Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as last - first:

1,2) \(\scriptsize O(N \cdot \log(N))\)O(N·log(N)) comparisons using operator<(until C++20)std::less{}(since C++20) if enough extra memory is available, otherwise \(\scriptsize O(N \cdot \log^{2}(N))\)O(N·log2
(N)) comparisons.

3,4) \(\scriptsize O(N \cdot \log(N))\)O(N·log(N)) applications of the comparator comp if enough extra memory is available, otherwise \(\scriptsize O(N \cdot \log^{2}(N))\)O(N·log2
(N)) applications.

### Exceptions

The overloads with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy report errors as follows:

- If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.

- If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

### Possible implementation

See also the implementations in libstdc++ and libc++.

### Notes

This function attempts to allocate a temporary buffer equal in size to the sequence to be sorted. If the allocation fails, the less efficient algorithm is chosen.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
 
struct Employee
{
int age;
std::string name; // Does not participate in comparisons
};
 
bool operator<(const Employee& lhs, const Employee& rhs)
{
return lhs.age < rhs.age;
}
 
#if __cpp_lib_constexpr_algorithms >= 202306L
consteval auto get_sorted()
{
auto v = std::array{3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9};
std::stable_sort(v.begin(), v.end());
return v;
}
static_assert(std::ranges::is_sorted(get_sorted()));
#endif
 
int main()
{
std::vector<Employee> v{{108, "Zaphod"}, {32, "Arthur"}, {108, "Ford"}};
 
std::stable_sort(v.begin(), v.end());
 
for (const Employee& e : v)
std::cout << e.age << ", " << e.name << '\n';
}

Output:

32, Arthur
108, Zaphod
108, Ford
