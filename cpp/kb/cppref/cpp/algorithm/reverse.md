Defined in header <algorithm>

template< class BidirIt >

void reverse( BidirIt first, BidirIt last );

(1)
(constexpr since C++20)

template< class ExecutionPolicy, class BidirIt >

void reverse( ExecutionPolicy&& policy, BidirIt first, BidirIt last );

(2)
(since C++17)

1) Reverses the order of the elements in the range [first, last).

Behaves as if applying std::iter_swap to every pair of iterators first + i and (last - i) - 1 for each integer i in [​0​, std::distance(first, last) / 2).

2) Same as (1), but executed according to policy.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.

(until C++20)

std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.

(since C++20)

If *first is not Swappable(until C++20)BidirIt is not ValueSwappable(since C++20), the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

first, last

-

the range of elements to reverse

policy

-

the execution policy to use

Type requirements

-

BidirIt must meet the requirements of LegacyBidirectionalIterator.

### Complexity

Exactly std::distance(first, last) / 2 swaps.

### Exceptions

The overload with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy reports errors as follows:

- If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.

- If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

### Possible implementation

See also the implementations in libstdc++, libc++, and MSVC STL.

template<class BidirIt>
constexpr // since C++20
void reverse(BidirIt first, BidirIt last)
{
using iter_cat = typename std::iterator_traits<BidirIt>::iterator_category;
 
// Tag dispatch, e.g. calling reverse_impl(first, last, iter_cat()),
// can be used in C++14 and earlier modes.
if constexpr (std::is_base_of_v<std::random_access_iterator_tag, iter_cat>)
{
if (first == last)
return;
 
for (--last; first < last; (void)++first, --last)
std::iter_swap(first, last);
}
else
while (first != last && first != --last)
std::iter_swap(first++, last);
}

### Notes

Implementations (e.g. MSVC STL) may enable vectorization when the iterator type satisfies LegacyContiguousIterator and swapping its value type calls neither non-trivial special member function nor ADL-found swap.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <vector>
 
void println(auto rem, auto const& v)
{
for (std::cout << rem; auto e : v)
std::cout << e << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
std::vector<int> v {1, 2, 3};
std::reverse(v.begin(), v.end());
println("after reverse, v = ", v);
 
int a[] = {4, 5, 6, 7};
std::reverse(std::begin(a), std::end(a));
println("after reverse, a = ", a);
}

Output:

after reverse, v = 3 2 1
after reverse, a = 7 6 5 4
