C++20 provides constrained versions of most algorithms in the namespace std::ranges. In these algorithms, a range can be specified as either an iterator-sentinel pair or as a single range argument, and projections and pointer-to-member callables are supported. Additionally, the return types of most algorithms have been changed to return all potentially useful information computed during the execution of the algorithm.

### Algorithm function objects

An algorithm function object (AFO), informally known as niebloid, is a customization point object (CPO) that is specified as one or more overloaded function templates. The name of these function templates designates the corresponding algorithm function object.

For an algorithm function object o, let S be the corresponding set of function templates. Then for any sequence of arguments args..., o(args...) is expression-equivalent to s(args...), where the result of name lookup for s is the overload set S.

The constrained algorithms in the namespace std::ranges are defined as algorithm function objects. As a result:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.

- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.

- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.
