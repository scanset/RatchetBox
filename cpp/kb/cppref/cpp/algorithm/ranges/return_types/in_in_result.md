Defined in header <algorithm>

template< class I1, class I2 >

struct in_in_result;

(since C++20)

ranges::in_in_result is a class template that provides a way to store two iterators as a single unit.

This class template has no base classes or declared members other than those shown below. Thus it is suitable for use with structured bindings.

All special member functions of this class template are implicitly declared, which makes specializations be aggregate classes, and propagate triviality, potentially-throwing-ness, and constexpr-ness of corresponding operations on data members.

### Template parameters

I1, I2

-

the types of the iterators that the ranges::in_in_result stores.

### Data members

Member name

Definition

in1

a value (that is supposed to be an iterator) of type I1. 
(public member object)

in2

a value (that is supposed to be an iterator) of type I2. 
(public member object)

All these members are declared with [[no_unique_address]] attribute.

### Member functions

## std::ranges::in_in_result::operator in_in_result<II1, II2>

template<class II1, class II2>

requires std::convertible_to<const I1&, II1> && std::convertible_to<const I2&, II2>

constexpr operator in_in_result<II1, II2>() const &;

(1)

template<class II1, class II2>

requires std::convertible_to<I1, II1> && std::convertible_to<I2, II2>

constexpr operator in_in_result<II1, II2>() &&;

(2)

Converts *this to the result by constructing every data member of the result from the corresponding member of *this.

1) Equivalent to return {in1, in2};.

2) Equivalent to return {std::move(in1), std::move(in2)};.

### Standard library

The following standard library functions use ranges::in_in_result as the return type:

#### Algorithm functions 

ranges::mismatch

(C++20)

finds the first position where two ranges differ
(algorithm function object)

ranges::swap_ranges

(C++20)

swaps two ranges of elements
(algorithm function object)

### Synopsis 

namespace std::ranges
{
template<class I1, class I2>
struct in_in_result
{
[[no_unique_address]] I1 in1;
[[no_unique_address]] I2 in2;
 
template<class II1, class II2>
requires std::convertible_to<const I1&, II1> && std::convertible_to<const I2&, II2>
constexpr operator in_in_result<II1, II2>() const &
{
return {in1, in2};
}
 
template<class II1, class II2>
requires std::convertible_to<I1, II1> && std::convertible_to<I2, II2>
constexpr operator in_in_result<II1, II2>() &&
{
return {std::move(in1), std::move(in2)};
}
};
}

### Notes

Each standard library algorithm that uses this family of return types declares a new alias type, e.g. using merge_result = in_in_out_result<I1, I2, O>;.

The names for such aliases are formed by adding the suffix "_result" to the algorithm's name. So, the return type of std::ranges::merge can be named as std::ranges::merge_result.

Unlike std::pair and std::tuple, this class template has data members of meaningful names.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
constexpr static auto in1 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
constexpr static auto in2 = {1, 2, 4, 5};
 
constexpr auto result {std::ranges::mismatch(in1, in2)};
 
static_assert(2 == std::ranges::distance(in1.begin(), result.in1));
static_assert(2 == std::ranges::distance(in2.begin(), result.in2));
}
