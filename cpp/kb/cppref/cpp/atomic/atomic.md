Each instantiation and full specialization of the std::atomic template defines an atomic type. If one thread writes to an atomic object while another thread reads from it, the behavior is well-defined (see memory model for details on data races).

In addition, accesses to atomic objects may establish inter-thread synchronization and order non-atomic memory accesses as specified by std::memory_order.

std::atomic is neither copyable nor movable.

The compatibility macro _Atomic is provided in <stdatomic.h> such that _Atomic(T) is identical to std::atomic<T> while both are well-formed.

It is unspecified whether any declaration in namespace std is available when <stdatomic.h> is included.

(since C++23)

### Specializations

#### Primary template

The primary std::atomic template may be instantiated with any TriviallyCopyable type T satisfying both CopyConstructible and CopyAssignable. The program is ill-formed if any of following values is false:

- std::is_trivially_copyable<T>::value

- std::is_copy_constructible<T>::value

- std::is_move_constructible<T>::value

- std::is_copy_assignable<T>::value

- std::is_move_assignable<T>::value

- std::is_same<T, typename std::remove_cv<T>::type>::value

struct Counters { int a; int b; }; // user-defined trivially-copyable type
std::atomic<Counters> cnt; // specialization for the user-defined type

std::atomic<bool> uses the primary template. It is guaranteed to be a standard layout struct and has a trivial destructor.

#### Partial specializations

The standard library provides partial specializations of the std::atomic template for the following types with additional properties that the primary template does not have:

2) Partial specializations std::atomic<U*> for all pointer types. These specializations have standard layout, trivial default constructors,(until C++20) and trivial destructors. Besides the operations provided for all atomic types, these specializations additionally support atomic arithmetic operations appropriate to pointer types, such as fetch_add, fetch_sub.

3,4) Partial specializations std::atomic<std::shared_ptr<U>> and std::atomic<std::weak_ptr<U>> are provided for std::shared_ptr and std::weak_ptr.

See std::atomic<std::shared_ptr> and std::atomic<std::weak_ptr> for details.

(since C++20)

#### Specializations for integral types

When instantiated with one of the following integral types, std::atomic provides additional atomic operations appropriate to integral types such as fetch_add, fetch_sub, fetch_and, fetch_or, fetch_xor:

- The character types char, char8_t(since C++20), char16_t, char32_t, and wchar_t;

- The standard signed integer types: signed char, short, int, long, and long long;

- The standard unsigned integer types: unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned long, and unsigned long long;

- Any additional integral types needed by the typedefs in the header <cstdint>.

Additionally, the resulting std::atomic<Integral> specialization has standard layout, a trivial default constructor,(until C++20) and a trivial destructor. Signed integer arithmetic is defined to use two's complement; there are no undefined results.

#### Specializations for floating-point types

When instantiated with one of the cv-unqualified floating-point types (float, double, long double and cv-unqualified extended floating-point types(since C++23)), std::atomic provides additional atomic operations appropriate to floating-point types such as fetch_add and fetch_sub.

Additionally, the resulting std::atomic<Floating> specialization has standard layout and a trivial destructor.

No operations result in undefined behavior even if the result is not representable in the floating-point type. The floating-point environment in effect may be different from the calling thread's floating-point environment.

### Notes

There are non-member function template equivalents for all member functions of std::atomic. Those non-member functions may be additionally overloaded for types that are not specializations of std::atomic, but are able to guarantee atomicity. The only such type in the standard library is std::shared_ptr<U>.

_Atomic is a keyword and used to provide atomic types in C.

Implementations are recommended to ensure that the representation of _Atomic(T) in C is same as that of std::atomic<T> in C++ for every possible type T. The mechanisms used to ensure atomicity and memory ordering should be compatible.

On GCC and Clang, some of the functionality described here requires linking against -latomic.

Run this code

#include <atomic>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>
 
std::atomic_int acnt;
int cnt;
 
void f()
{
for (auto n{10000}; n; --n)
{
++acnt;
++cnt;
// Note: for this example, relaxed memory order is sufficient,
// e.g. acnt.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
}
}
 
int main()
{
{
std::vector<std::jthread> pool;
for (int n = 0; n < 10; ++n)
pool.emplace_back(f);
}
 
std::cout << "The atomic counter is " << acnt << '\n'
<< "The non-atomic counter is " << cnt << '\n';
}

Possible output:

The atomic counter is 100000
The non-atomic counter is 69696
