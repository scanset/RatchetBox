Constructs a new atomic variable.

1) The default constructor is trivial: no initialization takes place other than zero initialization of static and thread-local objects.

std::atomic_init may be used to complete initialization.

(until C++20)

1) Value-initializes the underlying object (i.e. with T()). The initialization is not atomic.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_default_constructible_v<T> is true.

(since C++20)

2) Initializes the underlying object with desired. The initialization is not atomic.

3) Atomic variables are not CopyConstructible.

### Parameters

desired

-

value to initialize with

### Notes

The default-initialized std::atomic<T> does not contain a T object, and its only valid uses are destruction and initialization by std::atomic_init, see LWG issue 2334.
