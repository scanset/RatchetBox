void notify_one() volatile noexcept;

(2)
(since C++20)

Performs atomic notifying operations.

If there is a thread blocked in atomic waiting operation (i.e. wait()) on *this, then unblocks at least one such thread; otherwise does nothing.

### Notes

This form of change-detection is often more efficient than simple polling or pure spinlocks.
