(2)
(since C++11)

Atomically replaces the current value with the result of bitwise AND of the value and arg. The operation is read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the value of order.

It is deprecated if std::atomic<T>::is_always_lock_free is false and overload (2) participates in overload resolution.

(since C++20)

### Parameters

arg

-

the other argument of bitwise AND

order

-

memory order constraints to enforce

### Return value

The value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification order of *this.
