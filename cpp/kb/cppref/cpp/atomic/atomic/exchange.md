T exchange( T desired, std::memory_order order =

                           std::memory_order_seq_cst ) noexcept;

(1)
(since C++11)

T exchange( T desired, std::memory_order order =

                           std::memory_order_seq_cst ) volatile noexcept;

(2)
(since C++11)

Atomically replaces the underlying value with desired (a read-modify-write operation). Memory is affected according to the value of order.

It is deprecated if std::atomic<T>::is_always_lock_free is false and overload (2) participates in overload resolution.

(since C++20)

### Parameters

desired

-

value to assign

order

-

memory order constraints to enforce

### Return value

The value of the atomic variable before the call.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <atomic>
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
#include <syncstream>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
constexpr int thread_count{5};
constexpr int sum{5};
 
std::atomic<int> atom{0};
std::atomic<int> counter{0};
 
auto increment_to_sum = [&](const int id)
{
for (int next = 0; next < sum;)
{
// each thread is writing a value from its own knowledge
const int current = atom.exchange(next);
counter++;
// sync writing to prevent from interrupting by other threads
std::osyncstream(std::cout)
<< "Thread #" << id << " (id=" << std::this_thread::get_id()
<< ") wrote " << next << " replacing the old value "
<< current << ".\n";
next = std::max(current, next) + 1;
}
};
 
std::vector<std::thread> v;
for (std::size_t i = 0; i < thread_count; ++i)
v.emplace_back(increment_to_sum, i);
 
for (auto& tr : v)
tr.join();
 
std::cout << thread_count << " threads take "
<< counter << " times in total to "
<< "increment 0 to " << sum << ".\n";
}

Possible output:
