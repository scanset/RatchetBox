T load( std::memory_order order

T load( std::memory_order order

            = std::memory_order_seq_cst ) const volatile noexcept;

(2)
(since C++11)

Atomically loads and returns the current value of the atomic variable. Memory is affected according to the value of order.

If order is one of std::memory_order_release and std::memory_order_acq_rel, the behavior is undefined.

It is deprecated if std::atomic<T>::is_always_lock_free is false and overload (2) participates in overload resolution.

(since C++20)
