Atomically replaces the current value with the result of std::min of the value and arg. That is, it performs atomic minimum operation. The operation is a read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the value of order.

3,4) If the pointers point to different complete objects (or subobjects thereof), pointer comparison does not establish a strict weak ordering.

It is deprecated if std::atomic<T>::is_always_lock_free is false and overload (2) or (4) participates in overload resolution.

### Parameters

arg

-

the other argument of std::min

order

-

memory order constraints to enforce

### Return value

The value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification order of *this.
