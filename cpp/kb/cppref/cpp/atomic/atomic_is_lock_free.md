1,2) Determines if the atomic object pointed to by obj is implemented lock-free, as if by calling obj->is_lock_free(). In any given program execution, the result of the lock-free query is the same for all atomic objects of the same type.

3,4) Expands to an integer constant expression with value

- ​0​ for the built-in atomic types that are never lock-free,

- 1 for the built-in atomic types that are sometimes lock-free,

- 2 for the built-in atomic types that are always lock-free.

### Parameters

obj

-

pointer to the atomic object to examine

### Return value

true if *obj is a lock-free atomic, false otherwise.

### Notes

All atomic types except for std::atomic_flag may be implemented using mutexes or other locking operations, rather than using the lock-free atomic CPU instructions. Atomic types are also allowed to be sometimes lock-free: for example, if only some subarchitectures support lock-free atomic access for a given type (such as the CMPXCHG16B instruction on x86-64), whether atomics are lock-free may not be known until runtime.

The C++ standard recommends (but does not require) that lock-free atomic operations are also address-free, that is, suitable for communication between processes using shared memory.

### Example

Run this code

#include <atomic>
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
 
struct A { int a[100]; };
struct B { int x, y; };
 
int main()
{
std::atomic<A> a;
std::atomic<B> b;
std::cout << std::boolalpha
<< "std::atomic<A> is lock free? "
<< std::atomic_is_lock_free(&a) << '\n'
<< "std::atomic<B> is lock free? "
<< std::atomic_is_lock_free(&b) << '\n';
}

Possible output:

std::atomic<A> is lock free? false
std::atomic<B> is lock free? true
