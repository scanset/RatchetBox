Defined in header <atomic>

#define ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT /* implementation-defined */

(since C++11)

Defines the initializer which can be used to initialize std::atomic_flag to clear (false) state in the form std::atomic_flag v = ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT;. It is unspecified if it can be used with other initialization contexts.

If the flag has is a complete object with static storage duration, this initialization is static.

This is the only way to initialize std::atomic_flag to a definite value: the value held after any other initialization is unspecified.

(until C++20)

This macro is no longer needed since default constructor of std::atomic_flag initializes it to clear state. It is kept for the compatibility with C.

(since C++20)

### Example

Run this code

#include <atomic>
 
std::atomic_flag static_flag = ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT; // static initialization,
// guaranteed to be available during dynamic initialization of static objects.
 
int main()
{
std::atomic_flag automatic_flag = ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT; // guaranteed to work
// std::atomic_flag another_flag(ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT); // unspecified
}
