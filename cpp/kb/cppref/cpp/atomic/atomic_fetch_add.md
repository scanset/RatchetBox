std::memory_order order ) noexcept;

(4)
(since C++11)

Performs atomic addition. Atomically adds arg to the value pointed to by obj and returns the value obj held previously. The operation is performed as if the following was executed:

1,2) obj->fetch_add(arg)

3,4) obj->fetch_add(arg, order)

If std::atomic<T> has no fetch_add member (this member is only provided for integral, floating-point(since C++20) and pointer types except bool), the program is ill-formed.

### Parameters

obj

-

pointer to the atomic object to modify

arg

-

the value to add to the value stored in the atomic object

order

-

the memory synchronization ordering

### Return value

The value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification order of *obj.

### Example

Single-writer/multiple-reader lock can be made with std::atomic_fetch_add. Note that this simplistic implementation is not lockout-free.

Run this code

#include <atomic>
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>
 
using namespace std::chrono_literals;
 
// meaning of cnt:
// 5: readers and writer are in race. There are no active readers or writers.
// 4...0: there are 1...5 active readers, The writer is blocked.
// -1: writer won the race and readers are blocked.
 
const int N = 5; // four concurrent readers are allowed
std::atomic<int> cnt(N);
 
std::vector<int> data;
 
void reader(int id)
{
for (;;)
{
// lock
while (std::atomic_fetch_sub(&cnt, 1) <= 0)
std::atomic_fetch_add(&cnt, 1);
 
// read
if (!data.empty())
std::cout << ("reader " + std::to_string(id) +
" sees " + std::to_string(*data.rbegin()) + '\n');
if (data.size() == 25)
break;
 
// unlock
std::atomic_fetch_add(&cnt, 1);
 
// pause
std::this_thread::sleep_for(1ms);
}
}
 
void writer()
{
for (int n = 0; n < 25; ++n)
{
// lock
while (std::atomic_fetch_sub(&cnt, N + 1) != N)
std::atomic_fetch_add(&cnt, N + 1);
 
// write
data.push_back(n);
std::cout << "writer pushed back " << n << '\n';
 
// unlock
std::atomic_fetch_add(&cnt, N + 1);
 
// pause
std::this_thread::sleep_for(1ms);
}
}
 
int main()
{
std::vector<std::thread> v;
for (int n = 0; n < N; ++n)
v.emplace_back(reader, n);
v.emplace_back(writer);
 
for (auto& t : v)
t.join();
}

Output:

writer pushed back 0
reader 2 sees 0
reader 3 sees 0
reader 1 sees 0
<...>
reader 2 sees 24
reader 4 sees 24
reader 1 sees 24
