value_type operator&=( value_type arg ) const noexcept;

(1)
(since C++20)

value_type operator|=( value_type arg ) const noexcept;

(2)
(since C++20)

value_type operator^=( value_type arg ) const noexcept;

(3)
(since C++20)

Atomically replaces the current value of the referenced object with the result of computation involving the previous value and arg. These operations are read-modify-write operations.

- operator&= performs atomic bitwise AND. Equivalent to return fetch_and(arg) & arg;.

- operator!= performs atomic bitwise OR. Equivalent to return fetch_or(arg) | arg;.

- operator^= performs atomic bitwise XOR. Equivalent to return fetch_xor(arg) ^ arg;.

These overloads participate in overload resolution only if std::is_const_v<T> is false.

### Parameters

arg

-

the argument for the arithmetic operation

### Return value

The resulting value (that is, the result of applying the corresponding binary operator to the value immediately preceding the effects of the corresponding member function).

### Notes

Unlike most compound assignment operators, the compound assignment operators for atomic_ref do not return a reference to their left-hand arguments. They return a copy of the stored value instead.
