value_type operator=( value_type desired ) const noexcept;

(1)
(constexpr since C++26)

atomic_ref& operator=( const atomic_ref& ) = delete;

(2)

1) Equivalent to store(desired); return desired;. This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_const_v<T> is false.

2) atomic_ref is not CopyAssignable.

### Parameters

desired

-

value to assign

### Return value

As described above.

### Notes

Unlike most assignment operators, the assignment operator for atomic_ref does not return a reference to its left-hand argument. It returns a copy of the stored value instead.
