void notify_all() const noexcept;

(constexpr since C++26)

Performs atomic notifying operations.

Unblocks all threads blocked in atomic waiting operations (i.e. wait()) on *ptr, if there are any; otherwise does nothing.
This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_const_v<T> is false.

### Notes

This form of change-detection is often more efficient than simple polling or pure spinlocks.
