Provided only when T is an arithmetic type other than cv bool or a pointer-to-object type

value_type operator+=( difference_type arg ) const noexcept;

(1)
(constexpr since C++26)

value_type operator-=( difference_type arg ) const noexcept;

(2)
(constexpr since C++26)

Atomically replaces the current value referenced by *ptr with the result of computation involving the previous value and arg. These operations are read-modify-write operations.

1) operator+= performs atomic addition. Equivalent to return fetch_add(arg) + arg;.

2) operator-= performs atomic subtraction. Equivalent to return fetch_sub(arg) - arg;.

- For signed integral types, arithmetic is defined to use two’s complement representation. There are no undefined results.

- For floating-point types, the floating-point environment in effect may be different from the calling thread's floating-point environment. The operation need not be conform to the corresponding std::numeric_limits traits but is encouraged to do so. If the result is not a representable value for its type, the result is unspecified but the operation otherwise has no undefined behavior.

- For pointer types, the result may be an undefined address, but the operation otherwise has no undefined behavior.
If std::remove_pointer_t<T> is not a complete object type, the program is ill-formed.

These overloads participate in overload resolution only if std::is_const_v<T> is false.

### Parameters

arg

-

the argument for the arithmetic operation

### Return value

The resulting value (that is, the result of applying the corresponding binary operator to the value referenced by *ptr immediately preceding the effects of the corresponding member function).

### Notes

Unlike most compound assignment operators, the compound assignment operators for atomic_ref return a copy of the stored value instead of a reference to arg.
