value_type exchange( value_type desired,

                     std::memory_order order =

std::memory_order_seq_cst ) const noexcept;

(constexpr since C++26)

Atomically replaces the value of the referenced object with desired. The operation is a read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the value of order.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_const_v<T> is false.

### Parameters

desired

-

value to assign

order

-

memory order constraints to enforce

### Return value

The value of the referenced object before the call.
