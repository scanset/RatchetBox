bool is_lock_free() const noexcept;

(since C++20)

Checks whether the atomic operations on this object are lock-free.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if the atomic operations on this object are lock-free, false otherwise.

### Notes

All atomic types except for std::atomic_flag may be implemented using mutexes or other locking operations, rather than using the lock-free atomic CPU instructions. Atomic types are also allowed to be sometimes lock-free, e.g. if only aligned memory accesses are naturally atomic on a given architecture, misaligned objects of the same type have to use locks.

The C++ standard recommends (but does not require) that lock-free atomic operations are also address-free, that is, suitable for communication between processes using shared memory.
