(4)
(since C++26)

Atomically replaces the value pointed by obj with the result of std::min between the old value of obj and arg. Returns the value obj held previously. The operation is performed as if the following was executed:

1,2) obj->fetch_min(arg)

3,4) obj->fetch_min(arg, order)

If std::atomic<T> has no fetch_min member (this member is only provided for integral and pointer types except bool), the program is ill-formed.

### Parameters

obj

-

pointer to the atomic object to modify

arg

-

the value to std::min with the value stored in the atomic object

order

-

the memory synchronization ordering

### Return value

The value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification order of *obj.
