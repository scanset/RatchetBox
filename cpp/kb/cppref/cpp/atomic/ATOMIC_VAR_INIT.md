Defined in header <atomic>

#define ATOMIC_VAR_INIT(value) /* implementation-defined */

(since C++11) 
(deprecated in C++20)

Expands to an expression which can be used to initialize an std::atomic object that can be initialized from value. If the atomic object has static storage duration, this initialization is constant initialization.

### Notes

Accessing the variable during initialization from another thread, even through an atomic operation, is a data race (it may happen if the address is immediately passed to another thread with a std::memory_order_relaxed operation)

This macro is primarily provided for compatibility with C; it behaves the same as the constructor of std::atomic.

### Example

Run this code

#include <atomic>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::atomic<int> a = ATOMIC_VAR_INIT(1);
// std::atomic<int> a(1); // C++-only alternative
std::cout << "Initialized std::atomic<int> as: " << a << '\n';
}

Output:

Initialized std::atomic<int> as: 1
