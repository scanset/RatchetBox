1,2) Atomically replaces the value pointed to by obj with the value of desired as if by obj->store(desired).

3,4) Atomically replaces the value pointed to by obj with the value of desired as if by obj->store(desired, order).

If order is one of std::memory_order_consume, std::memory_order_acquire and std::memory_order_acq_rel, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

obj

-

pointer to the atomic object to modify

desired

-

the value to store in the atomic object

order

-

the memory synchronization ordering

### Return value

(none)

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

P0558R1

C++11

exact type match was required because
T was deduced from multiple arguments

T is only deduced
from obj
