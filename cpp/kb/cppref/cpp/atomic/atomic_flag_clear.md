void atomic_flag_clear( volatile std::atomic_flag* obj ) noexcept;

(1)
(since C++11)

void atomic_flag_clear( std::atomic_flag* obj ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++11)

void atomic_flag_clear_explicit( volatile std::atomic_flag* obj, 

                                 std::memory_order order ) noexcept;

(3)
(since C++11)

void atomic_flag_clear_explicit( std::atomic_flag* obj, 

                                 std::memory_order order ) noexcept;

(4)
(since C++11)

Atomically changes the state of the std::atomic_flag pointed to by obj to clear (false).

1,2) The memory synchronization ordering is std::memory_order_seq_cst.

3,4) The memory synchronization ordering is order.

If order is one of std::memory_order_consume, std::memory_order_acquire and std::memory_order_acq_rel, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

obj

-

pointer to std::atomic_flag to access

order

-

the memory synchronization ordering

### Notes

std::atomic_flag_clear and std::atomic_flag_clear_explicit can be implemented as obj->clear() and obj->clear(order) respectively.

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
