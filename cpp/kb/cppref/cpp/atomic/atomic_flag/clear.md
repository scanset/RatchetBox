void clear( std::memory_order order =

                std::memory_order_seq_cst ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++11)

Atomically changes the state of a std::atomic_flag to clear (false).

If order is one of std::memory_order_consume, std::memory_order_acquire and std::memory_order_acq_rel, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

order

-

the memory synchronization ordering

### Defect reports
