void atomic_init

    ( volatile std::atomic<T>* obj,

typename std::atomic<T>::value_type desired ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++11) 
(deprecated in C++20)

Initializes the default-constructed atomic object obj with the value desired. The function is not atomic: concurrent access from another thread, even through an atomic operation, is a data race. 

If obj was not default-constructed, or this function is called twice on the same obj, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

obj

-

pointer to an atomic object to initialize

desired

-

the value to initialize atomic object with

### Return value

(none)

### Notes

This function is provided for compatibility with C. If the compatibility is not required, std::atomic may be initialized through their non-default constructors.

exact type match was required because
T was deduced from multiple arguments

from obj
