This header is part of the ranges library.

### Core language concepts 

Defined in namespace std::experimental::ranges 

Same

specifies that a type is the same as another type 
(concept)

DerivedFrom

specifies that a type is derived from another type 
(concept)

ConvertibleTo

specifies that a type is implicitly convertible to another type 
(concept)

CommonReference

specifies that two types share a common reference type 
(concept)

Common

specifies that two types share a common type 
(concept)

Integral

specifies that a type is an integral type 
(concept)

SignedIntegral

specifies that a type is an integral type that is signed 
(concept)

UnsignedIntegral

specifies that a type is an integral type that is not signed 
(concept)

Assignable

specifies that a type is assignable from another type 
(concept)

SwappableSwappableWith

specifies that a type can be swapped or that two types can be swapped with each other 
(concept)

### Comparison concepts 

Defined in namespace std::experimental::ranges 

Boolean

specifies that a type can be used in Boolean contexts 
(concept)

WeaklyEqualityComparableWith

specifies that two types can be compared for equality using operators == and != 
(concept)

EqualityComparableEqualityComparableWith

specifies that operator == is an equivalence relation 
(concept)

StrictTotallyOrderedStrictTotallyOrderedWith

specifies that the comparison operators on the type yield a total order 
(concept)

### Object concepts 

Defined in namespace std::experimental::ranges 

Destructible

specifies that an object of the type can be destroyed 
(concept)

Constructible

specifies that a variable of the type can be constructed from or bound to a set of argument types 
(concept)

DefaultConstructible

specifies that an object of a type can be default constructed 
(concept)

MoveConstructible

specifies that an object of a type can be move constructed 
(concept)

CopyConstructible

specifies that an object of a type can be copy constructed and move constructed 
(concept)

Movable

specifies that an object of a type can be moved and swapped 
(concept)

Copyable

specifies that an object of a type can be copied, moved, and swapped 
(concept)

Semiregular

specifies that an object of a type can be copied, moved, swapped, and default constructed 
(concept)

Regular

specifies that a type is regular, that is, it is both Semiregular and EqualityComparable 
(concept)

### Callable concepts 

Defined in namespace std::experimental::ranges 

InvocableRegularInvocable

specifies that a callable type can be invoked with a given set of argument types 
(concept)

Predicate

specifies that a callable type is a Boolean predicate 
(concept)

Relation

specifies that a callable type is a binary relation 
(concept)

StrictWeakOrder

specifies that a Relation imposes a strict weak ordering 
(concept)
