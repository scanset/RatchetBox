This header was originally in the C standard library as <uchar.h>.

This header is part of the null-terminated multibyte strings library.

### Macros

__STDC_UTF_16__

(C++11)

indicates that UTF-16 encoding is used by mbrtoc16 and c16rtomb 
(macro constant)

__STDC_UTF_32__

(C++11)

indicates that UTF-32 encoding is used by mbrtoc32 and c32rtomb 
(macro constant)
