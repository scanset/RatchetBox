# NEW spec (from spec/<to>), and its CURRENT file contents (so the model EDITS rather than reinvents -
# and so it never re-declares types that live in other, unchanged files). A change layer is a
# cross-cutting edit: all changed units are regenerated TOGETHER and staged atomically (stage_files),
# which is why this context lists them as one set, not one-at-a-time. Args: proj, layers ("<from> <to>").
