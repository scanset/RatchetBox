Package filepath implements utility routines for manipulating filename paths in

Import path: path/filepath   Toolchain: go1.26.4

package filepath // import "path/filepath"

Package filepath implements utility routines for manipulating filename paths in
a way compatible with the target operating system-defined file paths.

The filepath package uses either forward slashes or backslashes, depending on
the operating system. To process paths such as URLs that always use forward
slashes regardless of the operating system, see the path package.

CONSTANTS

VARIABLES

var ErrBadPattern = errors.New("syntax error in pattern")
    ErrBadPattern indicates a pattern was malformed.

var SkipAll error = fs.SkipAll
    SkipAll is used as a return value from WalkFunc to indicate that all
    remaining files and directories are to be skipped. It is not returned as an
    error by any function.

var SkipDir error = fs.SkipDir
    SkipDir is used as a return value from WalkFunc to indicate that the
    directory named in the call is to be skipped. It is not returned as an error
    by any function.


FUNCTIONS

func Abs(path string) (string, error)
    Abs returns an absolute representation of path. If the path is not absolute
    it will be joined with the current working directory to turn it into an
    absolute path. The absolute path name for a given file is not guaranteed to
    be unique. Abs calls Clean on the result.

func Base(path string) string
    Base returns the last element of path. Trailing path separators are removed
    before extracting the last element. If the path is empty, Base returns ".".
    If the path consists entirely of separators, Base returns a single
    separator.

func Clean(path string) string
    Clean returns the shortest path name equivalent to path by purely lexical
    processing. It applies the following rules iteratively until no further
    processing can be done:

     1. Replace multiple Separator elements with a single one.
     2. Eliminate each . path name element (the current directory).
     3. Eliminate each inner .. path name element (the parent directory) along
        with the non-.. element that precedes it.
     4. Eliminate .. elements that begin a rooted path: that is, replace "/.."
        by "/" at the beginning of a path, assuming Separator is '/'.

    The returned path ends in a slash only if it represents a root directory,
    such as "/" on Unix or `C:\` on Windows.

    Finally, any occurrences of slash are replaced by Separator.

    If the result of this process is an empty string, Clean returns the string
    ".".

    On Windows, Clean does not modify the volume name other than to replace
    occurrences of "/" with `\`. For example, Clean("//host/share/../x") returns
    `\\host\share\x`.

    See also Rob Pike, “Lexical File Names in Plan 9 or Getting Dot-Dot Right,”
    https://9p.io/sys/doc/lexnames.html

func Dir(path string) string
    Dir returns all but the last element of path, typically the path's
    directory. After dropping the final element, Dir calls Clean on the path and
    trailing slashes are removed. If the path is empty, Dir returns ".". If the
    path consists entirely of separators, Dir returns a single separator. The
    returned path does not end in a separator unless it is the root directory.

func EvalSymlinks(path string) (string, error)
    EvalSymlinks returns the path name after the evaluation of any symbolic
    links. If path is relative the result will be relative to the current
    directory, unless one of the components is an absolute symbolic link.
    EvalSymlinks calls Clean on the result.

func Ext(path string) string
    Ext returns the file name extension used by path. The extension is the
    suffix beginning at the final dot in the final element of path; it is empty
    if there is no dot.

func FromSlash(path string) string
    FromSlash returns the result of replacing each slash ('/') character in
    path with a separator character. Multiple slashes are replaced by multiple
    separators.

    See also the Localize function, which converts a slash-separated path as
    used by the io/fs package to an operating system path.

func Glob(pattern string) (matches []string, err error)
    Glob returns the names of all files matching pattern or nil if there
    is no matching file. The syntax of patterns is the same as in Match.
    The pattern may describe hierarchical names such as /usr/*/bin/ed (assuming
    the Separator is '/').

    Glob ignores file system errors such as I/O errors reading directories. The
    only possible returned error is ErrBadPattern, when pattern is malformed.

func HasPrefix(p, prefix string) bool
    HasPrefix exists for historical compatibility and should not be used.

    Deprecated: HasPrefix does not respect path boundaries and does not ignore
    case when required.

func IsAbs(path string) bool
    IsAbs reports whether the path is absolute.

func IsLocal(path string) bool
    IsLocal reports whether path, using lexical analysis only, has all of these
    properties:

      - is within the subtree rooted at the directory in which path is evaluated
      - is not an absolute path
      - is not empty
      - on Windows, is not a reserved name such as "NUL"

    If IsLocal(path) returns true, then Join(base, path) will always produce a
    path contained within base and Clean(path) will always produce an unrooted
    path with no ".." path elements.

    IsLocal is a purely lexical operation. In particular, it does not account
    for the effect of any symbolic links that may exist in the filesystem.

func Join(elem ...string) string
    Join joins any number of path elements into a single path, separating them
    with an OS specific Separator. Empty elements are ignored. The result is
    Cleaned. However, if the argument list is empty or all its elements are
    empty, Join returns an empty string. On Windows, the result will only be a
    UNC path if the first non-empty element is a UNC path.

func Localize(path string) (string, error)
    Localize converts a slash-separated path into an operating system path.
    The input path must be a valid path as reported by io/fs.ValidPath.

    Localize returns an error if the path cannot be represented by the operating
    system. For example, the path a\b is rejected on Windows, on which \ is a
    separator character and cannot be part of a filename.

    The path returned by Localize will always be local, as reported by IsLocal.

func Match(pattern, name string) (matched bool, err error)
    Match reports whether name matches the shell file name pattern. The pattern
    syntax is:

        pattern:
        	{ term }
        term:
        	'*'         matches any sequence of non-Separator characters
        	'?'         matches any single non-Separator character
        	'[' [ '^' ] { character-range } ']'
        	            character class (must be non-empty)
        	c           matches character c (c != '*', '?', '\\', '[')
        	'\\' c      matches character c (except on Windows)

        character-range:
        	c           matches character c (c != '\\', '-', ']')
        	'\\' c      matches character c (except on Windows)
        	lo '-' hi   matches character c for lo <= c <= hi

    Path segments in the pattern must be separated by Separator.

    Match requires pattern to match all of name, not just a substring. The only
    possible returned error is ErrBadPattern, when pattern is malformed.

    On Windows, escaping is disabled. Instead, '\\' is treated as path
    separator.

func Rel(basePath, targPath string) (string, error)
    Rel returns a relative path that is lexically equivalent to targPath when
    joined to basePath with an intervening separator. That is, Join(basePath,
    Rel(basePath, targPath)) is equivalent to targPath itself.

    The returned path will always be relative to basePath, even if basePath and
    targPath share no elements. Rel calls Clean on the result.

    An error is returned if targPath can't be made relative to basePath or if
    knowing the current working directory would be necessary to compute it.

func Split(path string) (dir, file string)
    Split splits path immediately following the final Separator, separating it
    into a directory and file name component. If there is no Separator in path,
    Split returns an empty dir and file set to path. The returned values have
    the property that path = dir+file.

func SplitList(path string) []string
    SplitList splits a list of paths joined by the OS-specific ListSeparator,
    usually found in PATH or GOPATH environment variables. Unlike strings.Split,
    SplitList returns an empty slice when passed an empty string.

func ToSlash(path string) string
    ToSlash returns the result of replacing each separator character in path
    with a slash ('/') character. Multiple separators are replaced by multiple
    slashes.

func VolumeName(path string) string
    VolumeName returns leading volume name. Given "C:\foo\bar" it returns "C:"
    on Windows. Given "\\host\share\foo" it returns "\\host\share". On other
    platforms it returns "".

func Walk(root string, fn WalkFunc) error
    Walk walks the file tree rooted at root, calling fn for each file or
    directory in the tree, including root.

    All errors that arise visiting files and directories are filtered by fn:
    see the WalkFunc documentation for details.

    The files are walked in lexical order, which makes the output deterministic
    but requires Walk to read an entire directory into memory before proceeding
    to walk that directory.

    Walk does not follow symbolic links.

    Walk is less efficient than WalkDir, introduced in Go 1.16, which avoids
    calling os.Lstat on every visited file or directory.

func WalkDir(root string, fn fs.WalkDirFunc) error
    WalkDir walks the file tree rooted at root, calling fn for each file or
    directory in the tree, including root.

    All errors that arise visiting files and directories are filtered by fn:
    see the fs.WalkDirFunc documentation for details.

    The files are walked in lexical order, which makes the output deterministic
    but requires WalkDir to read an entire directory into memory before
    proceeding to walk that directory.

    WalkDir does not follow symbolic links.

    WalkDir calls fn with paths that use the separator character appropriate for
    the operating system. This is unlike io/fs.WalkDir, which always uses slash
    separated paths.


TYPES

type WalkFunc func(path string, info fs.FileInfo, err error) error
    WalkFunc is the type of the function called by Walk to visit each file or
    directory.

    The path argument contains the argument to Walk as a prefix. That is,
    if Walk is called with root argument "dir" and finds a file named "a" in
    that directory, the walk function will be called with argument "dir/a".

    The directory and file are joined with Join, which may clean the directory
    name: if Walk is called with the root argument "x/../dir" and finds a file
    named "a" in that directory, the walk function will be called with argument
    "dir/a", not "x/../dir/a".

    The info argument is the fs.FileInfo for the named path.

    The error result returned by the function controls how Walk continues.
    If the function returns the special value SkipDir, Walk skips the current
    directory (path if info.IsDir() is true, otherwise path's parent directory).
    If the function returns the special value SkipAll, Walk skips all remaining
    files and directories. Otherwise, if the function returns a non-nil error,
    Walk stops entirely and returns that error.

    The err argument reports an error related to path, signaling that Walk will
    not walk into that directory. The function can decide how to handle that
    error; as described earlier, returning the error will cause Walk to stop
    walking the entire tree.

    Walk calls the function with a non-nil err argument in two cases.

    First, if an os.Lstat on the root directory or any directory or file in
    the tree fails, Walk calls the function with path set to that directory or
    file's path, info set to nil, and err set to the error from os.Lstat.

    Second, if a directory's Readdirnames method fails, Walk calls the
    function with path set to the directory's path, info, set to an fs.FileInfo
    describing the directory, and err set to the error from Readdirnames.
