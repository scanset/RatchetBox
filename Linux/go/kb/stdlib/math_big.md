Package big implements arbitrary-precision arithmetic (big numbers). The

Import path: math/big   Toolchain: go1.26.4

package big // import "math/big"

Package big implements arbitrary-precision arithmetic (big numbers). The
following numeric types are supported:

    Int    signed integers
    Rat    rational numbers
    Float  floating-point numbers

The zero value for an Int, Rat, or Float correspond to 0. Thus, new values can
be declared in the usual ways and denote 0 without further initialization:

    var x Int        // &x is an *Int of value 0
    var r = &Rat{}   // r is a *Rat of value 0
    y := new(Float)  // y is a *Float of value 0

Alternatively, new values can be allocated and initialized with factory
functions of the form:

    func NewT(v V) *T

For instance, NewInt(x) returns an *Int set to the value of the int64 argument
x, NewRat(a, b) returns a *Rat set to the fraction a/b where a and b are int64
values, and NewFloat(f) returns a *Float initialized to the float64 argument f.
More flexibility is provided with explicit setters, for instance:

    var z1 Int
    z1.SetUint64(123)                 // z1 := 123
    z2 := new(Rat).SetFloat64(1.25)   // z2 := 5/4
    z3 := new(Float).SetInt(z1)       // z3 := 123.0

Setters, numeric operations and predicates are represented as methods of the
form:

    func (z *T) SetV(v V) *T          // z = v
    func (z *T) Unary(x *T) *T        // z = unary x
    func (z *T) Binary(x, y *T) *T    // z = x binary y
    func (x *T) Pred() P              // p = pred(x)

with T one of Int, Rat, or Float. For unary and binary operations, the result
is the receiver (usually named z in that case; see below); if it is one of the
operands x or y it may be safely overwritten (and its memory reused).

Arithmetic expressions are typically written as a sequence of individual method
calls, with each call corresponding to an operation. The receiver denotes the
result and the method arguments are the operation's operands. For instance,
given three *Int values a, b and c, the invocation

    c.Add(a, b)

computes the sum a + b and stores the result in c, overwriting whatever value
was held in c before. Unless specified otherwise, operations permit aliasing of
parameters, so it is perfectly ok to write

    sum.Add(sum, x)

to accumulate values x in a sum.

(By always passing in a result value via the receiver, memory use can be much
better controlled. Instead of having to allocate new memory for each result,
an operation can reuse the space allocated for the result value, and overwrite
that value with the new result in the process.)

Notational convention: Incoming method parameters (including the receiver)
are named consistently in the API to clarify their use. Incoming operands are
usually named x, y, a, b, and so on, but never z. A parameter specifying the
result is named z (typically the receiver).

For instance, the arguments for (*Int).Add are named x and y, and because the
receiver specifies the result destination, it is called z:

    func (z *Int) Add(x, y *Int) *Int

Methods of this form typically return the incoming receiver as well, to enable
simple call chaining.

Methods which don't require a result value to be passed in (for instance,
Int.Sign), simply return the result. In this case, the receiver is typically the
first operand, named x:

    func (x *Int) Sign() int

Various methods support conversions between strings and corresponding numeric
values, and vice versa: *Int, *Rat, and *Float values implement the Stringer
interface for a (default) string representation of the value, but also provide
SetString methods to initialize a value from a string in a variety of supported
formats (see the respective SetString documentation).

Finally, *Int, *Rat, and *Float satisfy fmt.Scanner for scanning and (except for
*Rat) the Formatter interface for formatted printing.

CONSTANTS

const (
	MaxExp  = math.MaxInt32  // largest supported exponent
	MinExp  = math.MinInt32  // smallest supported exponent
	MaxPrec = math.MaxUint32 // largest (theoretically) supported precision; likely memory-limited
)
    Exponent and precision limits.

const MaxBase = 10 + ('z' - 'a' + 1) + ('Z' - 'A' + 1)
    MaxBase is the largest number base accepted for string conversions.


FUNCTIONS

func Jacobi(x, y *Int) int
    Jacobi returns the Jacobi symbol (x/y), either +1, -1, or 0. The y argument
    must be an odd integer.

func ParseFloat(s string, base int, prec uint, mode RoundingMode) (f *Float, b int, err error)
    ParseFloat is like f.Parse(s, base) with f set to the given precision and
    rounding mode.


TYPES

type Accuracy int8
    Accuracy describes the rounding error produced by the most recent operation
    that generated a Float value, relative to the exact value.

const (
	Below Accuracy = -1
	Exact Accuracy = 0
	Above Accuracy = +1
)
    Constants describing the Accuracy of a Float.

func (i Accuracy) String() string

type ErrNaN struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    An ErrNaN panic is raised by a Float operation that would lead to a NaN
    under IEEE 754 rules. An ErrNaN implements the error interface.

func (err ErrNaN) Error() string

type Float struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A nonzero finite Float represents a multi-precision floating point number

        sign × mantissa × 2**exponent

    with 0.5 <= mantissa < 1.0, and MinExp <= exponent <= MaxExp. A Float may
    also be zero (+0, -0) or infinite (+Inf, -Inf). All Floats are ordered,
    and the ordering of two Floats x and y is defined by x.Cmp(y).

    Each Float value also has a precision, rounding mode, and accuracy.
    The precision is the maximum number of mantissa bits available to represent
    the value. The rounding mode specifies how a result should be rounded to
    fit into the mantissa bits, and accuracy describes the rounding error with
    respect to the exact result.

    Unless specified otherwise, all operations (including setters) that
    specify a *Float variable for the result (usually via the receiver with
    the exception of Float.MantExp), round the numeric result according to the
    precision and rounding mode of the result variable.

    If the provided result precision is 0 (see below), it is set to the
    precision of the argument with the largest precision value before any
    rounding takes place, and the rounding mode remains unchanged. Thus,
    uninitialized Floats provided as result arguments will have their precision
    set to a reasonable value determined by the operands, and their mode is the
    zero value for RoundingMode (ToNearestEven).

    By setting the desired precision to 24 or 53 and using matching rounding
    mode (typically ToNearestEven), Float operations produce the same results
    as the corresponding float32 or float64 IEEE 754 arithmetic for operands
    that correspond to normal (i.e., not denormal) float32 or float64 numbers.
    Exponent underflow and overflow lead to a 0 or an Infinity for different
    values than IEEE 754 because Float exponents have a much larger range.

    The zero (uninitialized) value for a Float is ready to use and represents
    the number +0.0 exactly, with precision 0 and rounding mode ToNearestEven.

    Operations always take pointer arguments (*Float) rather than Float values,
    and each unique Float value requires its own unique *Float pointer.
    To "copy" a Float value, an existing (or newly allocated) Float must be set
    to a new value using the Float.Set method; shallow copies of Floats are not
    supported and may lead to errors.

func NewFloat(x float64) *Float
    NewFloat allocates and returns a new Float set to x, with precision 53 and
    rounding mode ToNearestEven. NewFloat panics with ErrNaN if x is a NaN.

func (z *Float) Abs(x *Float) *Float
    Abs sets z to the (possibly rounded) value |x| (the absolute value of x) and
    returns z.

func (x *Float) Acc() Accuracy
    Acc returns the accuracy of x produced by the most recent operation,
    unless explicitly documented otherwise by that operation.

func (z *Float) Add(x, y *Float) *Float
    Add sets z to the rounded sum x+y and returns z. If z's precision is 0,
    it is changed to the larger of x's or y's precision before the operation.
    Rounding is performed according to z's precision and rounding mode; and
    z's accuracy reports the result error relative to the exact (not rounded)
    result. Add panics with ErrNaN if x and y are infinities with opposite
    signs. The value of z is undefined in that case.

func (x *Float) Append(buf []byte, fmt byte, prec int) []byte
    Append appends to buf the string form of the floating-point number x,
    as generated by x.Text, and returns the extended buffer.

func (x *Float) AppendText(b []byte) ([]byte, error)
    AppendText implements the encoding.TextAppender interface. Only the Float
    value is marshaled (in full precision), other attributes such as precision
    or accuracy are ignored.

func (x *Float) Cmp(y *Float) int
    Cmp compares x and y and returns:
      - -1 if x < y;
      - 0 if x == y (incl. -0 == 0, -Inf == -Inf, and +Inf == +Inf);
      - +1 if x > y.

func (z *Float) Copy(x *Float) *Float
    Copy sets z to x, with the same precision, rounding mode, and accuracy as x.
    Copy returns z. If x and z are identical, Copy is a no-op.

func (x *Float) Float32() (float32, Accuracy)
    Float32 returns the float32 value nearest to x. If x is too small to be
    represented by a float32 (|x| < math.SmallestNonzeroFloat32), the result
    is (0, Below) or (-0, Above), respectively, depending on the sign of x.
    If x is too large to be represented by a float32 (|x| > math.MaxFloat32),
    the result is (+Inf, Above) or (-Inf, Below), depending on the sign of x.

func (x *Float) Float64() (float64, Accuracy)
    Float64 returns the float64 value nearest to x. If x is too small to be
    represented by a float64 (|x| < math.SmallestNonzeroFloat64), the result
    is (0, Below) or (-0, Above), respectively, depending on the sign of x.
    If x is too large to be represented by a float64 (|x| > math.MaxFloat64),
    the result is (+Inf, Above) or (-Inf, Below), depending on the sign of x.

func (x *Float) Format(s fmt.State, format rune)
    Format implements fmt.Formatter. It accepts all the regular formats for
    floating-point numbers ('b', 'e', 'E', 'f', 'F', 'g', 'G', 'x') as well as
    'p' and 'v'. See (*Float).Text for the interpretation of 'p'. The 'v' format
    is handled like 'g'. Format also supports specification of the minimum
    precision in digits, the output field width, as well as the format flags '+'
    and ' ' for sign control, '0' for space or zero padding, and '-' for left or
    right justification. See the fmt package for details.

func (z *Float) GobDecode(buf []byte) error
    GobDecode implements the encoding/gob.GobDecoder interface. The result is
    rounded per the precision and rounding mode of z unless z's precision is 0,
    in which case z is set exactly to the decoded value.

func (x *Float) GobEncode() ([]byte, error)
    GobEncode implements the encoding/gob.GobEncoder interface. The Float value
    and all its attributes (precision, rounding mode, accuracy) are marshaled.

func (x *Float) Int(z *Int) (*Int, Accuracy)
    Int returns the result of truncating x towards zero; or nil if x is an
    infinity. The result is Exact if x.IsInt(); otherwise it is Below for x > 0,
    and Above for x < 0. If a non-nil *Int argument z is provided, Int stores
    the result in z instead of allocating a new Int.

func (x *Float) Int64() (int64, Accuracy)
    Int64 returns the integer resulting from truncating x towards zero. If
    math.MinInt64 <= x <= math.MaxInt64, the result is Exact if x is an integer,
    and Above (x < 0) or Below (x > 0) otherwise. The result is (math.MinInt64,
    Above) for x < math.MinInt64, and (math.MaxInt64, Below) for x >
    math.MaxInt64.

func (x *Float) IsInf() bool
    IsInf reports whether x is +Inf or -Inf.

func (x *Float) IsInt() bool
    IsInt reports whether x is an integer. ±Inf values are not integers.

func (x *Float) MantExp(mant *Float) (exp int)
    MantExp breaks x into its mantissa and exponent components and returns
    the exponent. If a non-nil mant argument is provided its value is set
    to the mantissa of x, with the same precision and rounding mode as x.
    The components satisfy x == mant × 2**exp, with 0.5 <= |mant| < 1.0.
    Calling MantExp with a nil argument is an efficient way to get the exponent
    of the receiver.

    Special cases are:

        (  ±0).MantExp(mant) = 0, with mant set to   ±0
        (±Inf).MantExp(mant) = 0, with mant set to ±Inf

    x and mant may be the same in which case x is set to its mantissa value.

func (x *Float) MarshalText() (text []byte, err error)
    MarshalText implements the encoding.TextMarshaler interface. Only the Float
    value is marshaled (in full precision), other attributes such as precision
    or accuracy are ignored.

func (x *Float) MinPrec() uint
    MinPrec returns the minimum precision required to represent x exactly (i.e.,
    the smallest prec before x.SetPrec(prec) would start rounding x). The result
    is 0 for |x| == 0 and |x| == Inf.

func (x *Float) Mode() RoundingMode
    Mode returns the rounding mode of x.

func (z *Float) Mul(x, y *Float) *Float
    Mul sets z to the rounded product x*y and returns z. Precision, rounding,
    and accuracy reporting are as for Float.Add. Mul panics with ErrNaN if
    one operand is zero and the other operand an infinity. The value of z is
    undefined in that case.

func (z *Float) Neg(x *Float) *Float
    Neg sets z to the (possibly rounded) value of x with its sign negated,
    and returns z.

func (z *Float) Parse(s string, base int) (f *Float, b int, err error)
    Parse parses s which must contain a text representation of a floating- point
    number with a mantissa in the given conversion base (the exponent is always
    a decimal number), or a string representing an infinite value.

    For base 0, an underscore character “_” may appear between a base prefix
    and an adjacent digit, and between successive digits; such underscores do
    not change the value of the number, or the returned digit count. Incorrect
    placement of underscores is reported as an error if there are no other
    errors. If base != 0, underscores are not recognized and thus terminate
    scanning like any other character that is not a valid radix point or digit.

    It sets z to the (possibly rounded) value of the corresponding floating-
    point value, and returns z, the actual base b, and an error err, if any.
    The entire string (not just a prefix) must be consumed for success.
    If z's precision is 0, it is changed to 64 before rounding takes effect.
    The number must be of the form:

        number    = [ sign ] ( float | "inf" | "Inf" ) .
        sign      = "+" | "-" .
        float     = ( mantissa | prefix pmantissa ) [ exponent ] .
        prefix    = "0" [ "b" | "B" | "o" | "O" | "x" | "X" ] .
        mantissa  = digits "." [ digits ] | digits | "." digits .
        pmantissa = [ "_" ] digits "." [ digits ] | [ "_" ] digits | "." digits .
        exponent  = ( "e" | "E" | "p" | "P" ) [ sign ] digits .
        digits    = digit { [ "_" ] digit } .
        digit     = "0" ... "9" | "a" ... "z" | "A" ... "Z" .

    The base argument must be 0, 2, 8, 10, or 16. Providing an invalid base
    argument will lead to a run-time panic.

    For base 0, the number prefix determines the actual base: A prefix of
    “0b” or “0B” selects base 2, “0o” or “0O” selects base 8, and “0x” or “0X”
    selects base 16. Otherwise, the actual base is 10 and no prefix is accepted.
    The octal prefix "0" is not supported (a leading "0" is simply considered a
    "0").

    A "p" or "P" exponent indicates a base 2 (rather than base 10) exponent;
    for instance, "0x1.fffffffffffffp1023" (using base 0) represents the maximum
    float64 value. For hexadecimal mantissae, the exponent character must be
    one of 'p' or 'P', if present (an "e" or "E" exponent indicator cannot be
    distinguished from a mantissa digit).

    The returned *Float f is nil and the value of z is valid but not defined if
    an error is reported.

func (x *Float) Prec() uint
    Prec returns the mantissa precision of x in bits. The result may be 0 for
    |x| == 0 and |x| == Inf.

func (z *Float) Quo(x, y *Float) *Float
    Quo sets z to the rounded quotient x/y and returns z. Precision, rounding,
    and accuracy reporting are as for Float.Add. Quo panics with ErrNaN if both
    operands are zero or infinities. The value of z is undefined in that case.

func (x *Float) Rat(z *Rat) (*Rat, Accuracy)
    Rat returns the rational number corresponding to x; or nil if x is an
    infinity. The result is Exact if x is not an Inf. If a non-nil *Rat argument
    z is provided, Rat stores the result in z instead of allocating a new Rat.

func (z *Float) Scan(s fmt.ScanState, ch rune) error
    Scan is a support routine for fmt.Scanner; it sets z to the value of the
    scanned number. It accepts formats whose verbs are supported by fmt.Scan
    for floating point values, which are: 'b' (binary), 'e', 'E', 'f', 'F',
    'g' and 'G'. Scan doesn't handle ±Inf.

func (z *Float) Set(x *Float) *Float
    Set sets z to the (possibly rounded) value of x and returns z. If z's
    precision is 0, it is changed to the precision of x before setting z (and
    rounding will have no effect). Rounding is performed according to z's
    precision and rounding mode; and z's accuracy reports the result error
    relative to the exact (not rounded) result.

func (z *Float) SetFloat64(x float64) *Float
    SetFloat64 sets z to the (possibly rounded) value of x and returns z. If
    z's precision is 0, it is changed to 53 (and rounding will have no effect).
    SetFloat64 panics with ErrNaN if x is a NaN.

func (z *Float) SetInf(signbit bool) *Float
    SetInf sets z to the infinite Float -Inf if signbit is set, or +Inf if
    signbit is not set, and returns z. The precision of z is unchanged and the
    result is always Exact.

func (z *Float) SetInt(x *Int) *Float
    SetInt sets z to the (possibly rounded) value of x and returns z.
    If z's precision is 0, it is changed to the larger of x.BitLen() or 64 (and
    rounding will have no effect).

func (z *Float) SetInt64(x int64) *Float
    SetInt64 sets z to the (possibly rounded) value of x and returns z. If z's
    precision is 0, it is changed to 64 (and rounding will have no effect).

func (z *Float) SetMantExp(mant *Float, exp int) *Float
    SetMantExp sets z to mant × 2**exp and returns z. The result z has the
    same precision and rounding mode as mant. SetMantExp is an inverse of
    Float.MantExp but does not require 0.5 <= |mant| < 1.0. Specifically, for a
    given x of type *Float, SetMantExp relates to Float.MantExp as follows:

        mant := new(Float)
        new(Float).SetMantExp(mant, x.MantExp(mant)).Cmp(x) == 0

    Special cases are:

        z.SetMantExp(  ±0, exp) =   ±0
        z.SetMantExp(±Inf, exp) = ±Inf

    z and mant may be the same in which case z's exponent is set to exp.

func (z *Float) SetMode(mode RoundingMode) *Float
    SetMode sets z's rounding mode to mode and returns an exact z. z remains
    unchanged otherwise. z.SetMode(z.Mode()) is a cheap way to set z's accuracy
    to Exact.

func (z *Float) SetPrec(prec uint) *Float
    SetPrec sets z's precision to prec and returns the (possibly) rounded value
    of z. Rounding occurs according to z's rounding mode if the mantissa cannot
    be represented in prec bits without loss of precision. SetPrec(0) maps all
    finite values to ±0; infinite values remain unchanged. If prec > MaxPrec,
    it is set to MaxPrec.

func (z *Float) SetRat(x *Rat) *Float
    SetRat sets z to the (possibly rounded) value of x and returns z. If z's
    precision is 0, it is changed to the largest of a.BitLen(), b.BitLen(),
    or 64; with x = a/b.

func (z *Float) SetString(s string) (*Float, bool)
    SetString sets z to the value of s and returns z and a boolean indicating
    success. s must be a floating-point number of the same format as accepted
    by Float.Parse, with base argument 0. The entire string (not just a prefix)
    must be valid for success. If the operation failed, the value of z is
    undefined but the returned value is nil.

func (z *Float) SetUint64(x uint64) *Float
    SetUint64 sets z to the (possibly rounded) value of x and returns z. If z's
    precision is 0, it is changed to 64 (and rounding will have no effect).

func (x *Float) Sign() int
    Sign returns:
      - -1 if x < 0;
      - 0 if x is ±0;
      - +1 if x > 0.

func (x *Float) Signbit() bool
    Signbit reports whether x is negative or negative zero.

func (z *Float) Sqrt(x *Float) *Float
    Sqrt sets z to the rounded square root of x, and returns it.

    If z's precision is 0, it is changed to x's precision before the operation.
    Rounding is performed according to z's precision and rounding mode, but z's
    accuracy is not computed. Specifically, the result of z.Acc() is undefined.

    The function panics if z < 0. The value of z is undefined in that case.

func (x *Float) String() string
    String formats x like x.Text('g', 10). (String must be called explicitly,
    Float.Format does not support %s verb.)

func (z *Float) Sub(x, y *Float) *Float
    Sub sets z to the rounded difference x-y and returns z. Precision, rounding,
    and accuracy reporting are as for Float.Add. Sub panics with ErrNaN if x and
    y are infinities with equal signs. The value of z is undefined in that case.

func (x *Float) Text(format byte, prec int) string
    Text converts the floating-point number x to a string according to the given
    format and precision prec. The format is one of:

        'e'	-d.dddde±dd, decimal exponent, at least two (possibly 0) exponent digits
        'E'	-d.ddddE±dd, decimal exponent, at least two (possibly 0) exponent digits
        'f'	-ddddd.dddd, no exponent
        'g'	like 'e' for large exponents, like 'f' otherwise
        'G'	like 'E' for large exponents, like 'f' otherwise
        'x'	-0xd.dddddp±dd, hexadecimal mantissa, decimal power of two exponent
        'p'	-0x.dddp±dd, hexadecimal mantissa, decimal power of two exponent (non-standard)
        'b'	-ddddddp±dd, decimal mantissa, decimal power of two exponent (non-standard)

    For the power-of-two exponent formats, the mantissa is printed in normalized
    form:

        'x'	hexadecimal mantissa in [1, 2), or 0
        'p'	hexadecimal mantissa in [½, 1), or 0
        'b'	decimal integer mantissa using x.Prec() bits, or 0

    Note that the 'x' form is the one used by most other languages and
    libraries.

    If format is a different character, Text returns a "%" followed by the
    unrecognized format character.

    The precision prec controls the number of digits (excluding the exponent)
    printed by the 'e', 'E', 'f', 'g', 'G', and 'x' formats. For 'e', 'E',
    'f', and 'x', it is the number of digits after the decimal point. For 'g'
    and 'G' it is the total number of digits. A negative precision selects the
    smallest number of decimal digits necessary to identify the value x uniquely
    using x.Prec() mantissa bits. The prec value is ignored for the 'b' and 'p'
    formats.

func (x *Float) Uint64() (uint64, Accuracy)
    Uint64 returns the unsigned integer resulting from truncating x towards
    zero. If 0 <= x <= math.MaxUint64, the result is Exact if x is an
    integer and Below otherwise. The result is (0, Above) for x < 0, and
    (math.MaxUint64, Below) for x > math.MaxUint64.

func (z *Float) UnmarshalText(text []byte) error
    UnmarshalText implements the encoding.TextUnmarshaler interface. The result
    is rounded per the precision and rounding mode of z. If z's precision is 0,
    it is changed to 64 before rounding takes effect.

type Int struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    An Int represents a signed multi-precision integer. The zero value for an
    Int represents the value 0.

    Operations always take pointer arguments (*Int) rather than Int values,
    and each unique Int value requires its own unique *Int pointer. To "copy" an
    Int value, an existing (or newly allocated) Int must be set to a new value
    using the Int.Set method; shallow copies of Ints are not supported and may
    lead to errors.

    Note that methods may leak the Int's value through timing side-channels.
    Because of this and because of the scope and complexity of the
    implementation, Int is not well-suited to implement cryptographic
    operations. The standard library avoids exposing non-trivial Int methods
    to attacker-controlled inputs and the determination of whether a bug in
    math/big is considered a security vulnerability might depend on the impact
    on the standard library.

    Bit returns the value of the i'th bit of x. That is, it returns (x>>i)&1.
    The bit index i must be >= 0.

func (x *Int) BitLen() int
    BitLen returns the length of the absolute value of x in bits. The bit length
    of 0 is 0.

func (x *Int) Bits() []Word
    Bits provides raw (unchecked but fast) access to x by returning its absolute
    value as a little-endian Word slice. The result and x share the same
    underlying array. Bits is intended to support implementation of missing
    low-level Int functionality outside this package; it should be avoided
    otherwise.

func (x *Int) Bytes() []byte
    Bytes returns the absolute value of x as a big-endian byte slice.

    To use a fixed length slice, or a preallocated one, use Int.FillBytes.

      - +1 if |x| > |y|.

func (z *Int) Div(x, y *Int) *Int
    Div sets z to the quotient x/y for y != 0 and returns z. If y == 0,
    a division-by-zero run-time panic occurs. Div implements Euclidean division
    (unlike Go); see Int.DivMod for more details.

func (z *Int) DivMod(x, y, m *Int) (*Int, *Int)
    DivMod sets z to the quotient x div y and m to the modulus x mod y and
    returns the pair (z, m) for y != 0. If y == 0, a division-by-zero run-time
    panic occurs.

    DivMod implements Euclidean division and modulus (unlike Go):

        q = x div y  such that
        m = x - y*q  with 0 <= m < |y|

    (See Raymond T. Boute, “The Euclidean definition of the functions div and
    mod”. ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS),
    14(2):127-144, New York, NY, USA, 4/1992. ACM press.) See Int.QuoRem for
    T-division and modulus (like Go).

func (z *Int) Exp(x, y, m *Int) *Int
    Exp sets z = x**y mod |m| (i.e. the sign of m is ignored), and returns z.
    If m == nil or m == 0, z = x**y unless y <= 0 then z = 1. If m != 0, y < 0,
    and x and m are not relatively prime, z is unchanged and nil is returned.

    'o' (octal with 0 prefix), 'O' (octal with 0o prefix), 'd' (decimal),
    'x' (lowercase hexadecimal), and 'X' (uppercase hexadecimal). Also supported
    are the full suite of package fmt's format flags for integral types,
    including '+' and ' ' for sign control, '#' for leading zero in octal and
    for hexadecimal, a leading "0x" or "0X" for "%#x" and "%#X" respectively,
    specification of minimum digits precision, output field width, space or zero
    padding, and '-' for left or right justification.

func (z *Int) GCD(x, y, a, b *Int) *Int
    GCD sets z to the greatest common divisor of a and b and returns z. If x or
    y are not nil, GCD sets their value such that z = a*x + b*y.

    a and b may be positive, zero or negative. (Before Go 1.14 both had to be >
    0.) Regardless of the signs of a and b, z is always >= 0.

    If a == b == 0, GCD sets z = x = y = 0.

    If a == 0 and b != 0, GCD sets z = |b|, x = 0, y = sign(b) * 1.

    If a != 0 and b == 0, GCD sets z = |a|, x = sign(a) * 1, y = 0.

func (z *Int) GobDecode(buf []byte) error

func (x *Int) GobEncode() ([]byte, error)
    GobEncode implements the encoding/gob.GobEncoder interface.

    a division-by-zero run-time panic occurs. Mod implements Euclidean modulus
    (unlike Go); see Int.DivMod for more details.

func (z *Int) ModInverse(g, n *Int) *Int
    ModInverse sets z to the multiplicative inverse of g in the ring ℤ/nℤ and
    returns z. If g and n are not relatively prime, g has no multiplicative
    inverse in the ring ℤ/nℤ. In this case, z is unchanged and the return value
    is nil. If n == 0, a division-by-zero run-time panic occurs.

func (z *Int) ModSqrt(x, p *Int) *Int
    ModSqrt sets z to a square root of x mod p if such a square root exists, and
    returns z. The modulus p must be an odd prime. If x is not a square mod p,
    ModSqrt leaves z unchanged and returns nil. This function panics if p is not
    an odd integer, its behavior is undefined if p is odd but not prime.

    Or sets z = x | y and returns z.

func (x *Int) ProbablyPrime(n int) bool
    ProbablyPrime reports whether x is probably prime, applying the Miller-Rabin
    test with n pseudorandomly chosen bases as well as a Baillie-PSW test.

    If x is prime, ProbablyPrime returns true. If x is chosen randomly and not
    prime, ProbablyPrime probably returns false. The probability of returning
    true for a randomly chosen non-prime is at most ¼ⁿ.

    ProbablyPrime is 100% accurate for inputs less than 2⁶⁴. See Menezes et al.,
    Handbook of Applied Cryptography, 1997, pp. 145-149, and FIPS 186-4 Appendix
    F for further discussion of the error probabilities.

    ProbablyPrime is not suitable for judging primes that an adversary may have
    crafted to fool the test.

    As of Go 1.8, ProbablyPrime(0) is allowed and applies only a Baillie-PSW
    test. Before Go 1.8, ProbablyPrime applied only the Miller-Rabin tests,
    and ProbablyPrime(0) panicked.

func (z *Int) Quo(x, y *Int) *Int
    Quo sets z to the quotient x/y for y != 0 and returns z. If y == 0,
    a division-by-zero run-time panic occurs. Quo implements truncated division
    (like Go); see Int.QuoRem for more details.

func (z *Int) QuoRem(x, y, r *Int) (*Int, *Int)
    QuoRem sets z to the quotient x/y and r to the remainder x%y and returns the
    pair (z, r) for y != 0. If y == 0, a division-by-zero run-time panic occurs.

    QuoRem implements T-division and modulus (like Go):

        q = x/y      with the result truncated to zero
        r = x - y*q

    (See Daan Leijen, “Division and Modulus for Computer Scientists”.) See
    Int.DivMod for Euclidean division and modulus (unlike Go).

func (z *Int) Rand(rnd *rand.Rand, n *Int) *Int
    Rand sets z to a pseudo-random number in [0, n) and returns z.

    As this uses the math/rand package, it must not be used for
    security-sensitive work. Use crypto/rand.Int instead.

func (z *Int) Rem(x, y *Int) *Int
    Rem sets z to the remainder x%y for y != 0 and returns z. If y == 0,
    a division-by-zero run-time panic occurs. Rem implements truncated modulus
    (like Go); see Int.QuoRem for more details.

func (z *Int) SetBit(x *Int, i int, b uint) *Int
    SetBit sets z to x, with x's i'th bit set to b (0 or 1). That is,
      - if b is 1, SetBit sets z = x | (1 << i);
      - if b is 0, SetBit sets z = x &^ (1 << i);
      - if b is not 0 or 1, SetBit will panic.

func (z *Int) SetBits(abs []Word) *Int
    SetBits provides raw (unchecked but fast) access to z by setting its
    value to abs, interpreted as a little-endian Word slice, and returning z.
    The result and abs share the same underlying array. SetBits is intended to
    support implementation of missing low-level Int functionality outside this
    package; it should be avoided otherwise.

func (z *Int) SetBytes(buf []byte) *Int
    SetBytes interprets buf as the bytes of a big-endian unsigned integer,
    sets z to that value, and returns z.

func (z *Int) SetInt64(x int64) *Int
    SetInt64 sets z to x and returns z.

func (z *Int) SetString(s string, base int) (*Int, bool)
    SetString sets z to the value of s, interpreted in the given base,
    and returns z and a boolean indicating success. The entire string (not just
    a prefix) must be valid for success. If SetString fails, the value of z is
    undefined but the returned value is nil.

    The base argument must be 0 or a value between 2 and MaxBase. For base 0,
    the number prefix determines the actual base: A prefix of “0b” or “0B”
    selects base 2, “0”, “0o” or “0O” selects base 8, and “0x” or “0X” selects
    base 16. Otherwise, the selected base is 10 and no prefix is accepted.

    For bases <= 36, lower and upper case letters are considered the same: The
    letters 'a' to 'z' and 'A' to 'Z' represent digit values 10 to 35. For bases
    > 36, the upper case letters 'A' to 'Z' represent the digit values 36 to 61.

    For base 0, an underscore character “_” may appear between a base prefix
    and an adjacent digit, and between successive digits; such underscores do
    not change the value of the number. Incorrect placement of underscores is
    reported as an error if there are no other errors. If base != 0, underscores
    are not recognized and act like any other character that is not a valid
    digit.

func (z *Int) SetUint64(x uint64) *Int
    SetUint64 sets z to x and returns z.

func (x *Int) Sign() int

func (x *Int) Text(base int) string
    Text returns the string representation of x in the given base. Base must
    be between 2 and 62, inclusive. The result uses the lower-case letters 'a'
    to 'z' for digit values 10 to 35, and the upper-case letters 'A' to 'Z' for
    digit values 36 to 61. No prefix (such as "0x") is added to the string.
    If x is a nil pointer it returns "<nil>".

func (x *Int) TrailingZeroBits() uint
    TrailingZeroBits returns the number of consecutive least significant zero
    bits of |x|.

func (x *Int) Uint64() uint64

    Xor sets z = x ^ y and returns z.

type Rat struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Rat represents a quotient a/b of arbitrary precision. The zero value for a
    Rat represents the value 0.

    Operations always take pointer arguments (*Rat) rather than Rat values,
    and each unique Rat value requires its own unique *Rat pointer. To "copy" a
    Rat value, an existing (or newly allocated) Rat must be set to a new value
    using the Rat.Set method; shallow copies of Rats are not supported and may
    lead to errors.

    reference to x's denominator, unless x is an uninitialized (zero value) Rat,
    in which case the result is a new Int of value 1. (To initialize x,
    any operation that sets x will do, including x.Set(x).) If the result is a
    reference to x's denominator it may change if a new value is assigned to x,
    and vice versa.

func (x *Rat) Float32() (f float32, exact bool)
    Float32 returns the nearest float32 value for x and a bool indicating
    whether f represents x exactly. If the magnitude of x is too large to be
    represented by a float32, f is an infinity and exact is false. The sign of f
    always matches the sign of x, even if f == 0.

func (x *Rat) Float64() (f float64, exact bool)
    Float64 returns the nearest float64 value for x and a bool indicating
    whether f represents x exactly. If the magnitude of x is too large to be
    represented by a float64, f is an infinity and exact is false. The sign of f
    always matches the sign of x, even if f == 0.

func (x *Rat) FloatPrec() (n int, exact bool)
    FloatPrec returns the number n of non-repeating digits immediately following
    the decimal point of the decimal representation of x. The boolean result
    indicates whether a decimal representation of x with that many fractional
    digits is exact or rounded.

        x      n    exact    decimal representation n fractional digits
        0      0    true     0
        1      0    true     1
        1/2    1    true     0.5
        1/3    0    false    0       (0.333... rounded)
        1/4    2    true     0.25
        1/6    1    false    0.2     (0.166... rounded)

func (x *Rat) FloatString(prec int) string
    FloatString returns a string representation of x in decimal form with prec
    digits of precision after the radix point. The last digit is rounded to

    to x's numerator; it may change if a new value is assigned to x, and vice
    versa. The sign of the numerator corresponds to the sign of x.

func (z *Rat) Quo(x, y *Rat) *Rat

    SetInt64 sets z to x and returns z.

func (z *Rat) SetString(s string) (*Rat, bool)
    SetString sets z to the value of s and returns z and a boolean indicating
    success. s can be given as a (possibly signed) fraction "a/b", or as a
    floating-point number optionally followed by an exponent. If a fraction
    is provided, both the dividend and the divisor may be a decimal integer
    or independently use a prefix of “0b”, “0” or “0o”, or “0x” (or their
    upper-case variants) to denote a binary, octal, or hexadecimal integer,
    respectively. The divisor may not be signed. If a floating-point number is
    provided, it may be in decimal form or use any of the same prefixes as above
    but for “0” to denote a non-decimal mantissa. A leading “0” is considered a
    decimal leading 0; it does not indicate octal representation in this case.
    An optional base-10 “e” or base-2 “p” (or their upper-case variants)
    exponent may be provided as well, except for hexadecimal floats which
    only accept an (optional) “p” exponent (because an “e” or “E” cannot be
    distinguished from a mantissa digit). If the exponent's absolute value is
    too large, the operation may fail. The entire string, not just a prefix,
    must be valid for success. If the operation failed, the value of z is
    undefined but the returned value is nil.

type RoundingMode byte
    RoundingMode determines how a Float value is rounded to the desired
    precision. Rounding may change the Float value; the rounding error is
    described by the Float's Accuracy.

const (
	ToNearestEven RoundingMode = iota // == IEEE 754-2008 roundTiesToEven
	ToNearestAway                     // == IEEE 754-2008 roundTiesToAway
	ToZero                            // == IEEE 754-2008 roundTowardZero
	AwayFromZero                      // no IEEE 754-2008 equivalent
	ToNegativeInf                     // == IEEE 754-2008 roundTowardNegative
	ToPositiveInf                     // == IEEE 754-2008 roundTowardPositive
)
    These constants define supported rounding modes.
