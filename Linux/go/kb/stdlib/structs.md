Package structs defines marker types that can be used as struct fields to modify
the properties of a struct.

By convention, a marker type should be used as the type of a field named "_",
placed at the beginning of a struct type definition.

TYPES

type HostLayout struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    HostLayout marks a struct as using host memory layout. A struct with a
    field of type HostLayout will be laid out in memory according to host
    expectations, generally following the host's C ABI.

    HostLayout does not affect layout within any other struct-typed fields of
    the containing struct, nor does it affect layout of structs containing the
    struct marked as host layout.

    By convention, HostLayout should be used as the type of a field named "_",
    placed at the beginning of the struct type definition.
