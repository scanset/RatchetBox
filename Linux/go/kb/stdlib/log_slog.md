# log/slog (Go standard library)

Package slog provides structured logging, in which log records include a

Import path: log/slog   Toolchain: go1.26.4

package slog // import "log/slog"

Package slog provides structured logging, in which log records include a
message, a severity level, and various other attributes expressed as key-value
pairs.

It defines a type, Logger, which provides several methods (such as Logger.Info
and Logger.Error) for reporting events of interest.

Each Logger is associated with a Handler. A Logger output method creates a
Record from the method arguments and passes it to the Handler, which decides how
to handle it. There is a default Logger accessible through top-level functions
(such as Info and Error) that call the corresponding Logger methods.

A log record consists of a time, a level, a message, and a set of key-value
pairs, where the keys are strings and the values may be of any type. As an
example,

    slog.Info("hello", "count", 3)

creates a record containing the time of the call, a level of Info, the message
"hello", and a single pair with key "count" and value 3.

The Info top-level function calls the Logger.Info method on the default Logger.
In addition to Logger.Info, there are methods for Debug, Warn and Error levels.
Besides these convenience methods for common levels, there is also a Logger.Log
method which takes the level as an argument. Each of these methods has a
corresponding top-level function that uses the default logger.

The default handler formats the log record's message, time, level, and
attributes as a string and passes it to the log package.

    2022/11/08 15:28:26 INFO hello count=3

For more control over the output format, create a logger with a different
handler. This statement uses New to create a new logger with a TextHandler that
writes structured records in text form to standard error:

    logger := slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stderr, nil))

TextHandler output is a sequence of key=value pairs, easily and unambiguously
parsed by machine. This statement:

    logger.Info("hello", "count", 3)

produces this output:

    time=2022-11-08T15:28:26.000-05:00 level=INFO msg=hello count=3

The package also provides JSONHandler, whose output is line-delimited JSON:

    logger := slog.New(slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, nil))
    logger.Info("hello", "count", 3)

produces this output:

    {"time":"2022-11-08T15:28:26.000000000-05:00","level":"INFO","msg":"hello","count":3}

Both TextHandler and JSONHandler can be configured with HandlerOptions.
There are options for setting the minimum level (see Levels, below), displaying
the source file and line of the log call, and modifying attributes before they
are logged.

Setting a logger as the default with

    slog.SetDefault(logger)

will cause the top-level functions like Info to use it. SetDefault also updates
the default logger used by the log package, so that existing applications that
use log.Printf and related functions will send log records to the logger's
handler without needing to be rewritten.

Some attributes are common to many log calls. For example, you may wish to
include the URL or trace identifier of a server request with all log events
arising from the request. Rather than repeat the attribute with every log call,
you can use Logger.With to construct a new Logger containing the attributes:

    logger2 := logger.With("url", r.URL)

The arguments to With are the same key-value pairs used in Logger.Info.
The result is a new Logger with the same handler as the original, but additional
attributes that will appear in the output of every call.

# Levels

A Level is an integer representing the importance or severity of a log event.
The higher the level, the more severe the event. This package defines constants
for the most common levels, but any int can be used as a level.

In an application, you may wish to log messages only at a certain level or
greater. One common configuration is to log messages at Info or higher levels,
suppressing debug logging until it is needed. The built-in handlers can be
configured with the minimum level to output by setting HandlerOptions.Level. The
program's `main` function typically does this. The default value is LevelInfo.

Setting the HandlerOptions.Level field to a Level value fixes the handler's
minimum level throughout its lifetime. Setting it to a LevelVar allows the level
to be varied dynamically. A LevelVar holds a Level and is safe to read or write
from multiple goroutines. To vary the level dynamically for an entire program,
first initialize a global LevelVar:

    var programLevel = new(slog.LevelVar) // Info by default

Then use the LevelVar to construct a handler, and make it the default:

    h := slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stderr, &slog.HandlerOptions{Level: programLevel})
    slog.SetDefault(slog.New(h))

Now the program can change its logging level with a single statement:

    programLevel.Set(slog.LevelDebug)

# Groups

Attributes can be collected into groups. A group has a name that is used to
qualify the names of its attributes. How this qualification is displayed depends
on the handler. TextHandler separates the group and attribute names with a dot.
JSONHandler treats each group as a separate JSON object, with the group name as
the key.

Use Group to create a Group attribute from a name and a list of key-value pairs:

    slog.Group("request",
        "method", r.Method,
        "url", r.URL)

TextHandler would display this group as

    request.method=GET request.url=http://example.com

JSONHandler would display it as

    "request":{"method":"GET","url":"http://example.com"}

Use Logger.WithGroup to qualify all of a Logger's output with a group name.
Calling WithGroup on a Logger results in a new Logger with the same Handler as
the original, but with all its attributes qualified by the group name.

This can help prevent duplicate attribute keys in large systems, where
subsystems might use the same keys. Pass each subsystem a different Logger with
its own group name so that potential duplicates are qualified:

    logger := slog.Default().With("id", systemID)
    parserLogger := logger.WithGroup("parser")
    parseInput(input, parserLogger)

When parseInput logs with parserLogger, its keys will be qualified with
"parser", so even if it uses the common key "id", the log line will have
distinct keys.

# Contexts

Some handlers may wish to include information from the context.Context that is
available at the call site. One example of such information is the identifier
for the current span when tracing is enabled.

The Logger.Log and Logger.LogAttrs methods take a context as a first argument,
as do their corresponding top-level functions.

Although the convenience methods on Logger (Info and so on) and the
corresponding top-level functions do not take a context, the alternatives ending
in "Context" do. For example,

    slog.InfoContext(ctx, "message")

It is recommended to pass a context to an output method if one is available.

# Attrs and Values

An Attr is a key-value pair. The Logger output methods accept Attrs as well as
alternating keys and values. The statement

    slog.Info("hello", slog.Int("count", 3))

behaves the same as

    slog.Info("hello", "count", 3)

There are convenience constructors for Attr such as Int, String, and Bool for
common types, as well as the function Any for constructing Attrs of any type.

The value part of an Attr is a type called Value. Like an [any], a Value can
hold any Go value, but it can represent typical values, including all numbers
and strings, without an allocation.

For the most efficient log output, use Logger.LogAttrs. It is similar to
Logger.Log but accepts only Attrs, not alternating keys and values; this allows
it, too, to avoid allocation.

The call

    logger.LogAttrs(ctx, slog.LevelInfo, "hello", slog.Int("count", 3))

is the most efficient way to achieve the same output as

    slog.InfoContext(ctx, "hello", "count", 3)

# Customizing a type's logging behavior

If a type implements the LogValuer interface, the Value returned from its
LogValue method is used for logging. You can use this to control how values
of the type appear in logs. For example, you can redact secret information
like passwords, or gather a struct's fields in a Group. See the examples under
LogValuer for details.

A LogValue method may return a Value that itself implements LogValuer. The
Value.Resolve method handles these cases carefully, avoiding infinite loops and
unbounded recursion. Handler authors and others may wish to use Value.Resolve
instead of calling LogValue directly.

# Wrapping output methods

The logger functions use reflection over the call stack to find the file name
and line number of the logging call within the application. This can produce
incorrect source information for functions that wrap slog. For instance,
if you define this function in file mylog.go:

    func Infof(logger *slog.Logger, format string, args ...any) {
        logger.Info(fmt.Sprintf(format, args...))
    }

and you call it like this in main.go:

    Infof(slog.Default(), "hello, %s", "world")

then slog will report the source file as mylog.go, not main.go.

A correct implementation of Infof will obtain the source location (pc) and
pass it to NewRecord. The Infof function in the package-level example called
"wrapping" demonstrates how to do this.

# Working with Records

Sometimes a Handler will need to modify a Record before passing it on to another
Handler or backend. A Record contains a mixture of simple public fields (e.g.
Time, Level, Message) and hidden fields that refer to state (such as attributes)
indirectly. This means that modifying a simple copy of a Record (e.g. by calling
Record.Add or Record.AddAttrs to add attributes) may have unexpected effects on
the original. Before modifying a Record, use Record.Clone to create a copy that
shares no state with the original, or create a new Record with NewRecord and
build up its Attrs by traversing the old ones with Record.Attrs.

# Performance considerations

If profiling your application demonstrates that logging is taking significant
time, the following suggestions may help.

If many log lines have a common attribute, use Logger.With to create a Logger
with that attribute. The built-in handlers will format that attribute only once,
at the call to Logger.With. The Handler interface is designed to allow that
optimization, and a well-written Handler should take advantage of it.

The arguments to a log call are always evaluated, even if the log event is
discarded. If possible, defer computation so that it happens only if the value
is actually logged. For example, consider the call

    slog.Info("starting request", "url", r.URL.String())  // may compute String unnecessarily

The URL.String method will be called even if the logger discards Info-level
events. Instead, pass the URL directly:

    slog.Info("starting request", "url", &r.URL) // calls URL.String only if needed

The built-in TextHandler will call its String method, but only if the log event
is enabled. Avoiding the call to String also preserves the structure of the
underlying value. For example JSONHandler emits the components of the parsed
URL as a JSON object. If you want to avoid eagerly paying the cost of the String
call without causing the handler to potentially inspect the structure of the
value, wrap the value in a fmt.Stringer implementation that hides its Marshal
methods.

You can also use the LogValuer interface to avoid unnecessary work in disabled
log calls. Say you need to log some expensive value:

    slog.Debug("frobbing", "value", computeExpensiveValue(arg))

Even if this line is disabled, computeExpensiveValue will be called. To avoid
that, define a type implementing LogValuer:

    type expensive struct { arg int }

    func (e expensive) LogValue() slog.Value {
        return slog.AnyValue(computeExpensiveValue(e.arg))
    }

Then use a value of that type in log calls:

    slog.Debug("frobbing", "value", expensive{arg})

Now computeExpensiveValue will only be called when the line is enabled.

The built-in handlers acquire a lock before calling io.Writer.Write to ensure
that exactly one Record is written at a time in its entirety. Although each log
record has a timestamp, the built-in handlers do not use that time to sort the
written records. User-defined handlers are responsible for their own locking and
sorting.

TYPES

type Attr struct {
	Key   string
	Value Value
}
    An Attr is a key-value pair.

    the remaining arguments are converted to Attrs as in Logger.Log.

    Use Group to collect several key-value pairs under a single key on a
    log line, or as the result of LogValue in order to log a single value as
    multiple Attrs.

func String(key, value string) Attr
    String returns an Attr for a string value.

    Time returns an Attr for a time.Time. It discards the monotonic portion.

func Uint64(key string, v uint64) Attr
    Uint64 returns an Attr for a uint64.

func (a Attr) Equal(b Attr) bool
    Equal reports whether a and b have equal keys and values.

func (a Attr) String() string

type Handler interface {
	// Enabled reports whether the handler handles records at the given level.
	// The handler ignores records whose level is lower.
	// It is called early, before any arguments are processed,
	// to save effort if the log event should be discarded.
	// If called from a Logger method, the first argument is the context
	// passed to that method, or context.Background() if nil was passed
	// or the method does not take a context.
	// The context is passed so Enabled can use its values
	// to make a decision.
	Enabled(context.Context, Level) bool

	// Handle handles the Record.
	// It will only be called when Enabled returns true.
	// The Context argument is as for Enabled.
	// It is present solely to provide Handlers access to the context's values.
	// Canceling the context should not affect record processing.
	// (Among other things, log messages may be necessary to debug a
	// cancellation-related problem.)
	//
	// Handle methods that produce output should observe the following rules:
	//   - If r.Time is the zero time, ignore the time.
	//   - If r.PC is zero, ignore it.
	//   - Attr's values should be resolved.
	//   - If an Attr's key and value are both the zero value, ignore the Attr.
	//     This can be tested with attr.Equal(Attr{}).
	//   - If a group's key is empty, inline the group's Attrs.
	//   - If a group has no Attrs (even if it has a non-empty key),
	//     ignore it.
	//
	// [Logger] discards any errors from Handle. Wrap the Handle method to
	// process any errors from Handlers.
	Handle(context.Context, Record) error

	// WithAttrs returns a new Handler whose attributes consist of
	// both the receiver's attributes and the arguments.
	// The Handler owns the slice: it may retain, modify or discard it.
	WithAttrs(attrs []Attr) Handler

	// WithGroup returns a new Handler with the given group appended to
	// the receiver's existing groups.
	// The keys of all subsequent attributes, whether added by With or in a
	// Record, should be qualified by the sequence of group names.
	//
	// How this qualification happens is up to the Handler, so long as
	// this Handler's attribute keys differ from those of another Handler
	// with a different sequence of group names.
	//
	// A Handler should treat WithGroup as starting a Group of Attrs that ends
	// at the end of the log event. That is,
	//
	//     logger.WithGroup("s").LogAttrs(ctx, level, msg, slog.Int("a", 1), slog.Int("b", 2))
	//
	// should behave like
	//
	//     logger.LogAttrs(ctx, level, msg, slog.Group("s", slog.Int("a", 1), slog.Int("b", 2)))
	//
	// If the name is empty, WithGroup returns the receiver.
	WithGroup(name string) Handler
}
    A Handler handles log records produced by a Logger.

    A typical handler may print log records to standard error, or write them to
    a file or database, or perhaps augment them with additional attributes and
    pass them on to another handler.

    Any of the Handler's methods may be called concurrently with itself or
    with other methods. It is the responsibility of the Handler to manage this
    concurrency.

    Users of the slog package should not invoke Handler methods directly.
    They should use the methods of Logger instead.

    Before implementing your own handler, consult
    https://go.dev/s/slog-handler-guide.

var DiscardHandler Handler = discardHandler{}
    DiscardHandler discards all log output. DiscardHandler.Enabled returns false
    for all Levels.

type HandlerOptions struct {
	// AddSource causes the handler to compute the source code position
	// of the log statement and add a SourceKey attribute to the output.
	AddSource bool

	// Level reports the minimum record level that will be logged.
	// The handler discards records with lower levels.
	// If Level is nil, the handler assumes LevelInfo.
	// The handler calls Level.Level for each record processed;
	// to adjust the minimum level dynamically, use a LevelVar.
	Level Leveler

	// ReplaceAttr is called to rewrite each non-group attribute before it is logged.
	// The attribute's value has been resolved (see [Value.Resolve]).
	// If ReplaceAttr returns a zero Attr, the attribute is discarded.
	//
	// The built-in attributes with keys "time", "level", "source", and "msg"
	// are passed to this function, except that time is omitted
	// if zero, and source is omitted if AddSource is false.
	//
	// The first argument is a list of currently open groups that contain the
	// Attr. It must not be retained or modified. ReplaceAttr is never called
	// for Group attributes, only their contents. For example, the attribute
	// list
	//
	//     Int("a", 1), Group("g", Int("b", 2)), Int("c", 3)
	//
	// results in consecutive calls to ReplaceAttr with the following arguments:
	//
	//     nil, Int("a", 1)
	//     []string{"g"}, Int("b", 2)
	//     nil, Int("c", 3)
	//
	// ReplaceAttr can be used to change the default keys of the built-in
	// attributes, convert types (for example, to replace a `time.Time` with the
	// integer seconds since the Unix epoch), sanitize personal information, or
	// remove attributes from the output.
	ReplaceAttr func(groups []string, a Attr) Attr
}
    HandlerOptions are options for a TextHandler or JSONHandler. A zero
    HandlerOptions consists entirely of default values.

type JSONHandler struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    JSONHandler is a Handler that writes Records to an io.Writer as
    line-delimited JSON objects.

func NewJSONHandler(w io.Writer, opts *HandlerOptions) *JSONHandler
    NewJSONHandler creates a JSONHandler that writes to w, using the given
    options. If opts is nil, the default options are used.

func (h *JSONHandler) Enabled(_ context.Context, level Level) bool
    Enabled reports whether the handler handles records at the given level.
    The handler ignores records whose level is lower.

func (h *JSONHandler) Handle(_ context.Context, r Record) error
    Handle formats its argument Record as a JSON object on a single line.

    If the Record's time is zero, the time is omitted. Otherwise, the key is
    "time" and the value is output as with json.Marshal.

    The level's key is "level" and its value is the result of calling
    Level.String.

    If the AddSource option is set and source information is available, the key
    is "source", and the value is a record of type Source.

    The message's key is "msg".

    To modify these or other attributes, or remove them from the output,
    use HandlerOptions.ReplaceAttr.

    Values are formatted as with an encoding/json.Encoder with
    SetEscapeHTML(false), with two exceptions.

    First, an Attr whose Value is of type error is formatted as a string,
    by calling its Error method. Only errors in Attrs receive this special
    treatment, not errors embedded in structs, slices, maps or other data
    structures that are processed by the encoding/json package.

    Second, an encoding failure does not cause Handle to return an error.
    Instead, the error message is formatted as a string.

    Each call to Handle results in a single serialized call to io.Writer.Write.

func (h *JSONHandler) WithAttrs(attrs []Attr) Handler
    WithAttrs returns a new JSONHandler whose attributes consists of h's
    attributes followed by attrs.

func (h *JSONHandler) WithGroup(name string) Handler

type Kind int
    Kind is the kind of a Value.

const (
	KindAny Kind = iota
	KindBool
	KindDuration
	KindFloat64
	KindInt64
	KindString
	KindTime
	KindUint64
	KindGroup
	KindLogValuer
)
func (k Kind) String() string

type Level int
    A Level is the importance or severity of a log event. The higher the level,
    the more important or severe the event.

const (
	LevelDebug Level = -4
	LevelInfo  Level = 0
	LevelWarn  Level = 4
	LevelError Level = 8
)
    Names for common levels.

    Level numbers are inherently arbitrary, but we picked them to satisfy three
    constraints. Any system can map them to another numbering scheme if it
    wishes.

    First, we wanted the default level to be Info, Since Levels are ints,
    Info is the default value for int, zero.

    Second, we wanted to make it easy to use levels to specify logger verbosity.
    Since a larger level means a more severe event, a logger that accepts events
    with smaller (or more negative) level means a more verbose logger. Logger
    verbosity is thus the negation of event severity, and the default verbosity
    of 0 accepts all events at least as severe as INFO.

    Third, we wanted some room between levels to accommodate schemes with
    named levels between ours. For example, Google Cloud Logging defines a
    Notice level between Info and Warn. Since there are only a few of these
    intermediate levels, the gap between the numbers need not be large.
    Our gap of 4 matches OpenTelemetry's mapping. Subtracting 9 from an
    OpenTelemetry level in the DEBUG, INFO, WARN and ERROR ranges converts it to
    the corresponding slog Level range. OpenTelemetry also has the names TRACE
    and FATAL, which slog does not. But those OpenTelemetry levels can still be
    represented as slog Levels by using the appropriate integers.

func SetLogLoggerLevel(level Level) (oldLevel Level)
    SetLogLoggerLevel controls the level for the bridge to the log package.

    Before SetDefault is called, slog top-level logging functions call the
    default log.Logger. In that mode, SetLogLoggerLevel sets the minimum level
    for those calls. By default, the minimum level is Info, so calls to Debug
    (as well as top-level logging calls at lower levels) will not be passed to
    the log.Logger. After calling

        slog.SetLogLoggerLevel(slog.LevelDebug)

    calls to Debug will be passed to the log.Logger.

    After SetDefault is called, calls to the default log.Logger are passed to
    the slog default handler. In that mode, SetLogLoggerLevel sets the level at
    which those calls are logged. That is, after calling

        slog.SetLogLoggerLevel(slog.LevelDebug)

    A call to log.Printf will result in output at level LevelDebug.

    SetLogLoggerLevel returns the previous value.

func (l Level) AppendText(b []byte) ([]byte, error)
    AppendText implements encoding.TextAppender by calling Level.String.

func (l Level) Level() Level
    Level returns the receiver. It implements Leveler.

func (l Level) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)
    MarshalJSON implements encoding/json.Marshaler by quoting the output of
    Level.String.

func (l Level) MarshalText() ([]byte, error)
    MarshalText implements encoding.TextMarshaler by calling Level.AppendText.

func (l Level) String() string
    String returns a name for the level. If the level has a name, then that
    name in uppercase is returned. If the level is between named values, then an
    integer is appended to the uppercased name. Examples:

        LevelWarn.String() => "WARN"
        (LevelInfo+2).String() => "INFO+2"

func (l *Level) UnmarshalJSON(data []byte) error
    UnmarshalJSON implements encoding/json.Unmarshaler It accepts any string
    produced by Level.MarshalJSON, ignoring case. It also accepts numeric
    offsets that would result in a different string on output. For example,
    "Error-8" would marshal as "INFO".

func (l *Level) UnmarshalText(data []byte) error
    UnmarshalText implements encoding.TextUnmarshaler. It accepts any string
    produced by Level.MarshalText, ignoring case. It also accepts numeric
    offsets that would result in a different string on output. For example,
    "Error-8" would marshal as "INFO".

type LevelVar struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A LevelVar is a Level variable, to allow a Handler level to change
    dynamically. It implements Leveler as well as a Set method, and it is safe
    for use by multiple goroutines. The zero LevelVar corresponds to LevelInfo.

func (v *LevelVar) AppendText(b []byte) ([]byte, error)
    AppendText implements encoding.TextAppender by calling Level.AppendText.

func (v *LevelVar) Level() Level
    Level returns v's level.

func (v *LevelVar) MarshalText() ([]byte, error)
    MarshalText implements encoding.TextMarshaler by calling
    LevelVar.AppendText.

func (v *LevelVar) Set(l Level)
    Set sets v's level to l.

func (v *LevelVar) String() string

func (v *LevelVar) UnmarshalText(data []byte) error
    UnmarshalText implements encoding.TextUnmarshaler by calling
    Level.UnmarshalText.

type Leveler interface {
	Level() Level
}
    A Leveler provides a Level value.

    As Level itself implements Leveler, clients typically supply a Level value
    wherever a Leveler is needed, such as in HandlerOptions. Clients who need to
    vary the level dynamically can provide a more complex Leveler implementation
    such as *LevelVar.

type LogValuer interface {
	LogValue() Value
}
    A LogValuer is any Go value that can convert itself into a Value for
    logging.

    This mechanism may be used to defer expensive operations until they are
    needed, or to expand a single value into a sequence of components.

type Logger struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Logger records structured information about each call to its Log, Debug,
    Info, Warn, and Error methods. For each call, it creates a Record and passes
    it to a Handler.

    To create a new Logger, call New or a Logger method that begins "With".

func Default() *Logger
    Default returns the default Logger.

func New(h Handler) *Logger
    New creates a new Logger with the given non-nil Handler.

func With(args ...any) *Logger
    With calls Logger.With on the default logger.

func (l *Logger) Debug(msg string, args ...any)
    Debug logs at LevelDebug.

func (l *Logger) DebugContext(ctx context.Context, msg string, args ...any)
    DebugContext logs at LevelDebug with the given context.

func (l *Logger) Enabled(ctx context.Context, level Level) bool
    Enabled reports whether l emits log records at the given context and level.

func (l *Logger) Error(msg string, args ...any)
    Error logs at LevelError.

func (l *Logger) ErrorContext(ctx context.Context, msg string, args ...any)
    ErrorContext logs at LevelError with the given context.

func (l *Logger) Handler() Handler
    Handler returns l's Handler.

func (l *Logger) Info(msg string, args ...any)
    Info logs at LevelInfo.

func (l *Logger) InfoContext(ctx context.Context, msg string, args ...any)
    InfoContext logs at LevelInfo with the given context.

func (l *Logger) Log(ctx context.Context, level Level, msg string, args ...any)
    Log emits a log record with the current time and the given level and
    message. The Record's Attrs consist of the Logger's attributes followed by
    the Attrs specified by args.

    The attribute arguments are processed as follows:
      - If an argument is an Attr, it is used as is.
      - If an argument is a string and this is not the last argument, the
        following argument is treated as the value and the two are combined into
        an Attr.
      - Otherwise, the argument is treated as a value with key "!BADKEY".

func (l *Logger) LogAttrs(ctx context.Context, level Level, msg string, attrs ...Attr)
    LogAttrs is a more efficient version of Logger.Log that accepts only Attrs.

func (l *Logger) Warn(msg string, args ...any)
    Warn logs at LevelWarn.

func (l *Logger) WarnContext(ctx context.Context, msg string, args ...any)
    WarnContext logs at LevelWarn with the given context.

func (l *Logger) With(args ...any) *Logger
    With returns a Logger that includes the given attributes in each output
    operation. Arguments are converted to attributes as if by Logger.Log.

func (l *Logger) WithGroup(name string) *Logger
    WithGroup returns a Logger that starts a group, if name is non-empty.
    The keys of all attributes added to the Logger will be qualified by the
    given name. (How that qualification happens depends on the Handler.WithGroup
    method of the Logger's Handler.)

    If name is empty, WithGroup returns the receiver.

type MultiHandler struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    MultiHandler is a Handler that invokes all the given Handlers. Its Enabled
    method reports whether any of the handlers' Enabled methods return true.
    Its Handle, WithAttrs and WithGroup methods call the corresponding method on
    each of the enabled handlers.

func NewMultiHandler(handlers ...Handler) *MultiHandler
    NewMultiHandler creates a MultiHandler with the given Handlers.

func (h *MultiHandler) Enabled(ctx context.Context, l Level) bool

func (h *MultiHandler) Handle(ctx context.Context, r Record) error

func (h *MultiHandler) WithAttrs(attrs []Attr) Handler

func (h *MultiHandler) WithGroup(name string) Handler

type Record struct {
	// The time at which the output method (Log, Info, etc.) was called.
	Time time.Time

	// The log message.
	Message string

	// The level of the event.
	Level Level

	// The program counter at the time the record was constructed, as determined
	// by runtime.Callers. If zero, no program counter is available.
	//
	// The only valid use for this value is as an argument to
	// [runtime.CallersFrames]. In particular, it must not be passed to
	// [runtime.FuncForPC].
	PC uintptr

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Record holds information about a log event. Copies of a Record share
    state. Do not modify a Record after handing out a copy to it. Call NewRecord
    to create a new Record. Use Record.Clone to create a copy with no shared
    state.

func NewRecord(t time.Time, level Level, msg string, pc uintptr) Record
    NewRecord creates a Record from the given arguments. Use Record.AddAttrs to
    add attributes to the Record.

    NewRecord is intended for logging APIs that want to support a Handler as a
    backend.

func (r *Record) Add(args ...any)
    Add converts the args to Attrs as described in Logger.Log, then appends the
    Attrs to the Record's list of Attrs. It omits empty groups.

func (r *Record) AddAttrs(attrs ...Attr)
    AddAttrs appends the given Attrs to the Record's list of Attrs. It omits
    empty groups.

func (r Record) Attrs(f func(Attr) bool)
    Attrs calls f on each Attr in the Record. Iteration stops if f returns
    false.

func (r Record) Clone() Record
    Clone returns a copy of the record with no shared state. The original record
    and the clone can both be modified without interfering with each other.

func (r Record) NumAttrs() int
    NumAttrs returns the number of attributes in the Record.

func (r Record) Source() *Source
    Source returns a new Source for the log event using r's PC. If the PC field
    is zero, meaning the Record was created without the necessary information or
    the location is unavailable, then nil is returned.

type Source struct {
	// Function is the package path-qualified function name containing the
	// source line. If non-empty, this string uniquely identifies a single
	// function in the program. This may be the empty string if not known.
	Function string `json:"function"`
	// File and Line are the file name and line number (1-based) of the source
	// line. These may be the empty string and zero, respectively, if not known.
	File string `json:"file"`
	Line int    `json:"line"`
}
    Source describes the location of a line of source code.

type TextHandler struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    TextHandler is a Handler that writes Records to an io.Writer as a sequence
    of key=value pairs separated by spaces and followed by a newline.

func NewTextHandler(w io.Writer, opts *HandlerOptions) *TextHandler
    NewTextHandler creates a TextHandler that writes to w, using the given
    options. If opts is nil, the default options are used.

func (h *TextHandler) Enabled(_ context.Context, level Level) bool
    Enabled reports whether the handler handles records at the given level.
    The handler ignores records whose level is lower.

func (h *TextHandler) Handle(_ context.Context, r Record) error
    Handle formats its argument Record as a single line of space-separated
    key=value items.

    If the Record's time is zero, the time is omitted. Otherwise, the key is
    "time" and the value is output in RFC3339 format with millisecond precision.

    The level's key is "level" and its value is the result of calling
    Level.String.

    If the AddSource option is set and source information is available, the key
    is "source" and the value is output as FILE:LINE.

    The message's key is "msg".

    To modify these or other attributes, or remove them from the output,
    use HandlerOptions.ReplaceAttr.

    If a value implements encoding.TextMarshaler, the result of MarshalText is
    written. Otherwise, the result of fmt.Sprint is written.

    Keys and values are quoted with strconv.Quote if they contain Unicode space
    characters, non-printing characters, '"' or '='.

    Keys inside groups consist of components (keys or group names) separated by
    dots. No further escaping is performed. Thus there is no way to determine
    from the key "a.b.c" whether there are two groups "a" and "b" and a key "c",
    or a single group "a.b" and a key "c", or single group "a" and a key "b.c".
    If it is necessary to reconstruct the group structure of a key even in the
    presence of dots inside components, use HandlerOptions.ReplaceAttr to encode
    that information in the key.

    Each call to Handle results in a single serialized call to io.Writer.Write.

func (h *TextHandler) WithAttrs(attrs []Attr) Handler
    WithAttrs returns a new TextHandler whose attributes consists of h's
    attributes followed by attrs.

func (h *TextHandler) WithGroup(name string) Handler

type Value struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Value can represent any Go value, but unlike type any, it can represent
    most small values without an allocation. The zero Value corresponds to nil.

func AnyValue(v any) Value
    AnyValue returns a Value for the supplied value.

    If the supplied value is of type Value, it is returned unmodified.

    Given a value of one of Go's predeclared string, bool, or (non-complex)
    numeric types, AnyValue returns a Value of kind KindString, KindBool,
    KindUint64, KindInt64, or KindFloat64. The width of the original numeric
    type is not preserved.

    Given a time.Time or time.Duration value, AnyValue returns a Value of kind
    KindTime or KindDuration. The monotonic time is not preserved.

    For nil, or values of all other types, including named types whose
    underlying type is numeric, AnyValue returns a value of kind KindAny.

func BoolValue(v bool) Value
    BoolValue returns a Value for a bool.

func DurationValue(v time.Duration) Value
    DurationValue returns a Value for a time.Duration.

func Float64Value(v float64) Value
    Float64Value returns a Value for a floating-point number.

func GroupValue(as ...Attr) Value
    GroupValue returns a new Value for a list of Attrs. The caller must not
    subsequently mutate the argument slice.

func Int64Value(v int64) Value
    Int64Value returns a Value for an int64.

func IntValue(v int) Value
    IntValue returns a Value for an int.

func StringValue(value string) Value
    StringValue returns a new Value for a string.

func TimeValue(v time.Time) Value
    TimeValue returns a Value for a time.Time. It discards the monotonic
    portion.

func Uint64Value(v uint64) Value
    Uint64Value returns a Value for a uint64.

func (v Value) Any() any
    Any returns v's value as an any.

func (v Value) Bool() bool
    Bool returns v's value as a bool. It panics if v is not a bool.

func (v Value) Duration() time.Duration
    Duration returns v's value as a time.Duration. It panics if v is not a
    time.Duration.

func (v Value) Equal(w Value) bool
    Equal reports whether v and w represent the same Go value.

func (v Value) Float64() float64
    Float64 returns v's value as a float64. It panics if v is not a float64.

func (v Value) Group() []Attr
    Group returns v's value as a []Attr. It panics if v's Kind is not KindGroup.

func (v Value) Int64() int64
    Int64 returns v's value as an int64. It panics if v is not a signed integer.

func (v Value) Kind() Kind
    Kind returns v's Kind.

func (v Value) LogValuer() LogValuer
    LogValuer returns v's value as a LogValuer. It panics if v is not a
    LogValuer.

func (v Value) Resolve() (rv Value)
    Resolve repeatedly calls LogValue on v while it implements LogValuer,
    and returns the result. If v resolves to a group, the group's attributes'
    values are not recursively resolved. If the number of LogValue calls exceeds
    a threshold, a Value containing an error is returned. Resolve's return value
    is guaranteed not to be of Kind KindLogValuer.

func (v Value) String() string
    String returns Value's value as a string, formatted like fmt.Sprint.
    Unlike the methods Int64, Float64, and so on, which panic if v is of the
    wrong kind, String never panics.

func (v Value) Time() time.Time
    Time returns v's value as a time.Time. It panics if v is not a time.Time.

func (v Value) Uint64() uint64
    Uint64 returns v's value as a uint64. It panics if v is not an unsigned
    integer.
