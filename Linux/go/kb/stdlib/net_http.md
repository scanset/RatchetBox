# net/http (Go standard library)

Package http provides HTTP client and server implementations.

Import path: net/http   Toolchain: go1.26.4

package http // import "net/http"

Package http provides HTTP client and server implementations.

Get, Head, Post, and PostForm make HTTP (or HTTPS) requests:

    resp, err := http.Get("http://example.com/")
    ...
    resp, err := http.Post("http://example.com/upload", "image/jpeg", &buf)
    ...
    resp, err := http.PostForm("http://example.com/form",
    	url.Values{"key": {"Value"}, "id": {"123"}})

The caller must close the response body when finished with it:

    resp, err := http.Get("http://example.com/")
    if err != nil {
    	// handle error
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()
    body, err := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    // ...

# Clients and Transports

For control over HTTP client headers, redirect policy, and other settings,
create a Client:

    client := &http.Client{
    	CheckRedirect: redirectPolicyFunc,
    }

    resp, err := client.Get("http://example.com")
    // ...

    req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", "http://example.com", nil)
    // ...
    req.Header.Add("If-None-Match", `W/"wyzzy"`)
    resp, err := client.Do(req)
    // ...

For control over proxies, TLS configuration, keep-alives, compression, and other
settings, create a Transport:

    tr := &http.Transport{
    	MaxIdleConns:       10,
    	IdleConnTimeout:    30 * time.Second,
    	DisableCompression: true,
    }
    client := &http.Client{Transport: tr}
    resp, err := client.Get("https://example.com")

Clients and Transports are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines and
for efficiency should only be created once and re-used.

# Servers

ListenAndServe starts an HTTP server with a given address and handler.
The handler is usually nil, which means to use DefaultServeMux. Handle and
HandleFunc add handlers to DefaultServeMux:

    http.Handle("/foo", fooHandler)

    http.HandleFunc("/bar", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, %q", html.EscapeString(r.URL.Path))
    })

    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))

More control over the server's behavior is available by creating a custom
Server:

    s := &http.Server{
    	Addr:           ":8080",
    	Handler:        myHandler,
    	ReadTimeout:    10 * time.Second,
    	WriteTimeout:   10 * time.Second,
    	MaxHeaderBytes: 1 << 20,
    }
    log.Fatal(s.ListenAndServe())

# HTTP/2

The http package has transparent support for the HTTP/2 protocol.

Server and DefaultTransport automatically enable HTTP/2 support when using
HTTPS. Transport does not enable HTTP/2 by default.

To enable or disable support for HTTP/1, HTTP/2, and/or unencrypted HTTP/2,
see the Server.Protocols and Transport.Protocols configuration fields.

To configure advanced HTTP/2 features, see the Server.HTTP2 and Transport.HTTP2
configuration fields.

Alternatively, the following GODEBUG settings are currently supported:

    GODEBUG=http2client=0  # disable HTTP/2 client support
    GODEBUG=http2server=0  # disable HTTP/2 server support
    GODEBUG=http2debug=1   # enable verbose HTTP/2 debug logs
    GODEBUG=http2debug=2   # ... even more verbose, with frame dumps

The "omithttp2" build tag may be used to disable the HTTP/2 implementation
contained in the http package.

)
    HTTP status codes as registered with IANA. See:
    https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml

const DefaultMaxHeaderBytes = 1 << 20 // 1 MB
    DefaultMaxHeaderBytes is the maximum permitted size of the headers in an
    HTTP request. This can be overridden by setting Server.MaxHeaderBytes.

const DefaultMaxIdleConnsPerHost = 2
    DefaultMaxIdleConnsPerHost is the default value of Transport's
    MaxIdleConnsPerHost.

const TimeFormat = "Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 GMT"
    TimeFormat is the time format to use when generating times in HTTP headers.
    It is like time.RFC1123 but hard-codes GMT as the time zone. The time being
    formatted must be in UTC for Format to generate the correct format.

    For parsing this time format, see ParseTime.

const TrailerPrefix = "Trailer:"
    TrailerPrefix is a magic prefix for ResponseWriter.Header map keys that, if
    present, signals that the map entry is actually for the response trailers,
    and not the response headers. The prefix is stripped after the ServeHTTP
    call finishes and the values are sent in the trailers.

    This mechanism is intended only for trailers that are not known prior to the
    headers being written. If the set of trailers is fixed or known before the
    header is written, the normal Go trailers mechanism is preferred:

        https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ResponseWriter
        https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#example-ResponseWriter-Trailers

var (
	// ErrNotSupported indicates that a feature is not supported.

	ErrBodyNotAllowed = errors.New("http: request method or response status code does not allow body")

	// ErrHijacked is returned by ResponseWriter.Write calls when
	// the underlying connection has been hijacked using the

	ErrHijacked = errors.New("http: connection has been hijacked")

	// ErrContentLength is returned by ResponseWriter.Write calls
	// when a Handler set a Content-Length response header with a
	// declared size and then attempted to write more bytes than

	ErrContentLength = errors.New("http: wrote more than the declared Content-Length")

	// Deprecated: ErrWriteAfterFlush is no longer returned by
	// anything in the net/http package. Callers should not

	ErrWriteAfterFlush = errors.New("unused")
)
    Errors used by the HTTP server.

var (
	// ServerContextKey is a context key. It can be used in HTTP
	// handlers with Context.Value to access the server that
	// started the handler. The associated value will be of

	ServerContextKey = &contextKey{"http-server"}

	// LocalAddrContextKey is a context key. It can be used in

	// The associated value will be of type net.Addr.
	LocalAddrContextKey = &contextKey{"local-addr"}
)
var DefaultClient = &Client{}
    DefaultClient is the default Client and is used by Get, Head, and Post.

var DefaultServeMux = &defaultServeMux
    DefaultServeMux is the default ServeMux used by Serve.

var ErrAbortHandler = errors.New("net/http: abort Handler")
    ErrAbortHandler is a sentinel panic value to abort a handler. While any
    panic from ServeHTTP aborts the response to the client, panicking with
    ErrAbortHandler also suppresses logging of a stack trace to the server's
    error log.

var ErrBodyReadAfterClose = errors.New("http: invalid Read on closed Body")
    ErrBodyReadAfterClose is returned when reading a Request or Response Body
    after the body has been closed. This typically happens when the body is read
    after an HTTP Handler calls WriteHeader or Write on its ResponseWriter.

var ErrHandlerTimeout = errors.New("http: Handler timeout")
    ErrHandlerTimeout is returned on ResponseWriter Write calls in handlers
    which have timed out.

var ErrLineTooLong = internal.ErrLineTooLong
    ErrLineTooLong is returned when reading request or response bodies with
    malformed chunked encoding.

var ErrMissingFile = errors.New("http: no such file")
    ErrMissingFile is returned by FormFile when the provided file field name is
    either not present in the request or not a file field.

var ErrNoCookie = errors.New("http: named cookie not present")
    ErrNoCookie is returned by Request's Cookie method when a cookie is not
    found.

var ErrNoLocation = errors.New("http: no Location header in response")
    ErrNoLocation is returned by the Response.Location method when no Location
    header is present.

var ErrSchemeMismatch = errors.New("http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client")
    ErrSchemeMismatch is returned when a server returns an HTTP response to an
    HTTPS client.

var ErrServerClosed = errors.New("http: Server closed")
    ErrServerClosed is returned by the Server.Serve, ServeTLS, ListenAndServe,
    and ListenAndServeTLS methods after a call to Server.Shutdown or
    Server.Close.

var ErrSkipAltProtocol = errors.New("net/http: skip alternate protocol")
    ErrSkipAltProtocol is a sentinel error value defined by
    Transport.RegisterProtocol.

var ErrUseLastResponse = errors.New("net/http: use last response")
    ErrUseLastResponse can be returned by Client.CheckRedirect hooks to control
    how redirects are processed. If returned, the next request is not sent and
    the most recent response is returned with its body unclosed.

var NoBody = noBody{}
    NoBody is an io.ReadCloser with no bytes. Read always returns EOF and
    Close always returns nil. It can be used in an outgoing client request to
    explicitly signal that a request has zero bytes. An alternative, however,
    is to simply set Request.Body to nil.


FUNCTIONS

func CanonicalHeaderKey(s string) string
    CanonicalHeaderKey returns the canonical format of the header key s.
    The canonicalization converts the first letter and any letter following a
    hyphen to upper case; the rest are converted to lowercase. For example,
    the canonical key for "accept-encoding" is "Accept-Encoding". If s contains
    a space or invalid header field bytes, it is returned without modifications.

func DetectContentType(data []byte) string
    DetectContentType implements the algorithm described at
    https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/ to determine the Content-Type of
    the given data. It considers at most the first 512 bytes of data.
    DetectContentType always returns a valid MIME type: if it cannot determine a
    more specific one, it returns "application/octet-stream".

func Error(w ResponseWriter, error string, code int)
    Error replies to the request with the specified error message and HTTP code.
    It does not otherwise end the request; the caller should ensure no further
    writes are done to w. The error message should be plain text.

    Error deletes the Content-Length header, sets Content-Type to “text/plain;
    charset=utf-8”, and sets X-Content-Type-Options to “nosniff”. This
    configures the header properly for the error message, in case the caller had
    set it up expecting a successful output.

func Get(url string) (resp *Response, err error)
    Get issues a GET to the specified URL. If the response is one of the
    following redirect codes, Get follows the redirect, up to a maximum of 10
    redirects:

        301 (Moved Permanently)
        302 (Found)
        303 (See Other)
        307 (Temporary Redirect)
        308 (Permanent Redirect)

    An error is returned if there were too many redirects or if there was an
    HTTP protocol error. A non-2xx response doesn't cause an error. Any returned
    error will be of type *url.Error. The url.Error value's Timeout method will
    report true if the request timed out.

    When err is nil, resp always contains a non-nil resp.Body. Caller should
    close resp.Body when done reading from it.

    Get is a wrapper around DefaultClient.Get.

    To make a request with custom headers, use NewRequest and DefaultClient.Do.

    To make a request with a specified context.Context, use
    NewRequestWithContext and DefaultClient.Do.

func Handle(pattern string, handler Handler)
    Handle registers the handler for the given pattern in DefaultServeMux.
    The documentation for ServeMux explains how patterns are matched.

func HandleFunc(pattern string, handler func(ResponseWriter, *Request))
    HandleFunc registers the handler function for the given pattern in
    DefaultServeMux. The documentation for ServeMux explains how patterns are
    matched.

func Head(url string) (resp *Response, err error)
    Head issues a HEAD to the specified URL. If the response is one of the
    following redirect codes, Head follows the redirect, up to a maximum of 10
    redirects:

        301 (Moved Permanently)
        302 (Found)
        303 (See Other)
        307 (Temporary Redirect)
        308 (Permanent Redirect)

    Head is a wrapper around DefaultClient.Head.

    To make a request with a specified context.Context, use
    NewRequestWithContext and DefaultClient.Do.

func ListenAndServe(addr string, handler Handler) error
    ListenAndServe listens on the TCP network address addr and then calls
    Serve with handler to handle requests on incoming connections. Accepted
    connections are configured to enable TCP keep-alives.

    The handler is typically nil, in which case DefaultServeMux is used.

    ListenAndServe always returns a non-nil error.

func ListenAndServeTLS(addr, certFile, keyFile string, handler Handler) error
    ListenAndServeTLS acts identically to ListenAndServe, except that it expects
    HTTPS connections. Additionally, files containing a certificate and matching
    private key for the server must be provided. If the certificate is signed
    by a certificate authority, the certFile should be the concatenation of the
    server's certificate, any intermediates, and the CA's certificate.

func MaxBytesReader(w ResponseWriter, r io.ReadCloser, n int64) io.ReadCloser
    MaxBytesReader is similar to io.LimitReader but is intended for limiting
    the size of incoming request bodies. In contrast to io.LimitReader,
    MaxBytesReader's result is a ReadCloser, returns a non-nil error of type
    *MaxBytesError for a Read beyond the limit, and closes the underlying reader
    when its Close method is called.

    MaxBytesReader prevents clients from accidentally or maliciously sending
    a large request and wasting server resources. If possible, it tells the
    ResponseWriter to close the connection after the limit has been reached.

func NewRequest(method, url string, body io.Reader) (*Request, error)
    NewRequest wraps NewRequestWithContext using context.Background.

func NewRequestWithContext(ctx context.Context, method, url string, body io.Reader) (*Request, error)
    NewRequestWithContext returns a new Request given a method, URL, and
    optional body.

    If the provided body is also an io.Closer, the returned Request.Body is set
    to body and will be closed (possibly asynchronously) by the Client methods
    Do, Post, and PostForm, and Transport.RoundTrip.

    NewRequestWithContext returns a Request suitable for use with Client.Do
    or Transport.RoundTrip. To create a request for use with testing a
    Server Handler, either use the net/http/httptest.NewRequest function,
    use ReadRequest, or manually update the Request fields. For an outgoing
    client request, the context controls the entire lifetime of a request and
    its response: obtaining a connection, sending the request, and reading the
    response headers and body. See the Request type's documentation for the
    difference between inbound and outbound request fields.

    If body is of type *bytes.Buffer, *bytes.Reader, or *strings.Reader,
    the returned request's ContentLength is set to its exact value (instead of
    -1), GetBody is populated (so 307 and 308 redirects can replay the body),
    and Body is set to NoBody if the ContentLength is 0.

func NotFound(w ResponseWriter, r *Request)
    NotFound replies to the request with an HTTP 404 not found error.

func ParseCookie(line string) ([]*Cookie, error)
    ParseCookie parses a Cookie header value and returns all the cookies which
    were set in it. Since the same cookie name can appear multiple times the
    returned Values can contain more than one value for a given key.

func ParseHTTPVersion(vers string) (major, minor int, ok bool)
    ParseHTTPVersion parses an HTTP version string according to RFC 7230,
    section 2.6. "HTTP/1.0" returns (1, 0, true). Note that strings without a
    minor version, such as "HTTP/2", are not valid.

func ParseSetCookie(line string) (*Cookie, error)
    ParseSetCookie parses a Set-Cookie header value and returns a cookie.
    It returns an error on syntax error.

func ParseTime(text string) (t time.Time, err error)
    ParseTime parses a time header (such as the Date: header), trying each
    of the three formats allowed by HTTP/1.1: TimeFormat, time.RFC850,
    and time.ANSIC.

func Post(url, contentType string, body io.Reader) (resp *Response, err error)
    Post issues a POST to the specified URL.

    Caller should close resp.Body when done reading from it.

    If the provided body is an io.Closer, it is closed after the request.

    Post is a wrapper around DefaultClient.Post.

    To set custom headers, use NewRequest and DefaultClient.Do.

    See the Client.Do method documentation for details on how redirects are
    handled.

    To make a request with a specified context.Context, use
    NewRequestWithContext and DefaultClient.Do.

func PostForm(url string, data url.Values) (resp *Response, err error)
    PostForm issues a POST to the specified URL, with data's keys and values
    URL-encoded as the request body.

    The Content-Type header is set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
    To set other headers, use NewRequest and DefaultClient.Do.

    When err is nil, resp always contains a non-nil resp.Body. Caller should
    close resp.Body when done reading from it.

    PostForm is a wrapper around DefaultClient.PostForm.

    See the Client.Do method documentation for details on how redirects are
    handled.

    To make a request with a specified context.Context, use
    NewRequestWithContext and DefaultClient.Do.

func ProxyFromEnvironment(req *Request) (*url.URL, error)
    ProxyFromEnvironment returns the URL of the proxy to use for a given
    request, as indicated by the environment variables HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY
    and NO_PROXY (or the lowercase versions thereof). Requests use the proxy
    from the environment variable matching their scheme, unless excluded by
    NO_PROXY.

    The environment values may be either a complete URL or a "host[:port]",
    in which case the "http" scheme is assumed. An error is returned if the
    value is a different form.

    A nil URL and nil error are returned if no proxy is defined in the
    environment, or a proxy should not be used for the given request, as defined
    by NO_PROXY.

    As a special case, if req.URL.Host is "localhost" (with or without a port
    number), then a nil URL and nil error will be returned.

func ProxyURL(fixedURL *url.URL) func(*Request) (*url.URL, error)
    ProxyURL returns a proxy function (for use in a Transport) that always
    returns the same URL.

func ReadRequest(b *bufio.Reader) (*Request, error)
    ReadRequest reads and parses an incoming request from b.

    ReadRequest is a low-level function and should only be used for specialized
    applications; most code should use the Server to read requests and handle
    them via the Handler interface. ReadRequest only supports HTTP/1.x requests.
    For HTTP/2, use golang.org/x/net/http2.

func ReadResponse(r *bufio.Reader, req *Request) (*Response, error)
    ReadResponse reads and returns an HTTP response from r. The req parameter
    optionally specifies the Request that corresponds to this Response. If nil,
    a GET request is assumed. Clients must call resp.Body.Close when finished
    reading resp.Body. After that call, clients can inspect resp.Trailer to find
    key/value pairs included in the response trailer.

func Redirect(w ResponseWriter, r *Request, url string, code int)
    Redirect replies to the request with a redirect to url, which may be a
    path relative to the request path. Any non-ASCII characters in url will be
    percent-encoded, but existing percent encodings will not be changed.

    The provided code should be in the 3xx range and is usually
    StatusMovedPermanently, StatusFound or StatusSeeOther.

    If the Content-Type header has not been set, Redirect sets it to "text/html;
    charset=utf-8" and writes a small HTML body. Setting the Content-Type header
    to any value, including nil, disables that behavior.

func Serve(l net.Listener, handler Handler) error
    Serve accepts incoming HTTP connections on the listener l, creating a new
    service goroutine for each. The service goroutines read requests and then
    call handler to reply to them.

    The handler is typically nil, in which case DefaultServeMux is used.

    HTTP/2 support is only enabled if the Listener returns *tls.Conn connections
    and they were configured with "h2" in the TLS Config.NextProtos.

    Serve always returns a non-nil error.

func ServeContent(w ResponseWriter, req *Request, name string, modtime time.Time, content io.ReadSeeker)
    ServeContent replies to the request using the content in the provided
    ReadSeeker. The main benefit of ServeContent over io.Copy is that it
    handles Range requests properly, sets the MIME type, and handles If-Match,
    If-Unmodified-Since, If-None-Match, If-Modified-Since, and If-Range
    requests.

    If the response's Content-Type header is not set, ServeContent first
    tries to deduce the type from name's file extension and, if that fails,
    falls back to reading the first block of the content and passing it to
    DetectContentType. The name is otherwise unused; in particular it can be
    empty and is never sent in the response.

    If modtime is not the zero time or Unix epoch, ServeContent includes it
    in a Last-Modified header in the response. If the request includes an
    If-Modified-Since header, ServeContent uses modtime to decide whether the
    content needs to be sent at all.

    The content's Seek method must work: ServeContent uses a seek to the end
    of the content to determine its size. Note that *os.File implements the
    io.ReadSeeker interface.

    If the caller has set w's ETag header formatted per RFC 7232, section 2.3,
    ServeContent uses it to handle requests using If-Match, If-None-Match,
    or If-Range.

    If an error occurs when serving the request (for example, when handling
    an invalid range request), ServeContent responds with an error message.
    By default, ServeContent strips the Cache-Control, Content-Encoding,
    ETag, and Last-Modified headers from error responses. The GODEBUG setting
    httpservecontentkeepheaders=1 causes ServeContent to preserve these headers.

func ServeFile(w ResponseWriter, r *Request, name string)
    ServeFile replies to the request with the contents of the named file or
    directory.

    If the provided file or directory name is a relative path, it is interpreted
    relative to the current directory and may ascend to parent directories.
    If the provided name is constructed from user input, it should be sanitized
    before calling ServeFile.

    As a precaution, ServeFile will reject requests where r.URL.Path contains
    a ".." path element; this protects against callers who might unsafely
    use filepath.Join on r.URL.Path without sanitizing it and then use that
    filepath.Join result as the name argument.

    As another special case, ServeFile redirects any request where r.URL.Path
    ends in "/index.html" to the same path, without the final "index.html".
    To avoid such redirects either modify the path or use ServeContent.

    Outside of those two special cases, ServeFile does not use r.URL.Path
    for selecting the file or directory to serve; only the file or directory
    provided in the name argument is used.

func ServeFileFS(w ResponseWriter, r *Request, fsys fs.FS, name string)
    ServeFileFS replies to the request with the contents of the named file
    or directory from the file system fsys. The files provided by fsys must
    implement io.Seeker.

    If the provided name is constructed from user input, it should be sanitized
    before calling ServeFileFS.

    As a precaution, ServeFileFS will reject requests where r.URL.Path contains
    a ".." path element; this protects against callers who might unsafely
    use filepath.Join on r.URL.Path without sanitizing it and then use that
    filepath.Join result as the name argument.

    As another special case, ServeFileFS redirects any request where r.URL.Path
    ends in "/index.html" to the same path, without the final "index.html".
    To avoid such redirects either modify the path or use ServeContent.

    Outside of those two special cases, ServeFileFS does not use r.URL.Path
    for selecting the file or directory to serve; only the file or directory
    provided in the name argument is used.

func ServeTLS(l net.Listener, handler Handler, certFile, keyFile string) error
    ServeTLS accepts incoming HTTPS connections on the listener l, creating a
    new service goroutine for each. The service goroutines read requests and
    then call handler to reply to them.

    The handler is typically nil, in which case DefaultServeMux is used.

    Additionally, files containing a certificate and matching private key for
    the server must be provided. If the certificate is signed by a certificate
    authority, the certFile should be the concatenation of the server's
    certificate, any intermediates, and the CA's certificate.

    ServeTLS always returns a non-nil error.

func SetCookie(w ResponseWriter, cookie *Cookie)
    SetCookie adds a Set-Cookie header to the provided ResponseWriter's headers.
    The provided cookie must have a valid Name. Invalid cookies may be silently
    dropped.

func StatusText(code int) string
    StatusText returns a text for the HTTP status code. It returns the empty
    string if the code is unknown.


TYPES

type Client struct {
	// Transport specifies the mechanism by which individual
	// HTTP requests are made.
	// If nil, DefaultTransport is used.
	Transport RoundTripper

	// CheckRedirect specifies the policy for handling redirects.
	// If CheckRedirect is not nil, the client calls it before
	// following an HTTP redirect. The arguments req and via are
	// the upcoming request and the requests made already, oldest
	// first. If CheckRedirect returns an error, the Client's Get
	// method returns both the previous Response (with its Body
	// closed) and CheckRedirect's error (wrapped in a url.Error)
	// instead of issuing the Request req.
	// As a special case, if CheckRedirect returns ErrUseLastResponse,
	// then the most recent response is returned with its body
	// unclosed, along with a nil error.
	//
	// If CheckRedirect is nil, the Client uses its default policy,
	// which is to stop after 10 consecutive requests.
	CheckRedirect func(req *Request, via []*Request) error

	// Jar specifies the cookie jar.
	//
	// The Jar is used to insert relevant cookies into every
	// outbound Request and is updated with the cookie values
	// of every inbound Response. The Jar is consulted for every
	// redirect that the Client follows.
	//
	// If Jar is nil, cookies are only sent if they are explicitly
	// set on the Request.
	Jar CookieJar

	// Timeout specifies a time limit for requests made by this
	// Client. The timeout includes connection time, any
	// redirects, and reading the response body. The timer remains
	// running after Get, Head, Post, or Do return and will
	// interrupt reading of the Response.Body.
	//
	// A Timeout of zero means no timeout.
	//
	// The Client cancels requests to the underlying Transport
	// as if the Request's Context ended.
	//
	// For compatibility, the Client will also use the deprecated
	// CancelRequest method on Transport if found. New
	// RoundTripper implementations should use the Request's Context
	// for cancellation instead of implementing CancelRequest.
	Timeout time.Duration
}
    A Client is an HTTP client. Its zero value (DefaultClient) is a usable
    client that uses DefaultTransport.

    The Client.Transport typically has internal state (cached TCP connections),
    so Clients should be reused instead of created as needed. Clients are safe
    for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.

    A Client is higher-level than a RoundTripper (such as Transport) and
    additionally handles HTTP details such as cookies and redirects.

    When following redirects, the Client will forward all headers set on the
    initial Request except:

      - when forwarding sensitive headers like "Authorization",
        "WWW-Authenticate", and "Cookie" to untrusted targets. These headers
        will be ignored when following a redirect to a domain that is not a
        subdomain match or exact match of the initial domain. For example,
        a redirect from "foo.com" to either "foo.com" or "sub.foo.com" will
        forward the sensitive headers, but a redirect to "bar.com" will not.
      - when forwarding the "Cookie" header with a non-nil cookie Jar.
        Since each redirect may mutate the state of the cookie jar,
        a redirect may possibly alter a cookie set in the initial request. When
        forwarding the "Cookie" header, any mutated cookies will be omitted,
        with the expectation that the Jar will insert those mutated cookies
        with the updated values (assuming the origin matches). If Jar is nil,
        the initial cookies are forwarded without change.

func (c *Client) CloseIdleConnections()
    CloseIdleConnections closes any connections on its Transport which were
    previously connected from previous requests but are now sitting idle in a
    "keep-alive" state. It does not interrupt any connections currently in use.

    If Client.Transport does not have a Client.CloseIdleConnections method then
    this method does nothing.

func (c *Client) Do(req *Request) (*Response, error)
    Do sends an HTTP request and returns an HTTP response, following policy
    (such as redirects, cookies, auth) as configured on the client.

    An error is returned if caused by client policy (such as CheckRedirect),
    or failure to speak HTTP (such as a network connectivity problem). A non-2xx
    status code doesn't cause an error.

    If the returned error is nil, the Response will contain a non-nil Body
    which the user is expected to close. If the Body is not both read to EOF and
    closed, the Client's underlying RoundTripper (typically Transport) may not
    be able to re-use a persistent TCP connection to the server for a subsequent
    "keep-alive" request.

    The request Body, if non-nil, will be closed by the underlying Transport,
    even on errors. The Body may be closed asynchronously after Do returns.

    On error, any Response can be ignored. A non-nil Response with a non-nil
    error only occurs when CheckRedirect fails, and even then the returned
    Response.Body is already closed.

    Generally Get, Post, or PostForm will be used instead of Do.

    If the server replies with a redirect, the Client first uses the
    CheckRedirect function to determine whether the redirect should be followed.
    If permitted, a 301, 302, or 303 redirect causes subsequent requests to use
    HTTP method GET (or HEAD if the original request was HEAD), with no body.
    A 307 or 308 redirect preserves the original HTTP method and body, provided
    that the Request.GetBody function is defined. The NewRequest function
    automatically sets GetBody for common standard library body types.

    Any returned error will be of type *url.Error. The url.Error value's Timeout
    method will report true if the request timed out.

func (c *Client) Get(url string) (resp *Response, err error)
    Get issues a GET to the specified URL. If the response is one of the
    following redirect codes, Get follows the redirect after calling the
    Client.CheckRedirect function:

        301 (Moved Permanently)
        302 (Found)
        303 (See Other)
        307 (Temporary Redirect)
        308 (Permanent Redirect)

    An error is returned if the Client.CheckRedirect function fails or if there
    was an HTTP protocol error. A non-2xx response doesn't cause an error.
    Any returned error will be of type *url.Error. The url.Error value's Timeout
    method will report true if the request timed out.

    When err is nil, resp always contains a non-nil resp.Body. Caller should
    close resp.Body when done reading from it.

    To make a request with custom headers, use NewRequest and Client.Do.

    To make a request with a specified context.Context, use
    NewRequestWithContext and Client.Do.

func (c *Client) Head(url string) (resp *Response, err error)
    Head issues a HEAD to the specified URL. If the response is one of the
    following redirect codes, Head follows the redirect after calling the
    Client.CheckRedirect function:

        301 (Moved Permanently)
        302 (Found)
        303 (See Other)
        307 (Temporary Redirect)
        308 (Permanent Redirect)

    To make a request with a specified context.Context, use
    NewRequestWithContext and Client.Do.

func (c *Client) Post(url, contentType string, body io.Reader) (resp *Response, err error)
    Post issues a POST to the specified URL.

    Caller should close resp.Body when done reading from it.

    If the provided body is an io.Closer, it is closed after the request.

    To set custom headers, use NewRequest and Client.Do.

    To make a request with a specified context.Context, use
    NewRequestWithContext and Client.Do.

    See the Client.Do method documentation for details on how redirects are
    handled.

func (c *Client) PostForm(url string, data url.Values) (resp *Response, err error)
    PostForm issues a POST to the specified URL, with data's keys and values
    URL-encoded as the request body.

    The Content-Type header is set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
    To set other headers, use NewRequest and Client.Do.

    When err is nil, resp always contains a non-nil resp.Body. Caller should
    close resp.Body when done reading from it.

    See the Client.Do method documentation for details on how redirects are
    handled.

    To make a request with a specified context.Context, use
    NewRequestWithContext and Client.Do.

type ClientConn struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A ClientConn is a client connection to an HTTP server.

    Unlike a Transport, a ClientConn represents a single connection. Most users
    should use a Transport rather than creating client connections directly.

func (cc *ClientConn) Available() int
    Available reports the number of requests that may be sent to the connection
    without blocking. It returns 0 if the connection is closed.

func (cc *ClientConn) Close() error
    Close closes the connection. Outstanding RoundTrip calls are interrupted.

func (cc *ClientConn) Err() error
    Err reports any fatal connection errors. It returns nil if the connection is
    usable. If it returns non-nil, the connection can no longer be used.

func (cc *ClientConn) InFlight() int
    InFlight reports the number of requests in flight, including reserved
    requests. It returns 0 if the connection is closed.

func (cc *ClientConn) Release()
    Release releases an unused concurrency slot reserved by Reserve. If there
    are no reserved concurrency slots, it has no effect.

func (cc *ClientConn) Reserve() error
    Reserve reserves a concurrency slot on the connection. If Reserve returns
    nil, one additional RoundTrip call may be made without waiting for an
    existing request to complete.

    The reserved concurrency slot is accounted as an in-flight request.
    A successful call to RoundTrip will decrement the Available count and
    increment the InFlight count.

    Each successful call to Reserve should be followed by exactly one call to
    RoundTrip or Release, which will consume or release the reservation.

    If the connection is closed or at its concurrency limit, Reserve returns an
    error.

func (cc *ClientConn) RoundTrip(req *Request) (*Response, error)
    RoundTrip implements the RoundTripper interface.

    The request is sent on the client connection, regardless of the URL being
    requested or any proxy settings.

    If the connection is at its concurrency limit, RoundTrip waits for the
    connection to become available before sending the request.

func (cc *ClientConn) SetStateHook(f func(*ClientConn))
    SetStateHook arranges for f to be called when the state of the connection
    changes. At most one call to f is made at a time. If the connection's
    state has changed since it was created, f is called immediately in a
    separate goroutine. f may be called synchronously from RoundTrip or
    Response.Body.Close.

    If SetStateHook is called multiple times, the new hook replaces the old one.
    If f is nil, no further calls will be made to f after SetStateHook returns.

    f is called when Available increases (more requests may be sent on the
    connection), InFlight decreases (existing requests complete), or Err begins
    returning non-nil (the connection is no longer usable).

type CloseNotifier interface {
	// CloseNotify returns a channel that receives at most a
	// single value (true) when the client connection has gone
	// away.
	//
	// CloseNotify may wait to notify until Request.Body has been
	// fully read.
	//
	// After the Handler has returned, there is no guarantee
	// that the channel receives a value.
	//
	// If the protocol is HTTP/1.1 and CloseNotify is called while
	// processing an idempotent request (such as GET) while
	// HTTP/1.1 pipelining is in use, the arrival of a subsequent
	// pipelined request may cause a value to be sent on the
	// returned channel. In practice HTTP/1.1 pipelining is not
	// enabled in browsers and not seen often in the wild. If this
	// is a problem, use HTTP/2 or only use CloseNotify on methods
	// such as POST.
	CloseNotify() <-chan bool
}
    The CloseNotifier interface is implemented by ResponseWriters which allow
    detecting when the underlying connection has gone away.

    This mechanism can be used to cancel long operations on the server if the
    client has disconnected before the response is ready.

    Deprecated: the CloseNotifier interface predates Go's context package.
    New code should use Request.Context instead.

type ConnState int
    A ConnState represents the state of a client connection to a server.
    It's used by the optional Server.ConnState hook.

const (
	// StateNew represents a new connection that is expected to
	// send a request immediately. Connections begin at this
	// state and then transition to either StateActive or
	// StateClosed.
	StateNew ConnState = iota

	// StateActive represents a connection that has read 1 or more
	// bytes of a request. The Server.ConnState hook for
	// StateActive fires before the request has entered a handler
	// and doesn't fire again until the request has been
	// handled. After the request is handled, the state
	// transitions to StateClosed, StateHijacked, or StateIdle.
	// For HTTP/2, StateActive fires on the transition from zero
	// to one active request, and only transitions away once all
	// active requests are complete. That means that ConnState
	// cannot be used to do per-request work; ConnState only notes
	// the overall state of the connection.
	StateActive

	// StateIdle represents a connection that has finished
	// handling a request and is in the keep-alive state, waiting
	// for a new request. Connections transition from StateIdle
	// to either StateActive or StateClosed.
	StateIdle

	// StateHijacked represents a hijacked connection.
	// This is a terminal state. It does not transition to StateClosed.
	StateHijacked

	// StateClosed represents a closed connection.
	// This is a terminal state. Hijacked connections do not
	// transition to StateClosed.
	StateClosed
)
func (c ConnState) String() string

type Cookie struct {
	Name   string
	Value  string
	Quoted bool // indicates whether the Value was originally quoted

	Path       string    // optional
	Domain     string    // optional
	Expires    time.Time // optional
	RawExpires string    // for reading cookies only

	// MaxAge=0 means no 'Max-Age' attribute specified.
	// MaxAge<0 means delete cookie now, equivalently 'Max-Age: 0'
	// MaxAge>0 means Max-Age attribute present and given in seconds
	MaxAge      int
	Secure      bool
	HttpOnly    bool
	SameSite    SameSite
	Partitioned bool
	Raw         string
	Unparsed    []string // Raw text of unparsed attribute-value pairs
}
    A Cookie represents an HTTP cookie as sent in the Set-Cookie header of an
    HTTP response or the Cookie header of an HTTP request.

    See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265 for details.

func (c *Cookie) String() string
    String returns the serialization of the cookie for use in a Cookie header
    (if only Name and Value are set) or a Set-Cookie response header (if other
    fields are set). If c is nil or c.Name is invalid, the empty string is
    returned.

func (c *Cookie) Valid() error
    Valid reports whether the cookie is valid.

type CookieJar interface {
	// SetCookies handles the receipt of the cookies in a reply for the
	// given URL.  It may or may not choose to save the cookies, depending
	// on the jar's policy and implementation.
	SetCookies(u *url.URL, cookies []*Cookie)

	// Cookies returns the cookies to send in a request for the given URL.
	// It is up to the implementation to honor the standard cookie use
	// restrictions such as in RFC 6265.
	Cookies(u *url.URL) []*Cookie
}
    A CookieJar manages storage and use of cookies in HTTP requests.

    Implementations of CookieJar must be safe for concurrent use by multiple
    goroutines.

    The net/http/cookiejar package provides a CookieJar implementation.

type CrossOriginProtection struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    CrossOriginProtection implements protections against Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF) by rejecting non-safe cross-origin browser requests.

    Cross-origin requests are currently detected with the Sec-Fetch-Site header,
    available in all browsers since 2023, or by comparing the hostname of the
    Origin header with the Host header.

    The GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS methods are safe methods and are always allowed.
    It's important that applications do not perform any state changing actions
    due to requests with safe methods.

    Requests without Sec-Fetch-Site or Origin headers are currently assumed to
    be either same-origin or non-browser requests, and are allowed.

    The zero value of CrossOriginProtection is valid and has no trusted origins
    or bypass patterns.

[Sec-Fetch-Site]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Site
[Origin]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin
[Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/CSRF
[safe methods]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Safe/HTTP

func NewCrossOriginProtection() *CrossOriginProtection
    NewCrossOriginProtection returns a new CrossOriginProtection value.

func (c *CrossOriginProtection) AddInsecureBypassPattern(pattern string)
    AddInsecureBypassPattern permits all requests that match the given pattern.

    The pattern syntax and precedence rules are the same as ServeMux.
    Only requests that match the pattern directly are permitted. Those that
    ServeMux would redirect to a pattern (e.g. after cleaning the path or adding
    a trailing slash) are not.

    AddInsecureBypassPattern panics if the pattern conflicts with one already
    registered, or if the pattern is syntactically invalid (for example,
    an improperly formed wildcard).

    AddInsecureBypassPattern can be called concurrently with other methods or
    request handling, and applies to future requests.

func (c *CrossOriginProtection) AddTrustedOrigin(origin string) error
    AddTrustedOrigin allows all requests with an Origin header which exactly
    matches the given value.

    Origin header values are of the form "scheme://host[:port]".

    AddTrustedOrigin can be called concurrently with other methods or request
    handling, and applies to future requests.

[Origin]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin

func (c *CrossOriginProtection) Check(req *Request) error
    Check applies cross-origin checks to a request. It returns an error if the
    request should be rejected.

func (c *CrossOriginProtection) Handler(h Handler) Handler
    Handler returns a handler that applies cross-origin checks before invoking
    the handler h.

    If a request fails cross-origin checks, the request is rejected
    with a 403 Forbidden status or handled with the handler passed to
    CrossOriginProtection.SetDenyHandler.

func (c *CrossOriginProtection) SetDenyHandler(h Handler)
    SetDenyHandler sets a handler to invoke when a request is rejected.
    The default error handler responds with a 403 Forbidden status.

    SetDenyHandler can be called concurrently with other methods or request
    handling, and applies to future requests.

    Check does not call the error handler.

type Dir string
    A Dir implements FileSystem using the native file system restricted to a
    specific directory tree.

    While the FileSystem.Open method takes '/'-separated paths, a Dir's string
    value is a directory path on the native file system, not a URL, so it is
    separated by filepath.Separator, which isn't necessarily '/'.

    Note that Dir could expose sensitive files and directories. Dir will
    follow symlinks pointing out of the directory tree, which can be especially
    dangerous if serving from a directory in which users are able to create
    arbitrary symlinks. Dir will also allow access to files and directories
    starting with a period, which could expose sensitive directories like .git
    or sensitive files like .htpasswd. To exclude files with a leading period,
    remove the files/directories from the server or create a custom FileSystem
    implementation.

    An empty Dir is treated as ".".

func (d Dir) Open(name string) (File, error)
    Open implements FileSystem using os.Open, opening files for reading rooted
    and relative to the directory d.

type File interface {
	io.Closer
	io.Reader
	io.Seeker
	Readdir(count int) ([]fs.FileInfo, error)
	Stat() (fs.FileInfo, error)
}
    A File is returned by a FileSystem's Open method and can be served by the
    FileServer implementation.

    The methods should behave the same as those on an *os.File.

type FileSystem interface {
	Open(name string) (File, error)
}
    A FileSystem implements access to a collection of named files. The elements
    in a file path are separated by slash ('/', U+002F) characters, regardless
    of host operating system convention. See the FileServer function to convert
    a FileSystem to a Handler.

    This interface predates the fs.FS interface, which can be used instead:
    the FS adapter function converts an fs.FS to a FileSystem.

func FS(fsys fs.FS) FileSystem
    FS converts fsys to a FileSystem implementation, for use with FileServer and
    NewFileTransport. The files provided by fsys must implement io.Seeker.

type Flusher interface {
	// Flush sends any buffered data to the client.
	Flush()
}
    The Flusher interface is implemented by ResponseWriters that allow an HTTP
    handler to flush buffered data to the client.

    The default HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2 ResponseWriter implementations support
    Flusher, but ResponseWriter wrappers may not. Handlers should always test
    for this ability at runtime.

    Note that even for ResponseWriters that support Flush, if the client is
    connected through an HTTP proxy, the buffered data may not reach the client
    until the response completes.

type HTTP2Config struct {
	// MaxConcurrentStreams optionally specifies the number of
	// concurrent streams that a client may have open at a time.
	// If zero, MaxConcurrentStreams defaults to at least 100.
	//
	// This parameter only applies to Servers.
	MaxConcurrentStreams int

	// StrictMaxConcurrentRequests controls whether an HTTP/2 server's
	// concurrency limit should be respected across all connections
	// to that server.
	// If true, new requests sent when a connection's concurrency limit
	// has been exceeded will block until an existing request completes.
	// If false, an additional connection will be opened if all
	// existing connections are at their limit.
	//
	// This parameter only applies to Transports.
	StrictMaxConcurrentRequests bool

	// MaxDecoderHeaderTableSize optionally specifies an upper limit for the
	// size of the header compression table used for decoding headers sent
	// by the peer.
	// A valid value is less than 4MiB.
	// If zero or invalid, a default value is used.
	MaxDecoderHeaderTableSize int

	// MaxEncoderHeaderTableSize optionally specifies an upper limit for the
	// header compression table used for sending headers to the peer.
	// A valid value is less than 4MiB.
	// If zero or invalid, a default value is used.
	MaxEncoderHeaderTableSize int

	// MaxReadFrameSize optionally specifies the largest frame
	// this endpoint is willing to read.
	// A valid value is between 16KiB and 16MiB, inclusive.
	// If zero or invalid, a default value is used.
	MaxReadFrameSize int

	// MaxReceiveBufferPerConnection is the maximum size of the
	// flow control window for data received on a connection.
	// A valid value is at least 64KiB and less than 4MiB.
	// If invalid, a default value is used.
	MaxReceiveBufferPerConnection int

	// MaxReceiveBufferPerStream is the maximum size of
	// the flow control window for data received on a stream (request).
	// A valid value is less than 4MiB.
	// If zero or invalid, a default value is used.
	MaxReceiveBufferPerStream int

	// SendPingTimeout is the timeout after which a health check using a ping
	// frame will be carried out if no frame is received on a connection.
	// If zero, no health check is performed.
	SendPingTimeout time.Duration

	// PingTimeout is the timeout after which a connection will be closed
	// if a response to a ping is not received.
	// If zero, a default of 15 seconds is used.
	PingTimeout time.Duration

	// WriteByteTimeout is the timeout after which a connection will be
	// closed if no data can be written to it. The timeout begins when data is
	// available to write, and is extended whenever any bytes are written.
	WriteByteTimeout time.Duration

	// PermitProhibitedCipherSuites, if true, permits the use of
	// cipher suites prohibited by the HTTP/2 spec.
	PermitProhibitedCipherSuites bool

	// CountError, if non-nil, is called on HTTP/2 errors.
	// It is intended to increment a metric for monitoring.
	// The errType contains only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores
	// (a-z, 0-9, _).
	CountError func(errType string)
}
    HTTP2Config defines HTTP/2 configuration parameters common to both Transport
    and Server.

type Handler interface {
	ServeHTTP(ResponseWriter, *Request)
}
    A Handler responds to an HTTP request.

    Handler.ServeHTTP should write reply headers and data to the ResponseWriter
    and then return. Returning signals that the request is finished; it is
    not valid to use the ResponseWriter or read from the Request.Body after or
    concurrently with the completion of the ServeHTTP call.

    Depending on the HTTP client software, HTTP protocol version, and any
    intermediaries between the client and the Go server, it may not be possible
    to read from the Request.Body after writing to the ResponseWriter. Cautious
    handlers should read the Request.Body first, and then reply.

    Except for reading the body, handlers should not modify the provided
    Request.

    If ServeHTTP panics, the server (the caller of ServeHTTP) assumes that the
    effect of the panic was isolated to the active request. It recovers the
    panic, logs a stack trace to the server error log, and either closes the
    network connection or sends an HTTP/2 RST_STREAM, depending on the HTTP
    protocol. To abort a handler so the client sees an interrupted response but
    the server doesn't log an error, panic with the value ErrAbortHandler.

func AllowQuerySemicolons(h Handler) Handler
    AllowQuerySemicolons returns a handler that serves requests by converting
    any unescaped semicolons in the URL query to ampersands, and invoking the
    handler h.

    This restores the pre-Go 1.17 behavior of splitting query parameters on
    both semicolons and ampersands. (See golang.org/issue/25192). Note that this
    behavior doesn't match that of many proxies, and the mismatch can lead to
    security issues.

    AllowQuerySemicolons should be invoked before Request.ParseForm is called.

func FileServer(root FileSystem) Handler
    FileServer returns a handler that serves HTTP requests with the contents of
    the file system rooted at root.

    As a special case, the returned file server redirects any request ending in
    "/index.html" to the same path, without the final "index.html".

    To use the operating system's file system implementation, use http.Dir:

        http.Handle("/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("/tmp")))

    To use an fs.FS implementation, use http.FileServerFS instead.

func FileServerFS(root fs.FS) Handler
    FileServerFS returns a handler that serves HTTP requests with the contents
    of the file system fsys. The files provided by fsys must implement
    io.Seeker.

    As a special case, the returned file server redirects any request ending in
    "/index.html" to the same path, without the final "index.html".

        http.Handle("/", http.FileServerFS(fsys))

func MaxBytesHandler(h Handler, n int64) Handler
    MaxBytesHandler returns a Handler that runs h with its ResponseWriter and
    Request.Body wrapped by a MaxBytesReader.

func NotFoundHandler() Handler
    NotFoundHandler returns a simple request handler that replies to each
    request with a “404 page not found” reply.

func RedirectHandler(url string, code int) Handler
    RedirectHandler returns a request handler that redirects each request it
    receives to the given url using the given status code.

    The provided code should be in the 3xx range and is usually
    StatusMovedPermanently, StatusFound or StatusSeeOther.

func StripPrefix(prefix string, h Handler) Handler
    StripPrefix returns a handler that serves HTTP requests by removing the
    given prefix from the request URL's Path (and RawPath if set) and invoking
    the handler h. StripPrefix handles a request for a path that doesn't begin
    with prefix by replying with an HTTP 404 not found error. The prefix must
    match exactly: if the prefix in the request contains escaped characters the
    reply is also an HTTP 404 not found error.

func TimeoutHandler(h Handler, dt time.Duration, msg string) Handler
    TimeoutHandler returns a Handler that runs h with the given time limit.

    The new Handler calls h.ServeHTTP to handle each request, but if a call
    runs for longer than its time limit, the handler responds with a 503 Service
    Unavailable error and the given message in its body. (If msg is empty,
    a suitable default message will be sent.) After such a timeout, writes by h
    to its ResponseWriter will return ErrHandlerTimeout.

    TimeoutHandler supports the Pusher interface but does not support the
    Hijacker or Flusher interfaces.

type HandlerFunc func(ResponseWriter, *Request)
    The HandlerFunc type is an adapter to allow the use of ordinary functions
    as HTTP handlers. If f is a function with the appropriate signature,
    HandlerFunc(f) is a Handler that calls f.

func (f HandlerFunc) ServeHTTP(w ResponseWriter, r *Request)
    ServeHTTP calls f(w, r).

type Header map[string][]string
    A Header represents the key-value pairs in an HTTP header.

    The keys should be in canonical form, as returned by CanonicalHeaderKey.

func (h Header) Add(key, value string)
    Add adds the key, value pair to the header. It appends to any existing
    values associated with key. The key is case insensitive; it is canonicalized
    by CanonicalHeaderKey.

func (h Header) Clone() Header
    Clone returns a copy of h or nil if h is nil.

func (h Header) Del(key string)
    Del deletes the values associated with key. The key is case insensitive;
    it is canonicalized by CanonicalHeaderKey.

func (h Header) Get(key string) string
    Get gets the first value associated with the given key. If there are no
    values associated with the key, Get returns "". It is case insensitive;
    textproto.CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey is used to canonicalize the provided key.
    Get assumes that all keys are stored in canonical form. To use non-canonical
    keys, access the map directly.

func (h Header) Set(key, value string)
    Set sets the header entries associated with key to the single element value.
    It replaces any existing values associated with key. The key is case
    insensitive; it is canonicalized by textproto.CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey.
    To use non-canonical keys, assign to the map directly.

func (h Header) Values(key string) []string
    Values returns all values associated with the given key. It is case
    insensitive; textproto.CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey is used to canonicalize
    the provided key. To use non-canonical keys, access the map directly.
    The returned slice is not a copy.

func (h Header) Write(w io.Writer) error
    Write writes a header in wire format.

func (h Header) WriteSubset(w io.Writer, exclude map[string]bool) error
    WriteSubset writes a header in wire format. If exclude is not nil,
    keys where exclude[key] == true are not written. Keys are not canonicalized
    before checking the exclude map.

type Hijacker interface {
	// Hijack lets the caller take over the connection.
	// After a call to Hijack the HTTP server library
	// will not do anything else with the connection.
	//
	// It becomes the caller's responsibility to manage
	// and close the connection.
	//
	// The returned net.Conn may have read or write deadlines
	// already set, depending on the configuration of the
	// Server. It is the caller's responsibility to set
	// or clear those deadlines as needed.
	//
	// The returned bufio.Reader may contain unprocessed buffered
	// data from the client.
	//
	// After a call to Hijack, the original Request.Body must not
	// be used. The original Request's Context remains valid and
	// is not canceled until the Request's ServeHTTP method
	// returns.
	Hijack() (net.Conn, *bufio.ReadWriter, error)
}
    The Hijacker interface is implemented by ResponseWriters that allow an HTTP
    handler to take over the connection.

    The default ResponseWriter for HTTP/1.x connections supports Hijacker,
    but HTTP/2 connections intentionally do not. ResponseWriter wrappers may
    also not support Hijacker. Handlers should always test for this ability at
    runtime.

type MaxBytesError struct {
	Limit int64
}
    MaxBytesError is returned by MaxBytesReader when its read limit is exceeded.

func (e *MaxBytesError) Error() string

type ProtocolError struct {
	ErrorString string
}
    ProtocolError represents an HTTP protocol error.

    Deprecated: Not all errors in the http package related to protocol errors
    are of type ProtocolError.

func (pe *ProtocolError) Error() string

func (pe *ProtocolError) Is(err error) bool
    Is lets http.ErrNotSupported match errors.ErrUnsupported.

type Protocols struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Protocols is a set of HTTP protocols. The zero value is an empty set of
    protocols.

    The supported protocols are:

      - HTTP1 is the HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 protocols. HTTP1 is supported on both
        unsecured TCP and secured TLS connections.

      - HTTP2 is the HTTP/2 protcol over a TLS connection.

      - UnencryptedHTTP2 is the HTTP/2 protocol over an unsecured TCP
        connection.

func (p Protocols) HTTP1() bool
    HTTP1 reports whether p includes HTTP/1.

func (p Protocols) HTTP2() bool
    HTTP2 reports whether p includes HTTP/2.

func (p *Protocols) SetHTTP1(ok bool)
    SetHTTP1 adds or removes HTTP/1 from p.

func (p *Protocols) SetHTTP2(ok bool)
    SetHTTP2 adds or removes HTTP/2 from p.

func (p *Protocols) SetUnencryptedHTTP2(ok bool)
    SetUnencryptedHTTP2 adds or removes unencrypted HTTP/2 from p.

func (p Protocols) String() string

func (p Protocols) UnencryptedHTTP2() bool
    UnencryptedHTTP2 reports whether p includes unencrypted HTTP/2.

type PushOptions struct {
	// Method specifies the HTTP method for the promised request.
	// If set, it must be "GET" or "HEAD". Empty means "GET".
	Method string

	// Header specifies additional promised request headers. This cannot
	// include HTTP/2 pseudo header fields like ":path" and ":scheme",
	// which will be added automatically.
	Header Header
}
    PushOptions describes options for Pusher.Push.

type Pusher interface {
	// Push initiates an HTTP/2 server push. This constructs a synthetic
	// request using the given target and options, serializes that request
	// into a PUSH_PROMISE frame, then dispatches that request using the
	// server's request handler. If opts is nil, default options are used.
	//
	// The target must either be an absolute path (like "/path") or an absolute
	// URL that contains a valid host and the same scheme as the parent request.
	// If the target is a path, it will inherit the scheme and host of the
	// parent request.
	//
	// The HTTP/2 spec disallows recursive pushes and cross-authority pushes.
	// Push may or may not detect these invalid pushes; however, invalid
	// pushes will be detected and canceled by conforming clients.
	//
	// Handlers that wish to push URL X should call Push before sending any
	// data that may trigger a request for URL X. This avoids a race where the
	// client issues requests for X before receiving the PUSH_PROMISE for X.
	//
	// Push will run in a separate goroutine making the order of arrival
	// non-deterministic. Any required synchronization needs to be implemented
	// by the caller.
	//
	// Push returns ErrNotSupported if the client has disabled push or if push
	// is not supported on the underlying connection.
	Push(target string, opts *PushOptions) error
}
    Pusher is the interface implemented by ResponseWriters
    that support HTTP/2 server push. For more background, see
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.2.

type Request struct {
	// Method specifies the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).
	// For client requests, an empty string means GET.
	Method string

	// URL specifies either the URI being requested (for server
	// requests) or the URL to access (for client requests).

	// most requests, fields other than Path and RawQuery will be
	// empty. (See RFC 7230, Section 5.3)
	//

	// connect to, while the Request's Host field optionally
	// specifies the Host header value to send in the HTTP
	// request.
	URL *url.URL

	//
	// For incoming requests, the Host header is promoted to the
	// Request.Host field and removed from the Header map.
	//
	// HTTP defines that header names are case-insensitive. The
	// request parser implements this by using CanonicalHeaderKey,
	// making the first character and any characters following a
	// hyphen uppercase and the rest lowercase.
	//
	// For client requests, certain headers such as Content-Length
	// and Connection are automatically written when needed and
	// values in Header may be ignored. See the documentation
	// for the Request.Write method.
	Header Header

	// Body is the request's body.

	// is responsible for calling the Close method.
	//
	// For server requests, the Request Body is always non-nil
	// but will return EOF immediately when no body is present.
	// The Server will close the request body. The ServeHTTP
	// Handler does not need to.
	//
	// Body must allow Read to be called concurrently with Close.
	// In particular, calling Close should unblock a Read waiting
	// for input.
	Body io.ReadCloser

	// GetBody defines an optional func to return a new copy of
	// Body. It is used for client requests when a redirect requires

	GetBody func() (io.ReadCloser, error)

	// ContentLength records the length of the associated content.

	// also treated as unknown.
	ContentLength int64

	// TransferEncoding lists the transfer encodings from outermost to

	TransferEncoding []string

	// Close indicates whether to close the connection after

	// Transport.DisableKeepAlives were set.
	Close bool

	// For server requests, Host specifies the host on which the
	// URL is sought. For HTTP/1 (per RFC 7230, section 5.4), this
	// is either the value of the "Host" header or the host name

	// ServeMux supports patterns registered to particular host
	// names and thus protects its registered Handlers.
	//
	// For client requests, Host optionally overrides the Host

	Form url.Values

	// PostForm contains the parsed form data from PATCH, POST
	// or PUT body parameters.
	//
	// This field is only available after ParseForm is called.
	// The HTTP client ignores PostForm and uses Body instead.
	PostForm url.Values

	// MultipartForm is the parsed multipart form, including file uploads.
	// This field is only available after ParseMultipartForm is called.
	// The HTTP client ignores MultipartForm and uses Body instead.
	MultipartForm *multipart.Form

	// Trailer specifies additional headers that are sent after the request
	// body.
	//
	// For server requests, the Trailer map initially contains only the

	// not reference Trailer. After reading from Body returns EOF, Trailer
	// can be read again and will contain non-nil values, if they were sent
	// by the client.
	//
	// For client requests, Trailer must be initialized to a map containing
	// the trailer keys to later send. The values may be nil or their final
	// values. The ContentLength must be 0 or -1, to send a chunked request.
	// After the HTTP request is sent the map values can be updated while
	// the request body is read. Once the body returns EOF, the caller must
	// not mutate Trailer.
	//
	// Few HTTP clients, servers, or proxies support HTTP trailers.
	Trailer Header

	// RemoteAddr allows HTTP servers and other software to record
	// the network address that sent the request, usually for

	RemoteAddr string

	// RequestURI is the unmodified request-target of the

	TLS *tls.ConnectionState

	// Cancel is an optional channel whose closure indicates that the client

	//
	// For server requests, this field is not applicable.

}
    A Request represents an HTTP request received by a server or to be sent by a
    client.

    The field semantics differ slightly between client and server usage.
    In addition to the notes on the fields below, see the documentation for
    Request.Write and RoundTripper.

func (r *Request) AddCookie(c *Cookie)
    AddCookie adds a cookie to the request. Per RFC 6265 section 5.4, AddCookie
    does not attach more than one Cookie header field. That means all cookies,
    if any, are written into the same line, separated by semicolon. AddCookie
    only sanitizes c's name and value, and does not sanitize a Cookie header
    already present in the request.

func (r *Request) BasicAuth() (username, password string, ok bool)
    BasicAuth returns the username and password provided in the request's
    Authorization header, if the request uses HTTP Basic Authentication. See RFC
    2617, Section 2.

func (r *Request) Clone(ctx context.Context) *Request
    Clone returns a deep copy of r with its context changed to ctx. The provided
    ctx must be non-nil.

    Clone only makes a shallow copy of the Body field.

    For an outgoing client request, the context controls the entire lifetime of
    a request and its response: obtaining a connection, sending the request,
    and reading the response headers and body.

func (r *Request) Context() context.Context
    Context returns the request's context. To change the context, use
    Request.Clone or Request.WithContext.

    The returned context is always non-nil; it defaults to the background
    context.

    For outgoing client requests, the context controls cancellation.

    For incoming server requests, the context is canceled when the client's
    connection closes, the request is canceled (with HTTP/2), or when the
    ServeHTTP method returns.

func (r *Request) Cookie(name string) (*Cookie, error)
    Cookie returns the named cookie provided in the request or ErrNoCookie if
    not found. If multiple cookies match the given name, only one cookie will be
    returned.

func (r *Request) Cookies() []*Cookie
    Cookies parses and returns the HTTP cookies sent with the request.

func (r *Request) CookiesNamed(name string) []*Cookie
    CookiesNamed parses and returns the named HTTP cookies sent with the request
    or an empty slice if none matched.

func (r *Request) FormFile(key string) (multipart.File, *multipart.FileHeader, error)
    FormFile returns the first file for the provided form key. FormFile calls
    Request.ParseMultipartForm and Request.ParseForm if necessary.

func (r *Request) FormValue(key string) string
    FormValue returns the first value for the named component of the query.
    The precedence order:
     1. application/x-www-form-urlencoded form body (POST, PUT, PATCH only)
     2. query parameters (always)
     3. multipart/form-data form body (always)

    FormValue calls Request.ParseMultipartForm and Request.ParseForm if
    necessary and ignores any errors returned by these functions. If key is not
    present, FormValue returns the empty string. To access multiple values of
    the same key, call ParseForm and then inspect Request.Form directly.

func (r *Request) MultipartReader() (*multipart.Reader, error)
    MultipartReader returns a MIME multipart reader if this is a
    multipart/form-data or a multipart/mixed POST request, else returns nil and
    an error. Use this function instead of Request.ParseMultipartForm to process
    the request body as a stream.

func (r *Request) ParseForm() error
    ParseForm populates r.Form and r.PostForm.

    For all requests, ParseForm parses the raw query from the URL and updates
    r.Form.

    For POST, PUT, and PATCH requests, it also reads the request body, parses it
    as a form and puts the results into both r.PostForm and r.Form. Request body
    parameters take precedence over URL query string values in r.Form.

    If the request Body's size has not already been limited by MaxBytesReader,
    the size is capped at 10MB.

    For other HTTP methods, or when the Content-Type is not
    application/x-www-form-urlencoded, the request Body is not read, and
    r.PostForm is initialized to a non-nil, empty value.

    Request.ParseMultipartForm calls ParseForm automatically. ParseForm is
    idempotent.

func (r *Request) ParseMultipartForm(maxMemory int64) error
    ParseMultipartForm parses a request body as multipart/form-data.
    The whole request body is parsed and up to a total of maxMemory bytes of
    its file parts are stored in memory, with the remainder stored on disk in
    temporary files. ParseMultipartForm calls Request.ParseForm if necessary.
    If ParseForm returns an error, ParseMultipartForm returns it but also
    continues parsing the request body. After one call to ParseMultipartForm,
    subsequent calls have no effect.

func (r *Request) PathValue(name string) string
    PathValue returns the value for the named path wildcard in the ServeMux
    pattern that matched the request. It returns the empty string if the request
    was not matched against a pattern or there is no such wildcard in the
    pattern.

func (r *Request) PostFormValue(key string) string
    PostFormValue returns the first value for the named component of the POST,
    PUT, or PATCH request body. URL query parameters are ignored. PostFormValue
    calls Request.ParseMultipartForm and Request.ParseForm if necessary and
    ignores any errors returned by these functions. If key is not present,
    PostFormValue returns the empty string.

func (r *Request) ProtoAtLeast(major, minor int) bool
    ProtoAtLeast reports whether the HTTP protocol used in the request is at
    least major.minor.

func (r *Request) Referer() string
    Referer returns the referring URL, if sent in the request.

    Referer is misspelled as in the request itself, a mistake from the
    earliest days of HTTP. This value can also be fetched from the Header map
    as Header["Referer"]; the benefit of making it available as a method is
    that the compiler can diagnose programs that use the alternate (correct
    English) spelling req.Referrer() but cannot diagnose programs that use
    Header["Referrer"].

func (r *Request) SetBasicAuth(username, password string)
    SetBasicAuth sets the request's Authorization header to use HTTP Basic
    Authentication with the provided username and password.

    With HTTP Basic Authentication the provided username and password are not
    encrypted. It should generally only be used in an HTTPS request.

    The username may not contain a colon. Some protocols may impose additional
    requirements on pre-escaping the username and password. For instance,
    when used with OAuth2, both arguments must be URL encoded first with
    url.QueryEscape.

func (r *Request) SetPathValue(name, value string)
    SetPathValue sets name to value, so that subsequent calls to
    r.PathValue(name) return value.

func (r *Request) UserAgent() string
    UserAgent returns the client's User-Agent, if sent in the request.

func (r *Request) WithContext(ctx context.Context) *Request
    WithContext returns a shallow copy of r with its context changed to ctx.
    The provided ctx must be non-nil.

    For outgoing client request, the context controls the entire lifetime of
    a request and its response: obtaining a connection, sending the request,
    and reading the response headers and body.

    To create a new request with a context, use NewRequestWithContext. To make a
    deep copy of a request with a new context, use Request.Clone.

func (r *Request) Write(w io.Writer) error
    Write writes an HTTP/1.1 request, which is the header and body, in wire
    format. This method consults the following fields of the request:

        Host
        URL
        Method (defaults to "GET")
        Header
        ContentLength
        TransferEncoding
        Body

    If Body is present, Content-Length is <= 0 and Request.TransferEncoding
    hasn't been set to "identity", Write adds "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" to
    the header. Body is closed after it is sent.

func (r *Request) WriteProxy(w io.Writer) error
    WriteProxy is like Request.Write but writes the request in the form expected
    by an HTTP proxy. In particular, Request.WriteProxy writes the initial
    Request-URI line of the request with an absolute URI, per section 5.3 of RFC
    7230, including the scheme and host. In either case, WriteProxy also writes
    a Host header, using either r.Host or r.URL.Host.

type Response struct {
	Status     string // e.g. "200 OK"
	StatusCode int    // e.g. 200
	Proto      string // e.g. "HTTP/1.0"
	ProtoMajor int    // e.g. 1
	ProtoMinor int    // e.g. 0

	// Header maps header keys to values. If the response had multiple
	// headers with the same key, they may be concatenated, with comma
	// delimiters.  (RFC 7230, section 3.2.2 requires that multiple headers
	// be semantically equivalent to a comma-delimited sequence.) When
	// Header values are duplicated by other fields in this struct (e.g.,
	// ContentLength, TransferEncoding, Trailer), the field values are
	// authoritative.
	//
	// Keys in the map are canonicalized (see CanonicalHeaderKey).
	Header Header

	// Body represents the response body.
	//
	// The response body is streamed on demand as the Body field
	// is read. If the network connection fails or the server
	// terminates the response, Body.Read calls return an error.
	//
	// The http Client and Transport guarantee that Body is always
	// non-nil, even on responses without a body or responses with
	// a zero-length body. It is the caller's responsibility to
	// close Body. The default HTTP client's Transport may not
	// reuse HTTP/1.x "keep-alive" TCP connections if the Body is
	// not read to completion and closed.
	//
	// The Body is automatically dechunked if the server replied
	// with a "chunked" Transfer-Encoding.
	//
	// As of Go 1.12, the Body will also implement io.Writer
	// on a successful "101 Switching Protocols" response,
	// as used by WebSockets and HTTP/2's "h2c" mode.
	Body io.ReadCloser

	// ContentLength records the length of the associated content. The
	// value -1 indicates that the length is unknown. Unless Request.Method
	// is "HEAD", values >= 0 indicate that the given number of bytes may
	// be read from Body.
	ContentLength int64

	// Contains transfer encodings from outer-most to inner-most. Value is
	// nil, means that "identity" encoding is used.
	TransferEncoding []string

	// Close records whether the header directed that the connection be
	// closed after reading Body. The value is advice for clients: neither
	// ReadResponse nor Response.Write ever closes a connection.
	Close bool

	// Uncompressed reports whether the response was sent compressed but
	// was decompressed by the http package. When true, reading from
	// Body yields the uncompressed content instead of the compressed
	// content actually set from the server, ContentLength is set to -1,
	// and the "Content-Length" and "Content-Encoding" fields are deleted
	// from the responseHeader. To get the original response from
	// the server, set Transport.DisableCompression to true.
	Uncompressed bool

	// Trailer maps trailer keys to values in the same
	// format as Header.
	//
	// The Trailer initially contains only nil values, one for
	// each key specified in the server's "Trailer" header
	// value. Those values are not added to Header.
	//
	// Trailer must not be accessed concurrently with Read calls
	// on the Body.
	//
	// After Body.Read has returned io.EOF, Trailer will contain
	// any trailer values sent by the server.
	Trailer Header

	// Request is the request that was sent to obtain this Response.
	// Request's Body is nil (having already been consumed).
	// This is only populated for Client requests.
	Request *Request

	// TLS contains information about the TLS connection on which the
	// response was received. It is nil for unencrypted responses.
	// The pointer is shared between responses and should not be
	// modified.
	TLS *tls.ConnectionState
}
    Response represents the response from an HTTP request.

    The Client and Transport return Responses from servers once the response
    headers have been received. The response body is streamed on demand as the
    Body field is read.

func (r *Response) Cookies() []*Cookie
    Cookies parses and returns the cookies set in the Set-Cookie headers.

func (r *Response) Location() (*url.URL, error)
    Location returns the URL of the response's "Location" header, if present.
    Relative redirects are resolved relative to Response.Request. ErrNoLocation
    is returned if no Location header is present.

func (r *Response) ProtoAtLeast(major, minor int) bool
    ProtoAtLeast reports whether the HTTP protocol used in the response is at
    least major.minor.

func (r *Response) Write(w io.Writer) error
    Write writes r to w in the HTTP/1.x server response format, including the
    status line, headers, body, and optional trailer.

    This method consults the following fields of the response r:

        StatusCode
        ProtoMajor
        ProtoMinor
        Request.Method
        TransferEncoding
        Trailer
        Body
        ContentLength
        Header, values for non-canonical keys will have unpredictable behavior

    The Response Body is closed after it is sent.

type ResponseController struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A ResponseController is used by an HTTP handler to control the response.

    A ResponseController may not be used after the Handler.ServeHTTP method has
    returned.

func NewResponseController(rw ResponseWriter) *ResponseController
    NewResponseController creates a ResponseController for a request.

    The ResponseWriter should be the original value passed to the
    Handler.ServeHTTP method, or have an Unwrap method returning the original
    ResponseWriter.

    If the ResponseWriter implements any of the following methods, the
    ResponseController will call them as appropriate:

        Flush()
        FlushError() error // alternative Flush returning an error
        Hijack() (net.Conn, *bufio.ReadWriter, error)
        SetReadDeadline(deadline time.Time) error
        SetWriteDeadline(deadline time.Time) error
        EnableFullDuplex() error

    If the ResponseWriter does not support a method, ResponseController returns
    an error matching ErrNotSupported.

func (c *ResponseController) EnableFullDuplex() error
    EnableFullDuplex indicates that the request handler will interleave reads
    from Request.Body with writes to the ResponseWriter.

    For HTTP/1 requests, the Go HTTP server by default consumes any unread
    portion of the request body before beginning to write the response,
    preventing handlers from concurrently reading from the request and writing
    the response. Calling EnableFullDuplex disables this behavior and permits
    handlers to continue to read from the request while concurrently writing the
    response.

    For HTTP/2 requests, the Go HTTP server always permits concurrent reads and
    responses.

func (c *ResponseController) Flush() error
    Flush flushes buffered data to the client.

func (c *ResponseController) Hijack() (net.Conn, *bufio.ReadWriter, error)
    Hijack lets the caller take over the connection. See the Hijacker interface
    for details.

func (c *ResponseController) SetReadDeadline(deadline time.Time) error
    SetReadDeadline sets the deadline for reading the entire request, including
    the body. Reads from the request body after the deadline has been exceeded
    will return an error. A zero value means no deadline.

    Setting the read deadline after it has been exceeded will not extend it.

func (c *ResponseController) SetWriteDeadline(deadline time.Time) error
    SetWriteDeadline sets the deadline for writing the response. Writes to the
    response body after the deadline has been exceeded will not block, but may
    succeed if the data has been buffered. A zero value means no deadline.

    Setting the write deadline after it has been exceeded will not extend it.

type ResponseWriter interface {
	// Header returns the header map that will be sent by
	// [ResponseWriter.WriteHeader]. The [Header] map also is the mechanism with which
	// [Handler] implementations can set HTTP trailers.
	//
	// Changing the header map after a call to [ResponseWriter.WriteHeader] (or
	// [ResponseWriter.Write]) has no effect unless the HTTP status code was of the
	// 1xx class or the modified headers are trailers.
	//
	// There are two ways to set Trailers. The preferred way is to
	// predeclare in the headers which trailers you will later
	// send by setting the "Trailer" header to the names of the
	// trailer keys which will come later. In this case, those
	// keys of the Header map are treated as if they were
	// trailers. See the example. The second way, for trailer
	// keys not known to the [Handler] until after the first [ResponseWriter.Write],
	// is to prefix the [Header] map keys with the [TrailerPrefix]
	// constant value.
	//
	// To suppress automatic response headers (such as "Date"), set
	// their value to nil.
	Header() Header

	// Write writes the data to the connection as part of an HTTP reply.
	//
	// If [ResponseWriter.WriteHeader] has not yet been called, Write calls
	// WriteHeader(http.StatusOK) before writing the data. If the Header
	// does not contain a Content-Type line, Write adds a Content-Type set
	// to the result of passing the initial 512 bytes of written data to
	// [DetectContentType]. Additionally, if the total size of all written
	// data is under a few KB and there are no Flush calls, the
	// Content-Length header is added automatically.
	//
	// Depending on the HTTP protocol version and the client, calling
	// Write or WriteHeader may prevent future reads on the
	// Request.Body. For HTTP/1.x requests, handlers should read any
	// needed request body data before writing the response. Once the
	// headers have been flushed (due to either an explicit Flusher.Flush
	// call or writing enough data to trigger a flush), the request body
	// may be unavailable. For HTTP/2 requests, the Go HTTP server permits
	// handlers to continue to read the request body while concurrently
	// writing the response. However, such behavior may not be supported
	// by all HTTP/2 clients. Handlers should read before writing if
	// possible to maximize compatibility.
	Write([]byte) (int, error)

	// WriteHeader sends an HTTP response header with the provided
	// status code.
	//
	// If WriteHeader is not called explicitly, the first call to Write
	// will trigger an implicit WriteHeader(http.StatusOK).
	// Thus explicit calls to WriteHeader are mainly used to
	// send error codes or 1xx informational responses.
	//
	// The provided code must be a valid HTTP 1xx-5xx status code.
	// Any number of 1xx headers may be written, followed by at most
	// one 2xx-5xx header. 1xx headers are sent immediately, but 2xx-5xx
	// headers may be buffered. Use the Flusher interface to send
	// buffered data. The header map is cleared when 2xx-5xx headers are
	// sent, but not with 1xx headers.
	//
	// The server will automatically send a 100 (Continue) header
	// on the first read from the request body if the request has
	// an "Expect: 100-continue" header.
	WriteHeader(statusCode int)
}
    A ResponseWriter interface is used by an HTTP handler to construct an HTTP
    response.

    A ResponseWriter may not be used after Handler.ServeHTTP has returned.

type RoundTripper interface {
	// RoundTrip executes a single HTTP transaction, returning
	// a Response for the provided Request.
	//
	// RoundTrip should not attempt to interpret the response. In
	// particular, RoundTrip must return err == nil if it obtained
	// a response, regardless of the response's HTTP status code.
	// A non-nil err should be reserved for failure to obtain a
	// response. Similarly, RoundTrip should not attempt to
	// handle higher-level protocol details such as redirects,
	// authentication, or cookies.
	//
	// RoundTrip should not modify the request, except for
	// consuming and closing the Request's Body. RoundTrip may
	// read fields of the request in a separate goroutine. Callers
	// should not mutate or reuse the request until the Response's
	// Body has been closed.
	//
	// RoundTrip must always close the body, including on errors,
	// but depending on the implementation may do so in a separate
	// goroutine even after RoundTrip returns. This means that
	// callers wanting to reuse the body for subsequent requests
	// must arrange to wait for the Close call before doing so.
	//
	// The Request's URL and Header fields must be initialized.
	RoundTrip(*Request) (*Response, error)
}
    RoundTripper is an interface representing the ability to execute a single
    HTTP transaction, obtaining the Response for a given Request.

    A RoundTripper must be safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.

var DefaultTransport RoundTripper = &Transport{
	Proxy: ProxyFromEnvironment,
	DialContext: defaultTransportDialContext(&net.Dialer{
		Timeout:   30 * time.Second,
		KeepAlive: 30 * time.Second,
	}),
	ForceAttemptHTTP2:     true,
	MaxIdleConns:          100,
	IdleConnTimeout:       90 * time.Second,
	TLSHandshakeTimeout:   10 * time.Second,
	ExpectContinueTimeout: 1 * time.Second,
}
    DefaultTransport is the default implementation of Transport and is used
    by DefaultClient. It establishes network connections as needed and caches
    them for reuse by subsequent calls. It uses HTTP proxies as directed by the
    environment variables HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY (or the lowercase
    versions thereof).

func NewFileTransport(fs FileSystem) RoundTripper
    NewFileTransport returns a new RoundTripper, serving the provided
    FileSystem. The returned RoundTripper ignores the URL host in its incoming
    requests, as well as most other properties of the request.

    The typical use case for NewFileTransport is to register the "file" protocol
    with a Transport, as in:

        t := &http.Transport{}
        t.RegisterProtocol("file", http.NewFileTransport(http.Dir("/")))
        c := &http.Client{Transport: t}
        res, err := c.Get("file:///etc/passwd")
        ...

func NewFileTransportFS(fsys fs.FS) RoundTripper
    NewFileTransportFS returns a new RoundTripper, serving the provided file
    system fsys. The returned RoundTripper ignores the URL host in its incoming
    requests, as well as most other properties of the request. The files
    provided by fsys must implement io.Seeker.

    The typical use case for NewFileTransportFS is to register the "file"
    protocol with a Transport, as in:

        fsys := os.DirFS("/")
        t := &http.Transport{}
        t.RegisterProtocol("file", http.NewFileTransportFS(fsys))
        c := &http.Client{Transport: t}
        res, err := c.Get("file:///etc/passwd")
        ...

type SameSite int
    SameSite allows a server to define a cookie attribute making it impossible
    for the browser to send this cookie along with cross-site requests.
    The main goal is to mitigate the risk of cross-origin information leakage,
    and provide some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks.

    See https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-cookie-same-site-00 for
    details.

const (
	SameSiteDefaultMode SameSite = iota + 1
	SameSiteLaxMode
	SameSiteStrictMode
	SameSiteNoneMode
)
type ServeMux struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    ServeMux is an HTTP request multiplexer. It matches the URL of each incoming
    request against a list of registered patterns and calls the handler for the
    pattern that most closely matches the URL.

    # Patterns

    Patterns can match the method, host and path of a request. Some examples:

      - "/index.html" matches the path "/index.html" for any host and method.
      - "GET /static/" matches a GET request whose path begins with "/static/".
      - "example.com/" matches any request to the host "example.com".
      - "example.com/{$}" matches requests with host "example.com" and path "/".
      - "/b/{bucket}/o/{objectname...}" matches paths whose first segment is "b"
        and whose third segment is "o". The name "bucket" denotes the second
        segment and "objectname" denotes the remainder of the path.

    In general, a pattern looks like

        [METHOD ][HOST]/[PATH]

    All three parts are optional; "/" is a valid pattern. If METHOD is present,
    it must be followed by at least one space or tab.

    Literal (that is, non-wildcard) parts of a pattern match the corresponding
    parts of a request case-sensitively.

    A pattern with no method matches every method. A pattern with the method
    GET matches both GET and HEAD requests. Otherwise, the method must match
    exactly.

    A pattern with no host matches every host. A pattern with a host matches
    URLs on that host only.

    A path can include wildcard segments of the form {NAME} or {NAME...}.
    For example, "/b/{bucket}/o/{objectname...}". The wildcard name must be
    a valid Go identifier. Wildcards must be full path segments: they must be
    preceded by a slash and followed by either a slash or the end of the string.
    For example, "/b_{bucket}" is not a valid pattern.

    Normally a wildcard matches only a single path segment, ending at the next
    literal slash (not %2F) in the request URL. But if the "..." is present,
    then the wildcard matches the remainder of the URL path, including slashes.
    (Therefore it is invalid for a "..." wildcard to appear anywhere but at
    the end of a pattern.) The match for a wildcard can be obtained by calling
    Request.PathValue with the wildcard's name. A trailing slash in a path acts
    as an anonymous "..." wildcard.

    The special wildcard {$} matches only the end of the URL. For example, the
    pattern "/{$}" matches only the path "/", whereas the pattern "/" matches
    every path.

    For matching, both pattern paths and incoming request paths are unescaped
    segment by segment. So, for example, the path "/a%2Fb/100%25" is treated as
    having two segments, "a/b" and "100%". The pattern "/a%2fb/" matches it,
    but the pattern "/a/b/" does not.

    # Precedence

    If two or more patterns match a request, then the most specific pattern
    takes precedence. A pattern P1 is more specific than P2 if P1 matches a
    strict subset of P2’s requests; that is, if P2 matches all the requests
    of P1 and more. If neither is more specific, then the patterns conflict.
    There is one exception to this rule, for backwards compatibility: if two
    patterns would otherwise conflict and one has a host while the other does
    not, then the pattern with the host takes precedence. If a pattern passed to
    ServeMux.Handle or ServeMux.HandleFunc conflicts with another pattern that
    is already registered, those functions panic.

    As an example of the general rule, "/images/thumbnails/" is more specific
    than "/images/", so both can be registered. The former matches paths
    beginning with "/images/thumbnails/" and the latter will match any other
    path in the "/images/" subtree.

    As another example, consider the patterns "GET /" and "/index.html":
    both match a GET request for "/index.html", but the former pattern matches
    all other GET and HEAD requests, while the latter matches any request for
    "/index.html" that uses a different method. The patterns conflict.

    # Trailing-slash redirection

    Consider a ServeMux with a handler for a subtree, registered using a
    trailing slash or "..." wildcard. If the ServeMux receives a request for
    the subtree root without a trailing slash, it redirects the request by
    adding the trailing slash. This behavior can be overridden with a separate
    registration for the path without the trailing slash or "..." wildcard. For
    example, registering "/images/" causes ServeMux to redirect a request for
    "/images" to "/images/", unless "/images" has been registered separately.

    # Request sanitizing

    ServeMux also takes care of sanitizing the URL request path and the Host
    header, stripping the port number and redirecting any request containing .
    or .. segments or repeated slashes to an equivalent, cleaner URL. Escaped
    path elements such as "%2e" for "." and "%2f" for "/" are preserved and
    aren't considered separators for request routing.

    # Compatibility

    The pattern syntax and matching behavior of ServeMux changed significantly
    in Go 1.22. To restore the old behavior, set the GODEBUG environment
    variable to "httpmuxgo121=1". This setting is read once, at program startup;
    changes during execution will be ignored.

    The backwards-incompatible changes include:
      - Wildcards are just ordinary literal path segments in 1.21. For example,
        the pattern "/{x}" will match only that path in 1.21, but will match any
        one-segment path in 1.22.
      - In 1.21, no pattern was rejected, unless it was empty or conflicted with
        an existing pattern. In 1.22, syntactically invalid patterns will cause
        ServeMux.Handle and ServeMux.HandleFunc to panic. For example, in 1.21,
        the patterns "/{" and "/a{x}" match themselves, but in 1.22 they are
        invalid and will cause a panic when registered.
      - In 1.22, each segment of a pattern is unescaped; this was not done in
        1.21. For example, in 1.22 the pattern "/%61" matches the path "/a"
        ("%61" being the URL escape sequence for "a"), but in 1.21 it would
        match only the path "/%2561" (where "%25" is the escape for the percent
        sign).
      - When matching patterns to paths, in 1.22 each segment of the path is
        unescaped; in 1.21, the entire path is unescaped. This change mostly
        affects how paths with %2F escapes adjacent to slashes are treated.
        See https://go.dev/issue/21955 for details.

func NewServeMux() *ServeMux
    NewServeMux allocates and returns a new ServeMux.

func (mux *ServeMux) Handle(pattern string, handler Handler)
    Handle registers the handler for the given pattern. If the given pattern
    conflicts with one that is already registered or if the pattern is invalid,
    Handle panics.

    See ServeMux for details on valid patterns and conflict rules.

func (mux *ServeMux) HandleFunc(pattern string, handler func(ResponseWriter, *Request))
    HandleFunc registers the handler function for the given pattern. If the
    given pattern conflicts with one that is already registered or if the
    pattern is invalid, HandleFunc panics.

    See ServeMux for details on valid patterns and conflict rules.

func (mux *ServeMux) Handler(r *Request) (h Handler, pattern string)
    Handler returns the handler to use for the given request, consulting
    r.Method, r.Host, and r.URL.Path. It always returns a non-nil handler.
    If the path is not in its canonical form, the handler will be an
    internally-generated handler that redirects to the canonical path. If the
    host contains a port, it is ignored when matching handlers.

    The path and host are used unchanged for CONNECT requests.

    Handler also returns the registered pattern that matches the request or,
    in the case of internally-generated redirects, the path that will match
    after following the redirect.

    If there is no registered handler that applies to the request, Handler
    returns a “page not found” or “method not supported” handler and an empty
    pattern.

    Handler does not modify its argument. In particular, it does not populate
    named path wildcards, so r.PathValue will always return the empty string.

func (mux *ServeMux) ServeHTTP(w ResponseWriter, r *Request)
    ServeHTTP dispatches the request to the handler whose pattern most closely
    matches the request URL.

type Server struct {
	// Addr optionally specifies the TCP address for the server to listen on,

	ErrorLog *log.Logger

	// BaseContext optionally specifies a function that returns
	// the base context for incoming requests on this server.
	// The provided Listener is the specific Listener that's
	// about to start accepting requests.
	// If BaseContext is nil, the default is context.Background().

    A Server defines parameters for running an HTTP server. The zero value for
    Server is a valid configuration.

func (s *Server) Close() error
    Close immediately closes all active net.Listeners and any connections
    in state StateNew, StateActive, or StateIdle. For a graceful shutdown,
    use Server.Shutdown.

    Close does not attempt to close (and does not even know about) any hijacked
    connections, such as WebSockets.

    Close returns any error returned from closing the Server's underlying
    Listener(s).

func (s *Server) ListenAndServe() error
    ListenAndServe listens on the TCP network address s.Addr and then calls
    Serve to handle requests on incoming connections. Accepted connections are
    configured to enable TCP keep-alives.

    If s.Addr is blank, ":http" is used.

    ListenAndServe always returns a non-nil error. After Server.Shutdown or
    Server.Close, the returned error is ErrServerClosed.

func (s *Server) ListenAndServeTLS(certFile, keyFile string) error
    ListenAndServeTLS listens on the TCP network address s.Addr and then
    calls ServeTLS to handle requests on incoming TLS connections. Accepted
    connections are configured to enable TCP keep-alives.

    Filenames containing a certificate and matching private key for the
    server must be provided if neither the Server's TLSConfig.Certificates nor
    TLSConfig.GetCertificate are populated. If the certificate is signed by
    a certificate authority, the certFile should be the concatenation of the
    server's certificate, any intermediates, and the CA's certificate.

    If s.Addr is blank, ":https" is used.

    ListenAndServeTLS always returns a non-nil error. After Server.Shutdown or
    Server.Close, the returned error is ErrServerClosed.

func (s *Server) RegisterOnShutdown(f func())
    RegisterOnShutdown registers a function to call on Server.Shutdown.
    This can be used to gracefully shutdown connections that have undergone
    ALPN protocol upgrade or that have been hijacked. This function should start
    protocol-specific graceful shutdown, but should not wait for shutdown to
    complete.

func (s *Server) Serve(l net.Listener) error
    Serve accepts incoming connections on the Listener l, creating a new service
    goroutine for each. The service goroutines read requests and then call
    s.Handler to reply to them.

    HTTP/2 support is only enabled if the Listener returns *tls.Conn connections
    and they were configured with "h2" in the TLS Config.NextProtos.

    Serve always returns a non-nil error and closes l. After Server.Shutdown or
    Server.Close, the returned error is ErrServerClosed.

func (s *Server) ServeTLS(l net.Listener, certFile, keyFile string) error
    ServeTLS accepts incoming connections on the Listener l, creating a new
    service goroutine for each. The service goroutines perform TLS setup and
    then read requests, calling s.Handler to reply to them.

    Files containing a certificate and matching private key for the server
    must be provided if neither the Server's TLSConfig.Certificates,
    TLSConfig.GetCertificate nor config.GetConfigForClient are populated.
    If the certificate is signed by a certificate authority, the certFile
    should be the concatenation of the server's certificate, any intermediates,
    and the CA's certificate.

    ServeTLS always returns a non-nil error. After Server.Shutdown or
    Server.Close, the returned error is ErrServerClosed.

func (s *Server) SetKeepAlivesEnabled(v bool)
    SetKeepAlivesEnabled controls whether HTTP keep-alives are enabled.
    By default, keep-alives are always enabled. Only very resource-constrained
    environments or servers in the process of shutting down should disable them.

func (s *Server) Shutdown(ctx context.Context) error
    Shutdown gracefully shuts down the server without interrupting any active
    connections. Shutdown works by first closing all open listeners, then
    closing all idle connections, and then waiting indefinitely for connections
    to return to idle and then shut down. If the provided context expires before
    the shutdown is complete, Shutdown returns the context's error, otherwise it
    returns any error returned from closing the Server's underlying Listener(s).

    When Shutdown is called, Serve, ServeTLS, ListenAndServe, and
    ListenAndServeTLS immediately return ErrServerClosed. Make sure the program
    doesn't exit and waits instead for Shutdown to return.

    Shutdown does not attempt to close nor wait for hijacked connections
    such as WebSockets. The caller of Shutdown should separately notify such
    long-lived connections of shutdown and wait for them to close, if desired.
    See Server.RegisterOnShutdown for a way to register shutdown notification
    functions.

    Once Shutdown has been called on a server, it may not be reused; future
    calls to methods such as Serve will return ErrServerClosed.

}
    Transport is an implementation of RoundTripper that supports HTTP, HTTPS,
    and HTTP proxies (for either HTTP or HTTPS with CONNECT).

    By default, Transport caches connections for future re-use. This may
    leave many open connections when accessing many hosts. This behavior
    can be managed using Transport.CloseIdleConnections method and the
    Transport.MaxIdleConnsPerHost and Transport.DisableKeepAlives fields.

    Transports should be reused instead of created as needed. Transports are
    safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.

    A Transport is a low-level primitive for making HTTP and HTTPS requests.
    For high-level functionality, such as cookies and redirects, see Client.

    Transport uses HTTP/1.1 for HTTP URLs and either HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 for
    HTTPS URLs, depending on whether the server supports HTTP/2, and how the
    Transport is configured. The DefaultTransport supports HTTP/2. To explicitly
    enable HTTP/2 on a transport, set Transport.Protocols.

    Responses with status codes in the 1xx range are either handled
    automatically (100 expect-continue) or ignored. The one exception is HTTP
    status code 101 (Switching Protocols), which is considered a terminal status
    and returned by Transport.RoundTrip. To see the ignored 1xx responses,
    use the httptrace trace package's ClientTrace.Got1xxResponse.

    Transport only retries a request upon encountering a network error if
    the connection has already been used successfully and if the request is
    idempotent and either has no body or has its Request.GetBody defined.
    HTTP requests are considered idempotent if they have HTTP methods GET, HEAD,
    OPTIONS, or TRACE; or if their Header map contains an "Idempotency-Key" or
    "X-Idempotency-Key" entry. If the idempotency key value is a zero-length
    slice, the request is treated as idempotent but the header is not sent on
    the wire.

func (t *Transport) CancelRequest(req *Request)
    CancelRequest cancels an in-flight request by closing its connection.
    CancelRequest should only be called after Transport.RoundTrip has returned.

    Deprecated: Use Request.WithContext to create a request with a cancelable
    context instead. CancelRequest cannot cancel HTTP/2 requests. This may
    become a no-op in a future release of Go.

func (t *Transport) Clone() *Transport
    Clone returns a deep copy of t's exported fields.

func (t *Transport) CloseIdleConnections()
    CloseIdleConnections closes any connections which were previously connected
    from previous requests but are now sitting idle in a "keep-alive" state.
    It does not interrupt any connections currently in use.

func (t *Transport) NewClientConn(ctx context.Context, scheme, address string) (*ClientConn, error)
    NewClientConn creates a new client connection to the given address.

    If scheme is "http", the connection is unencrypted. If scheme is "https",
    the connection uses TLS.

    The protocol used for the new connection is determined by the scheme,
    Transport.Protocols configuration field, and protocols supported by the
    server. See Transport.Protocols for more details.

    If Transport.Proxy is set and indicates that a request sent to the given
    address should use a proxy, the new connection uses that proxy.

    NewClientConn always creates a new connection, even if the Transport has an
    existing cached connection to the given host.

    The new connection is not added to the Transport's connection cache,
    and will not be used by Transport.RoundTrip. It does not count against the
    MaxIdleConns and MaxConnsPerHost limits.

    The caller is responsible for closing the new connection.

func (t *Transport) RegisterProtocol(scheme string, rt RoundTripper)
    RegisterProtocol registers a new protocol with scheme. The Transport will
    pass requests using the given scheme to rt. It is rt's responsibility to
    simulate HTTP request semantics.

    RegisterProtocol can be used by other packages to provide implementations of
    protocol schemes like "ftp" or "file".

    If rt.RoundTrip returns ErrSkipAltProtocol, the Transport will handle the
    Transport.RoundTrip itself for that one request, as if the protocol were not
    registered.

func (t *Transport) RoundTrip(req *Request) (*Response, error)
    RoundTrip implements the RoundTripper interface.

    For higher-level HTTP client support (such as handling of cookies and
    redirects), see Get, Post, and the Client type.

    Like the RoundTripper interface, the error types returned by RoundTrip are
    unspecified.
