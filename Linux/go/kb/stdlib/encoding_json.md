Package json implements encoding and decoding of JSON as defined in RFC 7159.

Import path: encoding/json   Toolchain: go1.26.4

package json // import "encoding/json"

Package json implements encoding and decoding of JSON as defined in RFC 7159.
The mapping between JSON and Go values is described in the documentation for the
Marshal and Unmarshal functions.

See "JSON and Go" for an introduction to this package:
https://golang.org/doc/articles/json_and_go.html

# Security Considerations

The JSON standard (RFC 7159) is lax in its definition of a number of parser
behaviors. As such, many JSON parsers behave differently in various scenarios.
These differences in parsers mean that systems that use multiple independent
JSON parser implementations may parse the same JSON object in differing ways.

Systems that rely on a JSON object being parsed consistently for security
purposes should be careful to understand the behaviors of this parser, as well
as how these behaviors may cause interoperability issues with other parser
implementations.

Due to the Go Backwards Compatibility promise (https://go.dev/doc/go1compat)
there are a number of behaviors this package exhibits that may cause
interopability issues, but cannot be changed. In particular the following
parsing behaviors may cause issues:

  - If a JSON object contains duplicate keys, keys are processed in the order
    they are observed, meaning later values will replace or be merged into prior
    values, depending on the field type (in particular maps and structs will
    have values merged, while other types have values replaced).
  - When parsing a JSON object into a Go struct, keys are considered in a
    case-insensitive fashion.
  - When parsing a JSON object into a Go struct, unknown keys in the JSON object
    are ignored (unless a Decoder is used and Decoder.DisallowUnknownFields has
    been called).
  - Invalid UTF-8 bytes in JSON strings are replaced by the Unicode replacement
    character.
  - Large JSON number integers will lose precision when unmarshaled into
    floating-point types.

FUNCTIONS

func Compact(dst *bytes.Buffer, src []byte) error
    Compact appends to dst the JSON-encoded src with insignificant space
    characters elided.

func HTMLEscape(dst *bytes.Buffer, src []byte)
    HTMLEscape appends to dst the JSON-encoded src with <, >, &, U+2028 and
    U+2029 characters inside string literals changed to \u003c, \u003e, \u0026,
    \u2028, \u2029 so that the JSON will be safe to embed inside HTML <script>
    tags. For historical reasons, web browsers don't honor standard HTML
    escaping within <script> tags, so an alternative JSON encoding must be used.

func Indent(dst *bytes.Buffer, src []byte, prefix, indent string) error
    Indent appends to dst an indented form of the JSON-encoded src. Each element
    in a JSON object or array begins on a new, indented line beginning with
    prefix followed by one or more copies of indent according to the indentation
    nesting. The data appended to dst does not begin with the prefix nor any
    indentation, to make it easier to embed inside other formatted JSON data.
    Although leading space characters (space, tab, carriage return, newline) at
    the beginning of src are dropped, trailing space characters at the end of
    src are preserved and copied to dst. For example, if src has no trailing
    spaces, neither will dst; if src ends in a trailing newline, so will dst.

func Marshal(v any) ([]byte, error)
    Marshal returns the JSON encoding of v.

    Marshal traverses the value v recursively. If an encountered
    value implements Marshaler and is not a nil pointer, Marshal calls
    Marshaler.MarshalJSON to produce JSON. If no Marshaler.MarshalJSON method
    is present but the value implements encoding.TextMarshaler instead,
    Marshal calls encoding.TextMarshaler.MarshalText and encodes the result as a
    JSON string. The nil pointer exception is not strictly necessary but mimics
    a similar, necessary exception in the behavior of Unmarshaler.UnmarshalJSON.

    Otherwise, Marshal uses the following type-dependent default encodings:

    Boolean values encode as JSON booleans.

    Floating point, integer, and Number values encode as JSON numbers. NaN and
    +/-Inf values will return an UnsupportedValueError.

    String values encode as JSON strings coerced to valid UTF-8, replacing
    invalid bytes with the Unicode replacement rune. So that the JSON will
    be safe to embed inside HTML <script> tags, the string is encoded using
    HTMLEscape, which replaces "<", ">", "&", U+2028, and U+2029 are escaped to
    "\u003c","\u003e", "\u0026", "\u2028", and "\u2029". This replacement can be
    disabled when using an Encoder, by calling Encoder.SetEscapeHTML(false).

    Array and slice values encode as JSON arrays, except that []byte encodes as
    a base64-encoded string, and a nil slice encodes as the null JSON value.

    Struct values encode as JSON objects. Each exported struct field becomes
    a member of the object, using the field name as the object key, unless the
    field is omitted for one of the reasons given below.

    The encoding of each struct field can be customized by the format string
    stored under the "json" key in the struct field's tag. The format string
    gives the name of the field, possibly followed by a comma-separated list
    of options. The name may be empty in order to specify options without
    overriding the default field name.

    The "omitempty" option specifies that the field should be omitted from
    the encoding if the field has an empty value, defined as false, 0,
    a nil pointer, a nil interface value, and any array, slice, map, or string
    of length zero.

    As a special case, if the field tag is "-", the field is always omitted.
    Note that a field with name "-" can still be generated using the tag "-,".

    Examples of struct field tags and their meanings:

        // Field appears in JSON as key "myName".
        Field int `json:"myName"`

        // Field appears in JSON as key "myName" and
        // the field is omitted from the object if its value is empty,
        // as defined above.
        Field int `json:"myName,omitempty"`

        // Field appears in JSON as key "Field" (the default), but
        // the field is skipped if empty.
        // Note the leading comma.
        Field int `json:",omitempty"`

        // Field is ignored by this package.
        Field int `json:"-"`

        // Field appears in JSON as key "-".
        Field int `json:"-,"`

    The "omitzero" option specifies that the field should be omitted from the
    encoding if the field has a zero value, according to rules:

    1) If the field type has an "IsZero() bool" method, that will be used to
    determine whether the value is zero.

    2) Otherwise, the value is zero if it is the zero value for its type.

    If both "omitempty" and "omitzero" are specified, the field will be omitted
    if the value is either empty or zero (or both).

    The "string" option signals that a field is stored as JSON inside a
    JSON-encoded string. It applies only to fields of string, floating point,
    integer, or boolean types. This extra level of encoding is sometimes used
    when communicating with JavaScript programs:

        Int64String int64 `json:",string"`

    The key name will be used if it's a non-empty string consisting of only
    Unicode letters, digits, and ASCII punctuation except quotation marks,
    backslash, and comma.

    Embedded struct fields are usually marshaled as if their inner exported
    fields were fields in the outer struct, subject to the usual Go visibility
    rules amended as described in the next paragraph. An anonymous struct field
    with a name given in its JSON tag is treated as having that name, rather
    than being anonymous. An anonymous struct field of interface type is treated
    the same as having that type as its name, rather than being anonymous.

    The Go visibility rules for struct fields are amended for JSON when deciding
    which field to marshal or unmarshal. If there are multiple fields at the
    same level, and that level is the least nested (and would therefore be the
    nesting level selected by the usual Go rules), the following extra rules
    apply:

    1) Of those fields, if any are JSON-tagged, only tagged fields are
    considered, even if there are multiple untagged fields that would otherwise
    conflict.

    2) If there is exactly one field (tagged or not according to the first
    rule), that is selected.

    3) Otherwise there are multiple fields, and all are ignored; no error
    occurs.

    Handling of anonymous struct fields is new in Go 1.1. Prior to Go 1.1,
    anonymous struct fields were ignored. To force ignoring of an anonymous
    struct field in both current and earlier versions, give the field a JSON tag
    of "-".

    Map values encode as JSON objects. The map's key type must either be a
    string, an integer type, or implement encoding.TextMarshaler. The map keys
    are sorted and used as JSON object keys by applying the following rules,
    subject to the UTF-8 coercion described for string values above:
      - keys of any string type are used directly
      - keys that implement encoding.TextMarshaler are marshaled
      - integer keys are converted to strings

    Pointer values encode as the value pointed to. A nil pointer encodes as the
    null JSON value.

    Interface values encode as the value contained in the interface. A nil
    interface value encodes as the null JSON value.

    Channel, complex, and function values cannot be encoded in JSON. Attempting
    to encode such a value causes Marshal to return an UnsupportedTypeError.

    JSON cannot represent cyclic data structures and Marshal does not handle
    them. Passing cyclic structures to Marshal will result in an error.

func MarshalIndent(v any, prefix, indent string) ([]byte, error)
    MarshalIndent is like Marshal but applies Indent to format the output.
    Each JSON element in the output will begin on a new line beginning with
    prefix followed by one or more copies of indent according to the indentation
    nesting.

func Unmarshal(data []byte, v any) error
    Unmarshal parses the JSON-encoded data and stores the result in the
    value pointed to by v. If v is nil or not a pointer, Unmarshal returns an
    InvalidUnmarshalError.

    Unmarshal uses the inverse of the encodings that Marshal uses, allocating
    maps, slices, and pointers as necessary, with the following additional
    rules:

    To unmarshal JSON into a pointer, Unmarshal first handles the case of the
    JSON being the JSON literal null. In that case, Unmarshal sets the pointer
    to nil. Otherwise, Unmarshal unmarshals the JSON into the value pointed at
    by the pointer. If the pointer is nil, Unmarshal allocates a new value for
    it to point to.

    To unmarshal JSON into a value implementing Unmarshaler, Unmarshal
    calls that value's Unmarshaler.UnmarshalJSON method, including
    when the input is a JSON null. Otherwise, if the value implements
    encoding.TextUnmarshaler and the input is a JSON quoted string, Unmarshal
    calls encoding.TextUnmarshaler.UnmarshalText with the unquoted form of the
    string.

    To unmarshal JSON into a struct, Unmarshal matches incoming object keys
    to the keys used by Marshal (either the struct field name or its tag),
    ignoring case. If multiple struct fields match an object key, an exact case
    match is preferred over a case-insensitive one.

    Incoming object members are processed in the order observed. If an object
    includes duplicate keys, later duplicates will replace or be merged into
    prior values.

    To unmarshal JSON into an interface value, Unmarshal stores one of these in
    the interface value:

      - bool, for JSON booleans
      - float64, for JSON numbers
      - string, for JSON strings
      - []any, for JSON arrays
      - map[string]any, for JSON objects
      - nil for JSON null

    To unmarshal a JSON array into a slice, Unmarshal resets the slice length
    to zero and then appends each element to the slice. As a special case,
    to unmarshal an empty JSON array into a slice, Unmarshal replaces the slice
    with a new empty slice.

    To unmarshal a JSON array into a Go array, Unmarshal decodes JSON array
    elements into corresponding Go array elements. If the Go array is smaller
    than the JSON array, the additional JSON array elements are discarded.
    If the JSON array is smaller than the Go array, the additional Go array
    elements are set to zero values.

    To unmarshal a JSON object into a map, Unmarshal first establishes
    a map to use. If the map is nil, Unmarshal allocates a new map.
    Otherwise Unmarshal reuses the existing map, keeping existing entries.
    Unmarshal then stores key-value pairs from the JSON object into the map.
    The map's key type must either be any string type, an integer, or implement
    encoding.TextUnmarshaler.

    If the JSON-encoded data contain a syntax error, Unmarshal returns a
    SyntaxError.

    If a JSON value is not appropriate for a given target type, or if a JSON
    number overflows the target type, Unmarshal skips that field and completes
    the unmarshaling as best it can. If no more serious errors are encountered,
    Unmarshal returns an UnmarshalTypeError describing the earliest such error.
    In any case, it's not guaranteed that all the remaining fields following the
    problematic one will be unmarshaled into the target object.

    The JSON null value unmarshals into an interface, map, pointer, or slice
    by setting that Go value to nil. Because null is often used in JSON to mean
    “not present,” unmarshaling a JSON null into any other Go type has no effect
    on the value and produces no error.

    When unmarshaling quoted strings, invalid UTF-8 or invalid UTF-16 surrogate
    pairs are not treated as an error. Instead, they are replaced by the Unicode
    replacement character U+FFFD.

func Valid(data []byte) bool
    Valid reports whether data is a valid JSON encoding.


TYPES

type Decoder struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Decoder reads and decodes JSON values from an input stream.

func NewDecoder(r io.Reader) *Decoder
    NewDecoder returns a new decoder that reads from r.

    The decoder introduces its own buffering and may read data from r beyond the
    JSON values requested.

func (dec *Decoder) Buffered() io.Reader
    Buffered returns a reader of the data remaining in the Decoder's buffer.
    The reader is valid until the next call to Decoder.Decode.

func (dec *Decoder) Decode(v any) error
    Decode reads the next JSON-encoded value from its input and stores it in the
    value pointed to by v.

    See the documentation for Unmarshal for details about the conversion of JSON
    into a Go value.

func (dec *Decoder) DisallowUnknownFields()
    DisallowUnknownFields causes the Decoder to return an error when the
    destination is a struct and the input contains object keys which do not
    match any non-ignored, exported fields in the destination.

func (dec *Decoder) InputOffset() int64
    InputOffset returns the input stream byte offset of the current decoder
    position. The offset gives the location of the end of the most recently
    returned token and the beginning of the next token.

func (dec *Decoder) More() bool
    More reports whether there is another element in the current array or object
    being parsed.

func (dec *Decoder) Token() (Token, error)
    Token returns the next JSON token in the input stream. At the end of the
    input stream, Token returns nil, io.EOF.

    Token guarantees that the delimiters [ ] { } it returns are properly nested
    and matched: if Token encounters an unexpected delimiter in the input,
    it will return an error.

    The input stream consists of basic JSON values—bool, string, number,
    and null—along with delimiters [ ] { } of type Delim to mark the start and
    end of arrays and objects. Commas and colons are elided.

func (dec *Decoder) UseNumber()
    UseNumber causes the Decoder to unmarshal a number into an interface value
    as a Number instead of as a float64.

type Delim rune
    A Delim is a JSON array or object delimiter, one of [ ] { or }.

func (d Delim) String() string

type Encoder struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    An Encoder writes JSON values to an output stream.

func NewEncoder(w io.Writer) *Encoder
    NewEncoder returns a new encoder that writes to w.

func (enc *Encoder) Encode(v any) error
    Encode writes the JSON encoding of v to the stream, with insignificant space
    characters elided, followed by a newline character.

    See the documentation for Marshal for details about the conversion of Go
    values to JSON.

func (enc *Encoder) SetEscapeHTML(on bool)
    SetEscapeHTML specifies whether problematic HTML characters should be
    escaped inside JSON quoted strings. The default behavior is to escape &, <,
    and > to \u0026, \u003c, and \u003e to avoid certain safety problems that
    can arise when embedding JSON in HTML.

    In non-HTML settings where the escaping interferes with the readability of
    the output, SetEscapeHTML(false) disables this behavior.

func (enc *Encoder) SetIndent(prefix, indent string)
    SetIndent instructs the encoder to format each subsequent encoded value as
    if indented by the package-level function Indent(dst, src, prefix, indent).
    Calling SetIndent("", "") disables indentation.

type InvalidUTF8Error struct {
	S string // the whole string value that caused the error
}
    Before Go 1.2, an InvalidUTF8Error was returned by Marshal when attempting
    to encode a string value with invalid UTF-8 sequences. As of Go 1.2,
    Marshal instead coerces the string to valid UTF-8 by replacing invalid bytes
    with the Unicode replacement rune U+FFFD.

    Deprecated: No longer used; kept for compatibility.

func (e *InvalidUTF8Error) Error() string

type InvalidUnmarshalError struct {
	Type reflect.Type
}
    An InvalidUnmarshalError describes an invalid argument passed to Unmarshal.
    (The argument to Unmarshal must be a non-nil pointer.)

func (e *InvalidUnmarshalError) Error() string

type Marshaler interface {
	MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)
}
    Marshaler is the interface implemented by types that can marshal themselves
    into valid JSON.

type MarshalerError struct {
	Type reflect.Type
	Err  error
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A MarshalerError represents an error from calling a Marshaler.MarshalJSON or
    encoding.TextMarshaler.MarshalText method.

func (e *MarshalerError) Error() string

func (e *MarshalerError) Unwrap() error
    Unwrap returns the underlying error.

type Number string
    A Number represents a JSON number literal.

func (n Number) Float64() (float64, error)
    Float64 returns the number as a float64.

func (n Number) Int64() (int64, error)
    Int64 returns the number as an int64.

func (n Number) String() string
    String returns the literal text of the number.

type RawMessage []byte
    RawMessage is a raw encoded JSON value. It implements Marshaler and
    Unmarshaler and can be used to delay JSON decoding or precompute a JSON
    encoding.

func (m RawMessage) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)
    MarshalJSON returns m as the JSON encoding of m.

func (m *RawMessage) UnmarshalJSON(data []byte) error
    UnmarshalJSON sets *m to a copy of data.

type SyntaxError struct {
	Offset int64 // error occurred after reading Offset bytes
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A SyntaxError is a description of a JSON syntax error. Unmarshal will return
    a SyntaxError if the JSON can't be parsed.

func (e *SyntaxError) Error() string

type Token any
    A Token holds a value of one of these types:

      - Delim, for the four JSON delimiters [ ] { }
      - bool, for JSON booleans
      - float64, for JSON numbers
      - Number, for JSON numbers
      - string, for JSON string literals
      - nil, for JSON null

type UnmarshalFieldError struct {
	Key   string
	Type  reflect.Type
	Field reflect.StructField
}
    An UnmarshalFieldError describes a JSON object key that led to an unexported
    (and therefore unwritable) struct field.

    Deprecated: No longer used; kept for compatibility.

func (e *UnmarshalFieldError) Error() string

type UnmarshalTypeError struct {
	Value  string       // description of JSON value - "bool", "array", "number -5"
	Type   reflect.Type // type of Go value it could not be assigned to
	Offset int64        // error occurred after reading Offset bytes
	Struct string       // name of the struct type containing the field
	Field  string       // the full path from root node to the field, include embedded struct
}
    An UnmarshalTypeError describes a JSON value that was not appropriate for a
    value of a specific Go type.

func (e *UnmarshalTypeError) Error() string

type Unmarshaler interface {
	UnmarshalJSON([]byte) error
}
    Unmarshaler is the interface implemented by types that can unmarshal a JSON
    description of themselves. The input can be assumed to be a valid encoding
    of a JSON value. UnmarshalJSON must copy the JSON data if it wishes to
    retain the data after returning.

type UnsupportedTypeError struct {
	Type reflect.Type
}
    An UnsupportedTypeError is returned by Marshal when attempting to encode an
    unsupported value type.

func (e *UnsupportedTypeError) Error() string

type UnsupportedValueError struct {
	Value reflect.Value
	Str   string
}
    An UnsupportedValueError is returned by Marshal when attempting to encode an
    unsupported value.

func (e *UnsupportedValueError) Error() string
