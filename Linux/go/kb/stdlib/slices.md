FUNCTIONS

func All[Slice ~[]E, E any](s Slice) iter.Seq2[int, E]
    All returns an iterator over index-value pairs in the slice in the usual
    order.

func AppendSeq[Slice ~[]E, E any](s Slice, seq iter.Seq[E]) Slice
    AppendSeq appends the values from seq to the slice and returns the extended
    slice. If seq is empty, the result preserves the nilness of s.

func Backward[Slice ~[]E, E any](s Slice) iter.Seq2[int, E]
    Backward returns an iterator over index-value pairs in the slice, traversing
    it backward with descending indices.

func BinarySearch[S ~[]E, E cmp.Ordered](x S, target E) (int, bool)
    BinarySearch searches for target in a sorted slice and returns the earliest
    position where target is found, or the position where target would appear in
    the sort order; it also returns a bool saying whether the target is really
    found in the slice. The slice must be sorted in increasing order.

func BinarySearchFunc[S ~[]E, E, T any](x S, target T, cmp func(E, T) int) (int, bool)
    BinarySearchFunc works like BinarySearch, but uses a custom comparison
    function. The slice must be sorted in increasing order, where "increasing"
    is defined by cmp. cmp should return 0 if the slice element matches the
    target, a negative number if the slice element precedes the target, or a
    positive number if the slice element follows the target. cmp must implement
    the same ordering as the slice, such that if cmp(a, t) < 0 and cmp(b,
    t) >= 0, then a must precede b in the slice.

func Chunk[Slice ~[]E, E any](s Slice, n int) iter.Seq[Slice]
    Chunk returns an iterator over consecutive sub-slices of up to n elements of
    s. All but the last sub-slice will have size n. All sub-slices are clipped
    to have no capacity beyond the length. If s is empty, the sequence is empty:
    there is no empty slice in the sequence. Chunk panics if n is less than 1.

func Clip[S ~[]E, E any](s S) S
    Clip removes unused capacity from the slice, returning s[:len(s):len(s)].
    The result preserves the nilness of s.

func Clone[S ~[]E, E any](s S) S
    Clone returns a copy of the slice. The elements are copied using assignment,
    so this is a shallow clone. The result may have additional unused capacity.
    The result preserves the nilness of s.

func Collect[E any](seq iter.Seq[E]) []E
    Collect collects values from seq into a new slice and returns it. If seq is
    empty, the result is nil.

func Compact[S ~[]E, E comparable](s S) S
    Compact replaces consecutive runs of equal elements with a single copy. This
    is like the uniq command found on Unix. Compact modifies the contents of the
    slice s and returns the modified slice, which may have a smaller length.
    Compact zeroes the elements between the new length and the original length.
    The result preserves the nilness of s.

func CompactFunc[S ~[]E, E any](s S, eq func(E, E) bool) S
    CompactFunc is like Compact but uses an equality function to compare
    elements. For runs of elements that compare equal, CompactFunc keeps the
    first one. CompactFunc zeroes the elements between the new length and the
    original length. The result preserves the nilness of s.

func Compare[S ~[]E, E cmp.Ordered](s1, s2 S) int
    Compare compares the elements of s1 and s2, using cmp.Compare on each pair
    of elements. The elements are compared sequentially, starting at index 0,
    until one element is not equal to the other. The result of comparing the
    first non-matching elements is returned. If both slices are equal until one
    of them ends, the shorter slice is considered less than the longer one.
    The result is 0 if s1 == s2, -1 if s1 < s2, and +1 if s1 > s2.

func CompareFunc[S1 ~[]E1, S2 ~[]E2, E1, E2 any](s1 S1, s2 S2, cmp func(E1, E2) int) int
    CompareFunc is like Compare but uses a custom comparison function on
    each pair of elements. The result is the first non-zero result of cmp;
    if cmp always returns 0 the result is 0 if len(s1) == len(s2), -1 if len(s1)
    < len(s2), and +1 if len(s1) > len(s2).

func Concat[S ~[]E, E any](slices ...S) S
    Concat returns a new slice concatenating the passed in slices. If the
    concatenation is empty, the result is nil.

func Contains[S ~[]E, E comparable](s S, v E) bool
    Contains reports whether v is present in s.

func ContainsFunc[S ~[]E, E any](s S, f func(E) bool) bool
    ContainsFunc reports whether at least one element e of s satisfies f(e).

func Delete[S ~[]E, E any](s S, i, j int) S
    Delete removes the elements s[i:j] from s, returning the modified slice.
    Delete panics if j > len(s) or s[i:j] is not a valid slice of s. Delete
    is O(len(s)-i), so if many items must be deleted, it is better to make
    a single call deleting them all together than to delete one at a time.
    Delete zeroes the elements s[len(s)-(j-i):len(s)]. If the result is empty,
    it has the same nilness as s.

func DeleteFunc[S ~[]E, E any](s S, del func(E) bool) S
    DeleteFunc removes any elements from s for which del returns true, returning
    the modified slice. DeleteFunc zeroes the elements between the new length
    and the original length. If the result is empty, it has the same nilness as
    s.

func Equal[S ~[]E, E comparable](s1, s2 S) bool
    Equal reports whether two slices are equal: the same length and all elements
    equal. If the lengths are different, Equal returns false. Otherwise,
    the elements are compared in increasing index order, and the comparison
    stops at the first unequal pair. Empty and nil slices are considered equal.
    Floating point NaNs are not considered equal.

func EqualFunc[S1 ~[]E1, S2 ~[]E2, E1, E2 any](s1 S1, s2 S2, eq func(E1, E2) bool) bool
    EqualFunc reports whether two slices are equal using an equality function
    on each pair of elements. If the lengths are different, EqualFunc returns
    false. Otherwise, the elements are compared in increasing index order,
    and the comparison stops at the first index for which eq returns false.

func Grow[S ~[]E, E any](s S, n int) S
    Grow increases the slice's capacity, if necessary, to guarantee space for
    another n elements. After Grow(n), at least n elements can be appended
    to the slice without another allocation. If n is negative or too large to
    allocate the memory, Grow panics. The result preserves the nilness of s.

func Index[S ~[]E, E comparable](s S, v E) int
    Index returns the index of the first occurrence of v in s, or -1 if not
    present.

func IndexFunc[S ~[]E, E any](s S, f func(E) bool) int
    IndexFunc returns the first index i satisfying f(s[i]), or -1 if none do.

func Insert[S ~[]E, E any](s S, i int, v ...E) S
    Insert inserts the values v... into s at index i, returning the modified
    slice. The elements at s[i:] are shifted up to make room. In the returned
    slice r, r[i] == v[0], and, if i < len(s), r[i+len(v)] == value originally
    at s[i]. Insert panics if i > len(s). This function is O(len(s) + len(v)).
    If the result is empty, it has the same nilness as s.

func IsSorted[S ~[]E, E cmp.Ordered](x S) bool
    IsSorted reports whether x is sorted in ascending order.

func IsSortedFunc[S ~[]E, E any](x S, cmp func(a, b E) int) bool
    IsSortedFunc reports whether x is sorted in ascending order, with cmp as the
    comparison function as defined by SortFunc.

func Max[S ~[]E, E cmp.Ordered](x S) E
    Max returns the maximal value in x. It panics if x is empty. For
    floating-point E, Max propagates NaNs (any NaN value in x forces the output
    to be NaN).

func MaxFunc[S ~[]E, E any](x S, cmp func(a, b E) int) E
    MaxFunc returns the maximal value in x, using cmp to compare elements.
    It panics if x is empty. If there is more than one maximal element according
    to the cmp function, MaxFunc returns the first one.

func Min[S ~[]E, E cmp.Ordered](x S) E
    Min returns the minimal value in x. It panics if x is empty. For
    floating-point numbers, Min propagates NaNs (any NaN value in x forces the
    output to be NaN).

func MinFunc[S ~[]E, E any](x S, cmp func(a, b E) int) E
    MinFunc returns the minimal value in x, using cmp to compare elements.
    It panics if x is empty. If there is more than one minimal element according
    to the cmp function, MinFunc returns the first one.

func Repeat[S ~[]E, E any](x S, count int) S
    Repeat returns a new slice that repeats the provided slice the given number
    of times. The result has length and capacity (len(x) * count). The result is
    never nil. Repeat panics if count is negative or if the result of (len(x) *
    count) overflows.

func Replace[S ~[]E, E any](s S, i, j int, v ...E) S
    Replace replaces the elements s[i:j] by the given v, and returns the
    modified slice. Replace panics if j > len(s) or s[i:j] is not a valid slice
    of s. When len(v) < (j-i), Replace zeroes the elements between the new
    length and the original length. If the result is empty, it has the same
    nilness as s.

func Reverse[S ~[]E, E any](s S)
    Reverse reverses the elements of the slice in place.

func Sort[S ~[]E, E cmp.Ordered](x S)
    Sort sorts a slice of any ordered type in ascending order. When sorting
    floating-point numbers, NaNs are ordered before other values.

func SortFunc[S ~[]E, E any](x S, cmp func(a, b E) int)
    SortFunc sorts the slice x in ascending order as determined by the cmp
    function. This sort is not guaranteed to be stable. cmp(a, b) should return
    a negative number when a < b, a positive number when a > b and zero when a
    == b or a and b are incomparable in the sense of a strict weak ordering.

    SortFunc requires that cmp is a strict weak ordering. See
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_ordering#Strict_weak_orderings.
    The function should return 0 for incomparable items.

func SortStableFunc[S ~[]E, E any](x S, cmp func(a, b E) int)
    SortStableFunc sorts the slice x while keeping the original order of equal
    elements, using cmp to compare elements in the same way as SortFunc.

func Sorted[E cmp.Ordered](seq iter.Seq[E]) []E
    Sorted collects values from seq into a new slice, sorts the slice, and
    returns it. If seq is empty, the result is nil.

func SortedFunc[E any](seq iter.Seq[E], cmp func(E, E) int) []E
    SortedFunc collects values from seq into a new slice, sorts the slice using
    the comparison function, and returns it. If seq is empty, the result is nil.

func SortedStableFunc[E any](seq iter.Seq[E], cmp func(E, E) int) []E
    SortedStableFunc collects values from seq into a new slice. It then sorts
    the slice while keeping the original order of equal elements, using the
    comparison function to compare elements. It returns the new slice. If seq is
    empty, the result is nil.

func Values[Slice ~[]E, E any](s Slice) iter.Seq[E]
    Values returns an iterator that yields the slice elements in order.
