# reflect (Go standard library)

Package reflect implements run-time reflection, allowing a program to manipulate

Import path: reflect   Toolchain: go1.26.4

package reflect // import "reflect"

Package reflect implements run-time reflection, allowing a program to manipulate
objects with arbitrary types. The typical use is to take a value with static
type interface{} and extract its dynamic type information by calling TypeOf,
which returns a Type.

A call to ValueOf returns a Value representing the run-time data. Zero takes a
Type and returns a Value representing a zero value for that type.

CONSTANTS

const Ptr = Pointer
    Ptr is the old name for the Pointer kind.


FUNCTIONS

func Copy(dst, src Value) int
    Copy copies the contents of src into dst until either dst has been filled
    or src has been exhausted. It returns the number of elements copied. Dst and
    src each must have kind Slice or Array, and dst and src must have the same
    element type. It dst is an Array, it panics if Value.CanSet returns false.

    As a special case, src can have kind String if the element type of dst is
    kind Uint8.

func DeepEqual(x, y any) bool
    DeepEqual reports whether x and y are “deeply equal,” defined as follows.
    Two values of identical type are deeply equal if one of the following cases
    applies. Values of distinct types are never deeply equal.

    Array values are deeply equal when their corresponding elements are deeply
    equal.

    Struct values are deeply equal if their corresponding fields, both exported
    and unexported, are deeply equal.

    Func values are deeply equal if both are nil; otherwise they are not deeply
    equal.

    Interface values are deeply equal if they hold deeply equal concrete values.

    Map values are deeply equal when all of the following are true: they are
    both nil or both non-nil, they have the same length, and either they are the
    same map object or their corresponding keys (matched using Go equality) map
    to deeply equal values.

    Pointer values are deeply equal if they are equal using Go's == operator or
    if they point to deeply equal values.

    Slice values are deeply equal when all of the following are true: they are
    both nil or both non-nil, they have the same length, and either they point
    to the same initial entry of the same underlying array (that is, &x[0] ==
    &y[0]) or their corresponding elements (up to length) are deeply equal.
    Note that a non-nil empty slice and a nil slice (for example, []byte{} and
    []byte(nil)) are not deeply equal.

    Other values - numbers, bools, strings, and channels - are deeply equal if
    they are equal using Go's == operator.

    In general DeepEqual is a recursive relaxation of Go's == operator.
    However, this idea is impossible to implement without some inconsistency.
    Specifically, it is possible for a value to be unequal to itself, either
    because it is of func type (uncomparable in general) or because it is a
    floating-point NaN value (not equal to itself in floating-point comparison),
    or because it is an array, struct, or interface containing such a value.
    On the other hand, pointer values are always equal to themselves, even if
    they point at or contain such problematic values, because they compare equal
    using Go's == operator, and that is a sufficient condition to be deeply
    equal, regardless of content. DeepEqual has been defined so that the same
    short-cut applies to slices and maps: if x and y are the same slice or the
    same map, they are deeply equal regardless of content.

    As DeepEqual traverses the data values it may find a cycle. The second and
    subsequent times that DeepEqual compares two pointer values that have been
    compared before, it treats the values as equal rather than examining the
    values to which they point. This ensures that DeepEqual terminates.

func Select(cases []SelectCase) (chosen int, recv Value, recvOK bool)
    Select executes a select operation described by the list of cases. Like the
    Go select statement, it blocks until at least one of the cases can proceed,
    makes a uniform pseudo-random choice, and then executes that case.
    It returns the index of the chosen case and, if that case was a receive
    operation, the value received and a boolean indicating whether the value
    corresponds to a send on the channel (as opposed to a zero value received
    because the channel is closed). Select supports a maximum of 65536 cases.

func Swapper(slice any) func(i, j int)
    Swapper returns a function that swaps the elements in the provided slice.

    Swapper panics if the provided interface is not a slice.

func TypeAssert[T any](v Value) (T, bool)
    TypeAssert is semantically equivalent to:

        v2, ok := v.Interface().(T)


TYPES

type ChanDir int
    ChanDir represents a channel type's direction.

const (
	RecvDir ChanDir             = 1 << iota // <-chan
	SendDir                                 // chan<-
	BothDir = RecvDir | SendDir             // chan
)
func (d ChanDir) String() string

type Kind uint
    A Kind represents the specific kind of type that a Type represents. The zero
    Kind is not a valid kind.

const (
	Invalid Kind = iota
	Bool
	Int
	Int8
	Int16
	Int32
	Int64
	Uint
	Uint8
	Uint16
	Uint32
	Uint64
	Uintptr
	Float32
	Float64
	Complex64
	Complex128
	Array
	Chan
	Func
	Interface
	Map
	Pointer
	Slice
	String
	Struct
	UnsafePointer
)
func (k Kind) String() string
    String returns the name of k.

type MapIter struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A MapIter is an iterator for ranging over a map. See Value.MapRange.

func (iter *MapIter) Key() Value
    Key returns the key of iter's current map entry.

func (iter *MapIter) Next() bool
    Next advances the map iterator and reports whether there is another entry.
    It returns false when iter is exhausted; subsequent calls to MapIter.Key,
    MapIter.Value, or MapIter.Next will panic.

func (iter *MapIter) Reset(v Value)
    Reset modifies iter to iterate over v. It panics if v's Kind is not Map
    and v is not the zero Value. Reset(Value{}) causes iter to not to refer to
    any map, which may allow the previously iterated-over map to be garbage
    collected.

func (iter *MapIter) Value() Value
    Value returns the value of iter's current map entry.

type Method struct {
	// Name is the method name.
	Name string

	// PkgPath is the package path that qualifies a lower case (unexported)
	// method name. It is empty for upper case (exported) method names.
	// The combination of PkgPath and Name uniquely identifies a method
	// in a method set.
	// See https://golang.org/ref/spec#Uniqueness_of_identifiers
	PkgPath string

	Type  Type  // method type
	Func  Value // func with receiver as first argument
	Index int   // index for Type.Method
}
    Method represents a single method.

func (m Method) IsExported() bool
    IsExported reports whether the method is exported.

type SelectCase struct {
	Dir  SelectDir // direction of case
	Chan Value     // channel to use (for send or receive)
	Send Value     // value to send (for send)
}
    A SelectCase describes a single case in a select operation. The kind of case
    depends on Dir, the communication direction.

    If Dir is SelectDefault, the case represents a default case. Chan and Send
    must be zero Values.

    If Dir is SelectSend, the case represents a send operation. Normally Chan's
    underlying value must be a channel, and Send's underlying value must be
    assignable to the channel's element type. As a special case, if Chan is
    a zero Value, then the case is ignored, and the field Send will also be
    ignored and may be either zero or non-zero.

    If Dir is SelectRecv, the case represents a receive operation. Normally
    Chan's underlying value must be a channel and Send must be a zero Value.
    If Chan is a zero Value, then the case is ignored, but Send must still be
    a zero Value. When a receive operation is selected, the received Value is
    returned by Select.

type SelectDir int
    A SelectDir describes the communication direction of a select case.

const (
	SelectSend    SelectDir // case Chan <- Send
	SelectRecv              // case <-Chan:
	SelectDefault           // default
)
type SliceHeader struct {
	Data uintptr
	Len  int
	Cap  int
}
    SliceHeader is the runtime representation of a slice. It cannot be used
    safely or portably and its representation may change in a later release.
    Moreover, the Data field is not sufficient to guarantee the data it
    references will not be garbage collected, so programs must keep a separate,
    correctly typed pointer to the underlying data.

    Deprecated: Use unsafe.Slice or unsafe.SliceData instead.

type StringHeader struct {
	Data uintptr
	Len  int
}
    StringHeader is the runtime representation of a string. It cannot be used
    safely or portably and its representation may change in a later release.
    Moreover, the Data field is not sufficient to guarantee the data it
    references will not be garbage collected, so programs must keep a separate,
    correctly typed pointer to the underlying data.

    Deprecated: Use unsafe.String or unsafe.StringData instead.

type StructField struct {
	// Name is the field name.
	Name string

	// PkgPath is the package path that qualifies a lower case (unexported)
	// field name. It is empty for upper case (exported) field names.
	// See https://golang.org/ref/spec#Uniqueness_of_identifiers
	PkgPath string

	Type      Type      // field type
	Tag       StructTag // field tag string
	Offset    uintptr   // offset within struct, in bytes
	Index     []int     // index sequence for Type.FieldByIndex
	Anonymous bool      // is an embedded field
}
    A StructField describes a single field in a struct.

func VisibleFields(t Type) []StructField
    VisibleFields returns all the visible fields in t, which must be a struct
    type. A field is defined as visible if it's accessible directly with a
    FieldByName call. The returned fields include fields inside anonymous struct
    members and unexported fields. They follow the same order found in the
    struct, with anonymous fields followed immediately by their promoted fields.

    For each element e of the returned slice, the corresponding field can be
    retrieved from a value v of type t by calling v.FieldByIndex(e.Index).

func (f StructField) IsExported() bool
    IsExported reports whether the field is exported.

type StructTag string
    A StructTag is the tag string in a struct field.

    By convention, tag strings are a concatenation of optionally space-separated
    key:"value" pairs. Each key is a non-empty string consisting of non-control
    characters other than space (U+0020 ' '), quote (U+0022 '"'), and colon
    (U+003A ':'). Each value is quoted using U+0022 '"' characters and Go string
    literal syntax.

func (tag StructTag) Get(key string) string
    Get returns the value associated with key in the tag string. If there is
    no such key in the tag, Get returns the empty string. If the tag does not
    have the conventional format, the value returned by Get is unspecified.
    To determine whether a tag is explicitly set to the empty string, use
    StructTag.Lookup.

func (tag StructTag) Lookup(key string) (value string, ok bool)
    Lookup returns the value associated with key in the tag string. If the key
    is present in the tag the value (which may be empty) is returned. Otherwise
    the returned value will be the empty string. The ok return value reports
    whether the value was explicitly set in the tag string. If the tag does not
    have the conventional format, the value returned by Lookup is unspecified.

	PkgPath() string

	// Size returns the number of bytes needed to store
	// a value of the given type; it is analogous to unsafe.Sizeof.
	Size() uintptr

	// String returns a string representation of the type.

	// Has unexported methods.
}
    Type is the representation of a Go type.

    Not all methods apply to all kinds of types. Restrictions, if any,
    are noted in the documentation for each method. Use the Kind method to find
    out the kind of type before calling kind-specific methods. Calling a method
    inappropriate to the kind of type causes a run-time panic.

    Type values are comparable, such as with the == operator, so they can be
    used as map keys. Two Type values are equal if they represent identical
    types.

func ArrayOf(length int, elem Type) Type
    ArrayOf returns the array type with the given length and element type.
    For example, if t represents int, ArrayOf(5, t) represents [5]int.

    If the resulting type would be larger than the available address space,
    ArrayOf panics.

func ChanOf(dir ChanDir, t Type) Type
    ChanOf returns the channel type with the given direction and element type.
    For example, if t represents int, ChanOf(RecvDir, t) represents <-chan int.

    The gc runtime imposes a limit of 64 kB on channel element types. If t's
    size is equal to or exceeds this limit, ChanOf panics.

func FuncOf(in, out []Type, variadic bool) Type
    FuncOf returns the function type with the given argument and result types.
    For example if k represents int and e represents string, FuncOf([]Type{k},
    []Type{e}, false) represents func(int) string.

    The variadic argument controls whether the function is variadic. FuncOf
    panics if the in[len(in)-1] does not represent a slice and variadic is true.

func MapOf(key, elem Type) Type
    MapOf returns the map type with the given key and element types. For
    example, if k represents int and e represents string, MapOf(k, e) represents
    map[int]string.

    If the key type is not a valid map key type (that is, if it does not
    implement Go's == operator), MapOf panics.

func PointerTo(t Type) Type
    PointerTo returns the pointer type with element t. For example, if t
    represents type Foo, PointerTo(t) represents *Foo.

func PtrTo(t Type) Type
    PtrTo returns the pointer type with element t. For example, if t represents
    type Foo, PtrTo(t) represents *Foo.

    PtrTo is the old spelling of PointerTo. The two functions behave
    identically.

    Deprecated: Superseded by PointerTo.

func SliceOf(t Type) Type
    SliceOf returns the slice type with element type t. For example, if t
    represents int, SliceOf(t) represents []int.

func StructOf(fields []StructField) Type
    StructOf returns the struct type containing fields. The Offset and Index
    fields are ignored and computed as they would be by the compiler.

    StructOf currently does not support promoted methods of embedded fields and
    panics if passed unexported StructFields.

func TypeFor[T any]() Type
    TypeFor returns the Type that represents the type argument T.

func TypeOf(i any) Type
    TypeOf returns the reflection Type that represents the dynamic type of i.
    If i is a nil interface value, TypeOf returns nil.

type Value struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Value is the reflection interface to a Go value.

    Not all methods apply to all kinds of values. Restrictions, if any,
    are noted in the documentation for each method. Use the Kind method to find
    out the kind of value before calling kind-specific methods. Calling a method
    inappropriate to the kind of type causes a run time panic.

    The zero Value represents no value. Its Value.IsValid method returns false,
    its Kind method returns Invalid, its String method returns "<invalid
    Value>", and all other methods panic. Most functions and methods never
    return an invalid value. If one does, its documentation states the
    conditions explicitly.

    A Value can be used concurrently by multiple goroutines provided that the
    underlying Go value can be used concurrently for the equivalent direct
    operations.

    To compare two Values, compare the results of the Interface method. Using ==
    on two Values does not compare the underlying values they represent.

func Append(s Value, x ...Value) Value
    Append appends the values x to a slice s and returns the resulting slice.
    As in Go, each x's value must be assignable to the slice's element type.

func AppendSlice(s, t Value) Value
    AppendSlice appends a slice t to a slice s and returns the resulting slice.
    The slices s and t must have the same element type.

func Indirect(v Value) Value
    Indirect returns the value that v points to. If v is a nil pointer, Indirect
    returns a zero Value. If v is not a pointer, Indirect returns v.

func MakeChan(typ Type, buffer int) Value
    MakeChan creates a new channel with the specified type and buffer size.

func MakeFunc(typ Type, fn func(args []Value) (results []Value)) Value
    MakeFunc returns a new function of the given Type that wraps the function
    fn. When called, that new function does the following:

      - converts its arguments to a slice of Values.
      - runs results := fn(args).
      - returns the results as a slice of Values, one per formal result.

    The implementation fn can assume that the argument Value slice has the
    number and type of arguments given by typ. If typ describes a variadic
    function, the final Value is itself a slice representing the variadic
    arguments, as in the body of a variadic function. The result Value slice
    returned by fn must have the number and type of results given by typ.

    The Value.Call method allows the caller to invoke a typed function in terms
    of Values; in contrast, MakeFunc allows the caller to implement a typed
    function in terms of Values.

    The Examples section of the documentation includes an illustration of how to
    use MakeFunc to build a swap function for different types.

func MakeMap(typ Type) Value
    MakeMap creates a new map with the specified type.

func MakeMapWithSize(typ Type, n int) Value
    MakeMapWithSize creates a new map with the specified type and initial space
    for approximately n elements.

func MakeSlice(typ Type, len, cap int) Value
    MakeSlice creates a new zero-initialized slice value for the specified slice
    type, length, and capacity.

func New(typ Type) Value
    New returns a Value representing a pointer to a new zero value for the
    specified type. That is, the returned Value's Type is PointerTo(typ).

func NewAt(typ Type, p unsafe.Pointer) Value
    NewAt returns a Value representing a pointer to a value of the specified
    type, using p as that pointer.

func SliceAt(typ Type, p unsafe.Pointer, n int) Value
    SliceAt returns a Value representing a slice whose underlying data starts at
    p, with length and capacity equal to n.

    This is like unsafe.Slice.

func ValueOf(i any) Value
    ValueOf returns a new Value initialized to the concrete value stored in the
    interface i. ValueOf(nil) returns the zero Value.

func Zero(typ Type) Value
    Zero returns a Value representing the zero value for the specified type.
    The result is different from the zero value of the Value struct, which
    represents no value at all. For example, Zero(TypeOf(42)) returns a Value
    with Kind Int and value 0. The returned value is neither addressable nor
    settable.

func (v Value) Addr() Value
    Addr returns a pointer value representing the address of v. It panics if
    Value.CanAddr returns false. Addr is typically used to obtain a pointer to
    a struct field or slice element in order to call a method that requires a
    pointer receiver.

func (v Value) Bool() bool
    Bool returns v's underlying value. It panics if v's kind is not Bool.

func (v Value) Bytes() []byte
    Bytes returns v's underlying value. It panics if v's underlying value is not
    a slice of bytes or an addressable array of bytes.

func (v Value) Call(in []Value) []Value
    Call calls the function v with the input arguments in. For example, if
    len(in) == 3, v.Call(in) represents the Go call v(in[0], in[1], in[2]). Call
    panics if v's Kind is not Func. It returns the output results as Values. As
    in Go, each input argument must be assignable to the type of the function's
    corresponding input parameter. If v is a variadic function, Call creates
    the variadic slice parameter itself, copying in the corresponding values.
    It panics if the Value was obtained by accessing unexported struct fields.

func (v Value) CallSlice(in []Value) []Value
    CallSlice calls the variadic function v with the input arguments in,
    assigning the slice in[len(in)-1] to v's final variadic argument. For
    example, if len(in) == 3, v.CallSlice(in) represents the Go call v(in[0],
    in[1], in[2]...). CallSlice panics if v's Kind is not Func or if v is not
    variadic. It returns the output results as Values. As in Go, each input
    argument must be assignable to the type of the function's corresponding
    input parameter. It panics if the Value was obtained by accessing unexported
    struct fields.

func (v Value) CanAddr() bool
    CanAddr reports whether the value's address can be obtained with Value.Addr.
    Such values are called addressable. A value is addressable if it is an
    element of a slice, an element of an addressable array, a field of an
    addressable struct, or the result of dereferencing a pointer. If CanAddr
    returns false, calling Value.Addr will panic.

func (v Value) CanComplex() bool
    CanComplex reports whether Value.Complex can be used without panicking.

func (v Value) CanConvert(t Type) bool
    CanConvert reports whether the value v can be converted to type t.

func (v Value) CanInt() bool
    CanInt reports whether Int can be used without panicking.

func (v Value) CanInterface() bool
    CanInterface reports whether Value.Interface can be used without panicking.

func (v Value) CanSet() bool
    CanSet reports whether the value of v can be changed. A Value can be
    changed only if it is addressable and was not obtained by the use of
    unexported struct fields. If CanSet returns false, calling Value.Set or any
    type-specific setter (e.g., Value.SetBool, Value.SetInt) will panic.

func (v Value) CanUint() bool
    CanUint reports whether Value.Uint can be used without panicking.

func (v Value) Cap() int
    Cap returns v's capacity. It panics if v's Kind is not Array, Chan, Slice or
    pointer to Array.

func (v Value) Clear()
    Clear clears the contents of a map or zeros the contents of a slice.

    It panics if v's Kind is not Map or Slice.

func (v Value) Close()
    Close closes the channel v. It panics if v's Kind is not Chan or v is a
    receive-only channel.

func (v Value) Comparable() bool
    Comparable reports whether the value v is comparable. If the type of v
    is an interface, this checks the dynamic type. If this reports true then
    v.Interface() == x will not panic for any x, nor will v.Equal(u) for any
    Value u.

func (v Value) Complex() complex128
    Complex returns v's underlying value, as a complex128. It panics if v's Kind
    is not Complex64 or Complex128

func (v Value) Convert(t Type) Value
    Convert returns the value v converted to type t. If the usual Go conversion
    rules do not allow conversion of the value v to type t, or if converting v
    to type t panics, Convert panics.

func (v Value) Elem() Value
    Elem returns the value that the interface v contains or that the pointer v
    points to. It panics if v's Kind is not Interface or Pointer. It returns the
    zero Value if v is nil.

func (v Value) Equal(u Value) bool
    Equal reports true if v is equal to u. For two invalid values, Equal will
    report true. For an interface value, Equal will compare the value within the
    interface. Otherwise, If the values have different types, Equal will report
    false. Otherwise, for arrays and structs Equal will compare each element
    in order, and report false if it finds non-equal elements. During all
    comparisons, if values of the same type are compared, and the type is not
    comparable, Equal will panic.

func (v Value) Field(i int) Value
    Field returns the i'th field of the struct v. It panics if v's Kind is not
    Struct or i is out of range.

func (v Value) FieldByIndex(index []int) Value
    FieldByIndex returns the nested field corresponding to index. It panics if
    evaluation requires stepping through a nil pointer or a field that is not a
    struct.

func (v Value) FieldByIndexErr(index []int) (Value, error)
    FieldByIndexErr returns the nested field corresponding to index. It returns
    an error if evaluation requires stepping through a nil pointer, but panics
    if it must step through a field that is not a struct.

func (v Value) FieldByName(name string) Value
    FieldByName returns the struct field with the given name. It returns the
    zero Value if no field was found. It panics if v's Kind is not Struct.

func (v Value) FieldByNameFunc(match func(string) bool) Value
    FieldByNameFunc returns the struct field with a name that satisfies the
    match function. It panics if v's Kind is not Struct. It returns the zero
    Value if no field was found.

func (v Value) Fields() iter.Seq2[StructField, Value]
    Fields returns an iterator over each StructField of v along with its Value.

    The sequence is equivalent to calling Value.Field successively for each
    index i in the range [0, NumField()).

    It panics if v's Kind is not Struct.

func (v Value) Float() float64
    Float returns v's underlying value, as a float64. It panics if v's Kind is
    not Float32 or Float64

func (v Value) Grow(n int)
    Grow increases the slice's capacity, if necessary, to guarantee space for
    another n elements. After Grow(n), at least n elements can be appended to
    the slice without another allocation.

    It panics if v's Kind is not a Slice, or if n is negative or too large to
    allocate the memory, or if Value.CanSet returns false.

func (v Value) Index(i int) Value
    Index returns v's i'th element. It panics if v's Kind is not Array, Slice,
    or String or i is out of range.

func (v Value) Int() int64
    Int returns v's underlying value, as an int64. It panics if v's Kind is not
    Int, Int8, Int16, Int32, or Int64.

func (v Value) Interface() (i any)
    Interface returns v's current value as an interface{}. It is equivalent to:

        var i interface{} = (v's underlying value)

    It panics if the Value was obtained by accessing unexported struct fields.

func (v Value) InterfaceData() [2]uintptr
    InterfaceData returns a pair of unspecified uintptr values. It panics if v's
    Kind is not Interface.

    In earlier versions of Go, this function returned the interface's value as a
    uintptr pair. As of Go 1.4, the implementation of interface values precludes
    any defined use of InterfaceData.

    Deprecated: The memory representation of interface values is not compatible
    with InterfaceData.

func (v Value) IsNil() bool
    IsNil reports whether its argument v is nil. The argument must be a chan,
    func, interface, map, pointer, or slice value; if it is not, IsNil panics.
    Note that IsNil is not always equivalent to a regular comparison with nil in
    Go. For example, if v was created by calling ValueOf with an uninitialized
    interface variable i, i==nil will be true but v.IsNil will panic as v will
    be the zero Value.

func (v Value) IsValid() bool
    IsValid reports whether v represents a value. It returns false if v is
    the zero Value. If Value.IsValid returns false, all other methods except
    String panic. Most functions and methods never return an invalid Value.
    If one does, its documentation states the conditions explicitly.

func (v Value) IsZero() bool
    IsZero reports whether v is the zero value for its type. It panics if the
    argument is invalid.

func (v Value) Kind() Kind
    Kind returns v's Kind. If v is the zero Value (Value.IsValid returns false),
    Kind returns Invalid.

func (v Value) Len() int
    Len returns v's length. It panics if v's Kind is not Array, Chan, Map,
    Slice, String, or pointer to Array.

func (v Value) MapIndex(key Value) Value
    MapIndex returns the value associated with key in the map v. It panics
    if v's Kind is not Map. It returns the zero Value if key is not found in
    the map or if v represents a nil map. As in Go, the key's value must be
    assignable to the map's key type.

func (v Value) MapKeys() []Value
    MapKeys returns a slice containing all the keys present in the map,
    in unspecified order. It panics if v's Kind is not Map. It returns an empty
    slice if v represents a nil map.

func (v Value) MapRange() *MapIter
    MapRange returns a range iterator for a map. It panics if v's Kind is not
    Map.

    Call MapIter.Next to advance the iterator, and MapIter.Key/MapIter.Value
    to access each entry. MapIter.Next returns false when the iterator is
    exhausted. MapRange follows the same iteration semantics as a range
    statement.

    Example:

        iter := reflect.ValueOf(m).MapRange()
        for iter.Next() {
        	k := iter.Key()
        	v := iter.Value()
        	...
        }

func (v Value) Method(i int) Value
    Method returns a function value corresponding to v's i'th method. The
    arguments to a Call on the returned function should not include a receiver;
    the returned function will always use v as the receiver. Method panics if i
    is out of range or if v is a nil interface value.

    Calling this method will force the linker to retain all exported methods in
    all packages. This may make the executable binary larger but will not affect
    execution time.

func (v Value) MethodByName(name string) Value
    MethodByName returns a function value corresponding to the method of v with
    the given name. The arguments to a Call on the returned function should not
    include a receiver; the returned function will always use v as the receiver.
    It returns the zero Value if no method was found.

    Calling this method will cause the linker to retain all methods with this
    name in all packages. If the linker can't determine the name, it will retain
    all exported methods. This may make the executable binary larger but will
    not affect execution time.

func (v Value) Methods() iter.Seq2[Method, Value]
    Methods returns an iterator over each Method of v along with the
    corresponding method Value; this is a function with v bound as the receiver.
    As such, the receiver shouldn't be included in the arguments to Value.Call.

    The sequence is equivalent to calling Value.Method successively for each
    index i in the range [0, NumMethod()).

    Methods panics if v is a nil interface value.

    Calling this method will force the linker to retain all exported methods in
    all packages. This may make the executable binary larger but will not affect
    execution time.

func (v Value) NumField() int
    NumField returns the number of fields in the struct v. It panics if v's Kind
    is not Struct.

func (v Value) NumMethod() int
    NumMethod returns the number of methods in the value's method set.

    For a non-interface type, it returns the number of exported methods.

    For an interface type, it returns the number of exported and unexported
    methods.

    It panics if v's Kind is not Int, Int8, Int16, Int32, or Int64.

func (v Value) OverflowUint(x uint64) bool
    OverflowUint reports whether the uint64 x cannot be represented by v's type.
    It panics if v's Kind is not Uint, Uintptr, Uint8, Uint16, Uint32,
    or Uint64.

func (v Value) Pointer() uintptr
    Pointer returns v's value as a uintptr. It panics if v's Kind is not Chan,
    Func, Map, Pointer, Slice, String, or UnsafePointer.

    If v's Kind is Func, the returned pointer is an underlying code pointer,
    but not necessarily enough to identify a single function uniquely. The only
    guarantee is that the result is zero if and only if v is a nil func Value.

    If v's Kind is Slice, the returned pointer is to the first element of the
    slice. If the slice is nil the returned value is 0. If the slice is empty
    but non-nil the return value is non-zero.

    If v's Kind is String, the returned pointer is to the first element of the
    underlying bytes of string.

    It's preferred to use uintptr(Value.UnsafePointer()) to get the equivalent
    result.

func (v Value) Recv() (x Value, ok bool)
    Recv receives and returns a value from the channel v. It panics if v's Kind
    is not Chan. The receive blocks until a value is ready. The boolean value ok
    is true if the value x corresponds to a send on the channel, false if it is
    a zero value received because the channel is closed.

func (v Value) Send(x Value)
    Send sends x on the channel v. It panics if v's kind is not Chan or if x's
    type is not the same type as v's element type. As in Go, x's value must be
    assignable to the channel's element type.

func (v Value) Seq() iter.Seq[Value]
    Seq returns an iter.Seq[Value] that loops over the elements of v.
    If v's kind is Func, it must be a function that has no results and that
    takes a single argument of type func(T) bool for some type T. If v's kind is
    Pointer, the pointer element type must have kind Array. Otherwise v's kind
    must be Int, Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64, Uint, Uint8, Uint16, Uint32, Uint64,
    Uintptr, Array, Chan, Map, Slice, or String.

func (v Value) Seq2() iter.Seq2[Value, Value]
    Seq2 returns an iter.Seq2[Value, Value] that loops over the elements of v.
    If v's kind is Func, it must be a function that has no results and that
    takes a single argument of type func(K, V) bool for some type K, V.
    If v's kind is Pointer, the pointer element type must have kind Array.
    Otherwise v's kind must be Array, Map, Slice, or String.

func (v Value) Set(x Value)
    Set assigns x to the value v. It panics if Value.CanSet returns false.
    As in Go, x's value must be assignable to v's type and must not be derived
    from an unexported field.

func (v Value) SetBool(x bool)
    SetBool sets v's underlying value. It panics if v's Kind is not Bool or if
    Value.CanSet returns false.

    a slice of bytes or if Value.CanSet returns false.

func (v Value) SetCap(n int)
    SetCap sets v's capacity to n. It panics if v's Kind is not Slice, or if
    n is smaller than the length or greater than the capacity of the slice,
    or if Value.CanSet returns false.

func (v Value) SetComplex(x complex128)
    SetComplex sets v's underlying value to x. It panics if v's Kind is not
    Complex64 or Complex128, or if Value.CanSet returns false.

func (v Value) SetFloat(x float64)
    SetFloat sets v's underlying value to x. It panics if v's Kind is not
    Float32 or Float64, or if Value.CanSet returns false.

func (v Value) SetInt(x int64)
    SetInt sets v's underlying value to x. It panics if v's Kind is not Int,
    Int8, Int16, Int32, or Int64, or if Value.CanSet returns false.

func (v Value) SetIterKey(iter *MapIter)
    SetIterKey assigns to v the key of iter's current map entry. It is
    equivalent to v.Set(iter.Key()), but it avoids allocating a new Value.
    As in Go, the key must be assignable to v's type and must not be derived
    from an unexported field. It panics if Value.CanSet returns false.

func (v Value) SetIterValue(iter *MapIter)
    SetIterValue assigns to v the value of iter's current map entry. It is
    equivalent to v.Set(iter.Value()), but it avoids allocating a new Value.
    As in Go, the value must be assignable to v's type and must not be derived
    from an unexported field. It panics if Value.CanSet returns false.

func (v Value) SetLen(n int)
    SetLen sets v's length to n. It panics if v's Kind is not Slice, or if n
    is negative or greater than the capacity of the slice, or if Value.CanSet
    returns false.

func (v Value) SetMapIndex(key, elem Value)
    SetMapIndex sets the element associated with key in the map v to elem.
    It panics if v's Kind is not Map. If elem is the zero Value, SetMapIndex
    deletes the key from the map. Otherwise if v holds a nil map, SetMapIndex
    will panic. As in Go, key's elem must be assignable to the map's key type,
    and elem's value must be assignable to the map's elem type.

func (v Value) SetPointer(x unsafe.Pointer)
    SetPointer sets the unsafe.Pointer value v to x. It panics if v's Kind is
    not UnsafePointer or if Value.CanSet returns false.

    returns false.

func (v Value) Slice(i, j int) Value
    Slice returns v[i:j]. It panics if v's Kind is not Array, Slice or String,
    or if v is an unaddressable array, or if the indexes are out of bounds.

func (v Value) Slice3(i, j, k int) Value
    Slice3 is the 3-index form of the slice operation: it returns v[i:j:k]. It
    panics if v's Kind is not Array or Slice, or if v is an unaddressable array,
    or if the indexes are out of bounds.

func (v Value) String() string
    String returns the string v's underlying value, as a string. String is a
    special case because of Go's String method convention. Unlike the other
    getters, it does not panic if v's Kind is not String. Instead, it returns a
    string of the form "<T value>" where T is v's type. The fmt package treats
    Values specially. It does not call their String method implicitly but
    instead prints the concrete values they hold.

func (v Value) TryRecv() (x Value, ok bool)
    TryRecv attempts to receive a value from the channel v but will not block.
    It panics if v's Kind is not Chan. If the receive delivers a value, x is
    the transferred value and ok is true. If the receive cannot finish without
    blocking, x is the zero Value and ok is false. If the channel is closed,
    x is the zero value for the channel's element type and ok is false.

func (v Value) TrySend(x Value) bool
    TrySend attempts to send x on the channel v but will not block. It panics
    if v's Kind is not Chan. It reports whether the value was sent. As in Go,
    x's value must be assignable to the channel's element type.

func (v Value) Type() Type
    Type returns v's type.

func (v Value) Uint() uint64
    Uint returns v's underlying value, as a uint64. It panics if v's Kind is not
    Uint, Uintptr, Uint8, Uint16, Uint32, or Uint64.

func (v Value) UnsafeAddr() uintptr
    UnsafeAddr returns a pointer to v's data, as a uintptr. It panics if v is
    not addressable.

    It's preferred to use uintptr(Value.Addr().UnsafePointer()) to get the
    equivalent result.

func (v Value) UnsafePointer() unsafe.Pointer
    UnsafePointer returns v's value as a unsafe.Pointer. It panics if v's Kind
    is not Chan, Func, Map, Pointer, Slice, String or UnsafePointer.

    If v's Kind is Func, the returned pointer is an underlying code pointer,
    but not necessarily enough to identify a single function uniquely. The only
    guarantee is that the result is zero if and only if v is a nil func Value.

    If v's Kind is Slice, the returned pointer is to the first element of the
    slice. If the slice is nil the returned value is nil. If the slice is empty
    but non-nil the return value is non-nil.

    If v's Kind is String, the returned pointer is to the first element of the
    underlying bytes of string.

type ValueError struct {
	Method string
	Kind   Kind
}
    A ValueError occurs when a Value method is invoked on a Value that does not
    support it. Such cases are documented in the description of each method.

func (e *ValueError) Error() string


BUG: FieldByName and related functions consider struct field names to be equal
if the names are equal, even if they are unexported names originating
in different packages. The practical effect of this is that the result of
t.FieldByName("x") is not well defined if the struct type t contains
multiple fields named x (embedded from different packages).
FieldByName may return one of the fields named x or may report that there are none.
See https://golang.org/issue/4876 for more details.
