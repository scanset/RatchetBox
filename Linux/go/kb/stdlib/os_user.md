# os/user (Go standard library)

Package user allows user account lookups by name or id.

Import path: os/user   Toolchain: go1.26.4

package user // import "os/user"

Package user allows user account lookups by name or id.

For most Unix systems, this package has two internal implementations of
resolving user and group ids to names, and listing supplementary group IDs.
One is written in pure Go and parses /etc/passwd and /etc/group. The other
is cgo-based and relies on the standard C library (libc) routines such as
getpwuid_r, getgrnam_r, and getgrouplist.

When cgo is available, and the required routines are implemented in
libc for a particular platform, cgo-based (libc-backed) code is used.
This can be overridden by using osusergo build tag, which enforces the pure Go
implementation.

TYPES

type Group struct {
	Gid  string // group ID
	Name string // group name
}
    Group represents a grouping of users.

    On POSIX systems Gid contains a decimal number representing the group ID.

func LookupGroup(name string) (*Group, error)
    LookupGroup looks up a group by name. If the group cannot be found,
    the returned error is of type UnknownGroupError.

func LookupGroupId(gid string) (*Group, error)
    LookupGroupId looks up a group by groupid. If the group cannot be found,
    the returned error is of type UnknownGroupIdError.

type UnknownGroupError string
    UnknownGroupError is returned by LookupGroup when a group cannot be found.

func (e UnknownGroupError) Error() string

type UnknownGroupIdError string
    UnknownGroupIdError is returned by LookupGroupId when a group cannot be
    found.

func (e UnknownGroupIdError) Error() string

type UnknownUserError string
    UnknownUserError is returned by Lookup when a user cannot be found.

func (e UnknownUserError) Error() string

type UnknownUserIdError int
    UnknownUserIdError is returned by LookupId when a user cannot be found.

func (e UnknownUserIdError) Error() string

type User struct {
	// Uid is the user ID.
	// On POSIX systems, this is a decimal number representing the uid.
	// On Windows, this is a security identifier (SID) in a string format.
	// On Plan 9, this is the contents of /dev/user.
	Uid string
	// Gid is the primary group ID.
	// On POSIX systems, this is a decimal number representing the gid.
	// On Windows, this is a SID in a string format.
	// On Plan 9, this is the contents of /dev/user.
	Gid string
	// Username is the login name.
	Username string
	// Name is the user's real or display name.
	// It might be blank.
	// On POSIX systems, this is the first (or only) entry in the GECOS field
	// list.
	// On Windows, this is the user's display name.
	// On Plan 9, this is the contents of /dev/user.
	Name string
	// HomeDir is the path to the user's home directory (if they have one).
	HomeDir string
}
    User represents a user account.

func Current() (*User, error)
    Current returns the current user.

    The first call will cache the current user information. Subsequent calls
    will return the cached value and will not reflect changes to the current
    user.

func Lookup(username string) (*User, error)
    Lookup looks up a user by username. If the user cannot be found, the
    returned error is of type UnknownUserError.

func LookupId(uid string) (*User, error)
    LookupId looks up a user by userid. If the user cannot be found, the
    returned error is of type UnknownUserIdError.

func (u *User) GroupIds() ([]string, error)
    GroupIds returns the list of group IDs that the user is a member of.
