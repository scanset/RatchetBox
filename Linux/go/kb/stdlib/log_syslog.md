# log/syslog (Go standard library)

Package syslog provides a simple interface to the system log service. It can

Import path: log/syslog   Toolchain: go1.26.4

package syslog // import "log/syslog"

Package syslog provides a simple interface to the system log service. It can
send messages to the syslog daemon using UNIX domain sockets, UDP or TCP.

Only one call to Dial is necessary. On write failures, the syslog client will
attempt to reconnect to the server and write again.

The syslog package is frozen and is not accepting new features. Some external
packages provide more functionality. See:

    https://godoc.org/?q=syslog

FUNCTIONS

func NewLogger(p Priority, logFlag int) (*log.Logger, error)
    NewLogger creates a log.Logger whose output is written to the system log
    service with the specified priority, a combination of the syslog facility
    and severity. The logFlag argument is the flag set passed through to log.New
    to create the Logger.


TYPES

type Priority int
    The Priority is a combination of the syslog facility and severity.
    For example, LOG_ALERT | LOG_FTP sends an alert severity message from the
    FTP facility. The default severity is LOG_EMERG; the default facility is
    LOG_KERN.

const (

	// From /usr/include/sys/syslog.h.
	// These are the same on Linux, BSD, and OS X.
	LOG_EMERG Priority = iota
	LOG_ALERT
	LOG_CRIT
	LOG_ERR
	LOG_WARNING
	LOG_NOTICE
	LOG_INFO
	LOG_DEBUG
)
const (

	// From /usr/include/sys/syslog.h.
	// These are the same up to LOG_FTP on Linux, BSD, and OS X.
	LOG_KERN Priority = iota << 3
	LOG_USER
	LOG_MAIL
	LOG_DAEMON
	LOG_AUTH
	LOG_SYSLOG
	LOG_LPR
	LOG_NEWS
	LOG_UUCP
	LOG_CRON
	LOG_AUTHPRIV
	LOG_FTP

	LOG_LOCAL0
	LOG_LOCAL1
	LOG_LOCAL2
	LOG_LOCAL3
	LOG_LOCAL4
	LOG_LOCAL5
	LOG_LOCAL6
	LOG_LOCAL7
)
type Writer struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Writer is a connection to a syslog server.

func Dial(network, raddr string, priority Priority, tag string) (*Writer, error)
    Dial establishes a connection to a log daemon by connecting to address raddr
    on the specified network. Each write to the returned writer sends a log
    message with the facility and severity (from priority) and tag. If tag is
    empty, the os.Args[0] is used. If network is empty, Dial will connect to the
    local syslog server. Otherwise, see the documentation for net.Dial for valid
    values of network and raddr.

func New(priority Priority, tag string) (*Writer, error)
    New establishes a new connection to the system log daemon. Each write to the
    returned writer sends a log message with the given priority (a combination
    of the syslog facility and severity) and prefix tag. If tag is empty,
    the os.Args[0] is used.

func (w *Writer) Alert(m string) error
    Alert logs a message with severity LOG_ALERT, ignoring the severity passed
    to New.

func (w *Writer) Close() error
    Close closes a connection to the syslog daemon.

func (w *Writer) Crit(m string) error
    Crit logs a message with severity LOG_CRIT, ignoring the severity passed to
    New.

func (w *Writer) Debug(m string) error
    Debug logs a message with severity LOG_DEBUG, ignoring the severity passed
    to New.

func (w *Writer) Emerg(m string) error
    Emerg logs a message with severity LOG_EMERG, ignoring the severity passed
    to New.

func (w *Writer) Err(m string) error
    Err logs a message with severity LOG_ERR, ignoring the severity passed to
    New.

func (w *Writer) Info(m string) error
    Info logs a message with severity LOG_INFO, ignoring the severity passed to
    New.

func (w *Writer) Notice(m string) error
    Notice logs a message with severity LOG_NOTICE, ignoring the severity passed
    to New.

func (w *Writer) Warning(m string) error
    Warning logs a message with severity LOG_WARNING, ignoring the severity
    passed to New.

func (w *Writer) Write(b []byte) (int, error)
    Write sends a log message to the syslog daemon.


BUG: This package is not implemented on Windows. As the
syslog package is frozen, Windows users are encouraged to
use a package outside of the standard library. For background,
see https://golang.org/issue/1108.

BUG: This package is not implemented on Plan 9.
