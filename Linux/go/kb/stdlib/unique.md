TYPES

type Handle[T comparable] struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Handle is a globally unique identity for some value of type T.

    Two handles compare equal exactly if the two values used to create the
    handles would have also compared equal. The comparison of two handles is
    trivial and typically much more efficient than comparing the values used to
    create them.

func Make[T comparable](value T) Handle[T]
    Make returns a globally unique handle for a value of type T. Handles are
    equal if and only if the values used to produce them are equal. Make is safe
    for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.

func (h Handle[T]) Value() T
    Value returns a shallow copy of the T value that produced the Handle.
    Value is safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.
