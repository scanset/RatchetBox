# net (Go standard library)

Package net provides a portable interface for network I/O, including TCP/IP,

Import path: net   Toolchain: go1.26.4

package net // import "net"

Package net provides a portable interface for network I/O, including TCP/IP,
UDP, domain name resolution, and Unix domain sockets.

Although the package provides access to low-level networking primitives, most
clients will need only the basic interface provided by the Dial, Listen, and
Accept functions and the associated Conn and Listener interfaces. The crypto/tls
package uses the same interfaces and similar Dial and Listen functions.

The Dial function connects to a server:

    conn, err := net.Dial("tcp", "golang.org:80")
    if err != nil {
    	// handle error
    }
    fmt.Fprintf(conn, "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n")
    status, err := bufio.NewReader(conn).ReadString('\n')
    // ...

The Listen function creates servers:

    ln, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":8080")
    if err != nil {
    	// handle error
    }
    for {
    	conn, err := ln.Accept()
    	if err != nil {
    		// handle error
    	}
    	go handleConnection(conn)
    }

# Name Resolution

The method for resolving domain names, whether indirectly with functions like
Dial or directly with functions like LookupHost and LookupAddr, varies by
operating system.

On Unix systems, the resolver has two options for resolving names. It can use
a pure Go resolver that sends DNS requests directly to the servers listed in
/etc/resolv.conf, or it can use a cgo-based resolver that calls C library
routines such as getaddrinfo and getnameinfo.

On Unix the pure Go resolver is preferred over the cgo resolver, because a
blocked DNS request consumes only a goroutine, while a blocked C call consumes
an operating system thread. When cgo is available, the cgo-based resolver is
used instead under a variety of conditions: on systems that do not let programs
make direct DNS requests (OS X), when the LOCALDOMAIN environment variable
is present (even if empty), when the RES_OPTIONS or HOSTALIASES environment
variable is non-empty, when the ASR_CONFIG environment variable is non-empty
(OpenBSD only), when /etc/resolv.conf or /etc/nsswitch.conf specify the use of
features that the Go resolver does not implement.

On all systems (except Plan 9), when the cgo resolver is being used this package
applies a concurrent cgo lookup limit to prevent the system from running out of
system threads. Currently, it is limited to 500 concurrent lookups.

The resolver decision can be overridden by setting the netdns value of the
GODEBUG environment variable (see package runtime) to go or cgo, as in:

    export GODEBUG=netdns=go    # force pure Go resolver
    export GODEBUG=netdns=cgo   # force native resolver (cgo, win32)

The decision can also be forced while building the Go source tree by setting the
netgo or netcgo build tag. The netgo build tag disables entirely the use of the
native (CGO) resolver, meaning the Go resolver is the only one that can be used.
With the netcgo build tag the native and the pure Go resolver are compiled
into the binary, but the native (CGO) resolver is preferred over the Go
resolver. With netcgo, the Go resolver can still be forced at runtime with
GODEBUG=netdns=go.

A numeric netdns setting, as in GODEBUG=netdns=1, causes the resolver to print
debugging information about its decisions. To force a particular resolver while
also printing debugging information, join the two settings by a plus sign,
as in GODEBUG=netdns=go+1.

The Go resolver will send an EDNS0 additional header with a DNS request,
to signal a willingness to accept a larger DNS packet size. This can reportedly
cause sporadic failures with the DNS server run by some modems and routers.
Setting GODEBUG=netedns0=0 will disable sending the additional header.

On macOS, if Go code that uses the net package is built with
-buildmode=c-archive, linking the resulting archive into a C program requires
passing -lresolv when linking the C code.

On Plan 9, the resolver always accesses /net/cs and /net/dns.

On Windows, in Go 1.18.x and earlier, the resolver always used C library
functions, such as GetAddrInfo and DnsQuery.

    Various errors contained in OpError.

var DefaultResolver = &Resolver{}
    DefaultResolver is the resolver used by the package-level Lookup functions
    and by Dialers without a specified Resolver.

var ErrClosed error = errClosed
    ErrClosed is the error returned by an I/O call on a network connection that
    has already been closed, or that is closed by another goroutine before the
    I/O is completed. This may be wrapped in another error, and should normally
    be tested using errors.Is(err, net.ErrClosed).


FUNCTIONS

func Dial(network, address string) (Conn, error)
    Dial connects to the address on the named network.

    Known networks are "tcp", "tcp4" (IPv4-only), "tcp6" (IPv6-only), "udp",
    "udp4" (IPv4-only), "udp6" (IPv6-only), "ip", "ip4" (IPv4-only), "ip6"
    (IPv6-only), "unix", "unixgram" and "unixpacket".

    For TCP and UDP networks, the address has the form "host:port". The host
    must be a literal IP address, or a host name that can be resolved to IP
    addresses. The port must be a literal port number or a service name. If
    the host is a literal IPv6 address it must be enclosed in square brackets,
    as in "[2001:db8::1]:80" or "[fe80::1%zone]:80". The zone specifies the
    scope of the literal IPv6 address as defined in RFC 4007. The functions
    JoinHostPort and SplitHostPort manipulate a pair of host and port in this
    form. When using TCP, and the host resolves to multiple IP addresses,
    Dial will try each IP address in order until one succeeds.

    Examples:

        Dial("tcp", "golang.org:http")
        Dial("tcp", "192.0.2.1:http")
        Dial("tcp", "198.51.100.1:80")
        Dial("udp", "[2001:db8::1]:domain")
        Dial("udp", "[fe80::1%lo0]:53")
        Dial("tcp", ":80")

    For IP networks, the network must be "ip", "ip4" or "ip6" followed by a
    colon and a literal protocol number or a protocol name, and the address has
    the form "host". The host must be a literal IP address or a literal IPv6
    address with zone. It depends on each operating system how the operating
    system behaves with a non-well known protocol number such as "0" or "255".

    Examples:

        Dial("ip4:1", "192.0.2.1")
        Dial("ip6:ipv6-icmp", "2001:db8::1")
        Dial("ip6:58", "fe80::1%lo0")

    For TCP, UDP and IP networks, if the host is empty or a literal unspecified
    IP address, as in ":80", "0.0.0.0:80" or "[::]:80" for TCP and UDP, "",
    "0.0.0.0" or "::" for IP, the local system is assumed.

    For Unix networks, the address must be a file system path.

func DialIP(network string, laddr, raddr *IPAddr) (*IPConn, error)
    DialIP acts like Dial for IP networks.

    The network must be an IP network name; see func Dial for details.

    If laddr is nil, a local address is automatically chosen. If the IP field of
    raddr is nil or an unspecified IP address, the local system is assumed.

func DialTCP(network string, laddr, raddr *TCPAddr) (*TCPConn, error)
    DialTCP acts like Dial for TCP networks.

    The network must be a TCP network name; see func Dial for details.

    If laddr is nil, a local address is automatically chosen. If the IP field of
    raddr is nil or an unspecified IP address, the local system is assumed.

func DialTimeout(network, address string, timeout time.Duration) (Conn, error)
    DialTimeout acts like Dial but takes a timeout.

    The timeout includes name resolution, if required. When using TCP,
    and the host in the address parameter resolves to multiple IP addresses,
    the timeout is spread over each consecutive dial, such that each is given an
    appropriate fraction of the time to connect.

    See func Dial for a description of the network and address parameters.

func DialUDP(network string, laddr, raddr *UDPAddr) (*UDPConn, error)
    DialUDP acts like Dial for UDP networks.

    The network must be a UDP network name; see func Dial for details.

    If laddr is nil, a local address is automatically chosen. If the IP field of
    raddr is nil or an unspecified IP address, the local system is assumed.

func DialUnix(network string, laddr, raddr *UnixAddr) (*UnixConn, error)
    DialUnix acts like Dial for Unix networks.

    The network must be a Unix network name; see func Dial for details.

    If laddr is non-nil, it is used as the local address for the connection.

func FileConn(f *os.File) (c Conn, err error)
    FileConn returns a copy of the network connection corresponding to the
    open file f. It is the caller's responsibility to close f when finished.
    Closing c does not affect f, and closing f does not affect c.

func FileListener(f *os.File) (ln Listener, err error)
    FileListener returns a copy of the network listener corresponding to the
    open file f. It is the caller's responsibility to close ln when finished.
    Closing ln does not affect f, and closing f does not affect ln.

func FilePacketConn(f *os.File) (c PacketConn, err error)
    FilePacketConn returns a copy of the packet network connection corresponding
    to the open file f. It is the caller's responsibility to close f when
    finished. Closing c does not affect f, and closing f does not affect c.

func InterfaceAddrs() ([]Addr, error)
    InterfaceAddrs returns a list of the system's unicast interface addresses.

    The returned list does not identify the associated interface; use Interfaces
    and Interface.Addrs for more detail.

func InterfaceByIndex(index int) (*Interface, error)
    InterfaceByIndex returns the interface specified by index.

    On Solaris, it returns one of the logical network interfaces sharing the
    logical data link; for more precision use InterfaceByName.

func InterfaceByName(name string) (*Interface, error)
    InterfaceByName returns the interface specified by name.

func Interfaces() ([]Interface, error)
    Interfaces returns a list of the system's network interfaces.

func JoinHostPort(host, port string) string
    JoinHostPort combines host and port into a network address of the form
    "host:port". If host contains a colon, as found in literal IPv6 addresses,
    then JoinHostPort returns "[host]:port".

    See func Dial for a description of the host and port parameters.

func Listen(network, address string) (Listener, error)
    Listen announces on the local network address.

    The network must be "tcp", "tcp4", "tcp6", "unix" or "unixpacket".

    For TCP networks, if the host in the address parameter is empty or a literal
    unspecified IP address, Listen listens on all available unicast and anycast
    IP addresses of the local system. To only use IPv4, use network "tcp4". The
    address can use a host name, but this is not recommended, because it will
    create a listener for at most one of the host's IP addresses. If the port
    in the address parameter is empty or "0", as in "127.0.0.1:" or "[::1]:0",
    a port number is automatically chosen. The Addr method of Listener can be
    used to discover the chosen port.

    See func Dial for a description of the network and address parameters.

    Listen uses context.Background internally; to specify the context,
    use ListenConfig.Listen.

func ListenIP(network string, laddr *IPAddr) (*IPConn, error)
    ListenIP acts like ListenPacket for IP networks.

    The network must be an IP network name; see func Dial for details.

    If the IP field of laddr is nil or an unspecified IP address, ListenIP
    listens on all available IP addresses of the local system except multicast
    IP addresses.

func ListenMulticastUDP(network string, ifi *Interface, gaddr *UDPAddr) (*UDPConn, error)
    ListenMulticastUDP acts like ListenPacket for UDP networks but takes a group
    address on a specific network interface.

    The network must be a UDP network name; see func Dial for details.

    ListenMulticastUDP listens on all available IP addresses of the local system
    including the group, multicast IP address. If ifi is nil, ListenMulticastUDP
    uses the system-assigned multicast interface, although this is not
    recommended because the assignment depends on platforms and sometimes it
    might require routing configuration. If the Port field of gaddr is 0,
    a port number is automatically chosen.

    ListenMulticastUDP is just for convenience of simple, small applications.
    There are golang.org/x/net/ipv4 and golang.org/x/net/ipv6 packages for
    general purpose uses.

    Note that ListenMulticastUDP will set the IP_MULTICAST_LOOP socket option to
    0 under IPPROTO_IP, to disable loopback of multicast packets.

func ListenPacket(network, address string) (PacketConn, error)
    ListenPacket announces on the local network address.

    The network must be "udp", "udp4", "udp6", "unixgram", or an IP transport.
    The IP transports are "ip", "ip4", or "ip6" followed by a colon and a
    literal protocol number or a protocol name, as in "ip:1" or "ip:icmp".

    For UDP and IP networks, if the host in the address parameter is empty or
    a literal unspecified IP address, ListenPacket listens on all available IP
    addresses of the local system except multicast IP addresses. To only use
    IPv4, use network "udp4" or "ip4:proto". The address can use a host name,
    but this is not recommended, because it will create a listener for at
    most one of the host's IP addresses. If the port in the address parameter
    is empty or "0", as in "127.0.0.1:" or "[::1]:0", a port number is
    automatically chosen. The LocalAddr method of PacketConn can be used to
    discover the chosen port.

    See func Dial for a description of the network and address parameters.

    ListenPacket uses context.Background internally; to specify the context,
    use ListenConfig.ListenPacket.

func ListenTCP(network string, laddr *TCPAddr) (*TCPListener, error)
    ListenTCP acts like Listen for TCP networks.

    The network must be a TCP network name; see func Dial for details.

    If the IP field of laddr is nil or an unspecified IP address, ListenTCP
    listens on all available unicast and anycast IP addresses of the local
    system. If the Port field of laddr is 0, a port number is automatically
    chosen.

func ListenUDP(network string, laddr *UDPAddr) (*UDPConn, error)
    ListenUDP acts like ListenPacket for UDP networks.

    The network must be a UDP network name; see func Dial for details.

    If the IP field of laddr is nil or an unspecified IP address,
    ListenUDP listens on all available IP addresses of the local system except
    multicast IP addresses. If the Port field of laddr is 0, a port number is
    automatically chosen.

func ListenUnix(network string, laddr *UnixAddr) (*UnixListener, error)
    ListenUnix acts like Listen for Unix networks.

    The network must be "unix" or "unixpacket".

func ListenUnixgram(network string, laddr *UnixAddr) (*UnixConn, error)
    ListenUnixgram acts like ListenPacket for Unix networks.

    The network must be "unixgram".

func LookupAddr(addr string) (names []string, err error)
    LookupAddr performs a reverse lookup for the given address, returning a list
    of names mapping to that address.

    The returned names are validated to be properly formatted
    presentation-format domain names. If the response contains invalid names,
    those records are filtered out and an error will be returned alongside the
    remaining results, if any.

    When using the host C library resolver, at most one result will be returned.
    To bypass the host resolver, use a custom Resolver.

    LookupAddr uses context.Background internally; to specify the context,
    use Resolver.LookupAddr.

func LookupCNAME(host string) (cname string, err error)
    LookupCNAME returns the canonical name for the given host. Callers that do
    not care about the canonical name can call LookupHost or LookupIP directly;
    both take care of resolving the canonical name as part of the lookup.

    A canonical name is the final name after following zero or more CNAME
    records. LookupCNAME does not return an error if host does not contain DNS
    "CNAME" records, as long as host resolves to address records.

    The returned canonical name is validated to be a properly formatted
    presentation-format domain name.

    LookupCNAME uses context.Background internally; to specify the context,
    use Resolver.LookupCNAME.

func LookupHost(host string) (addrs []string, err error)
    LookupHost looks up the given host using the local resolver. It returns a
    slice of that host's addresses.

    LookupHost uses context.Background internally; to specify the context,
    use Resolver.LookupHost.

func LookupIP(host string) ([]IP, error)
    LookupIP looks up host using the local resolver. It returns a slice of that
    host's IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

func LookupMX(name string) ([]*MX, error)
    LookupMX returns the DNS MX records for the given domain name sorted by
    preference.

    The returned mail server names are validated to be properly formatted
    presentation-format domain names, or numeric IP addresses. If the response
    contains invalid names, those records are filtered out and an error will be
    returned alongside the remaining results, if any.

    LookupMX uses context.Background internally; to specify the context,
    use Resolver.LookupMX.

func LookupNS(name string) ([]*NS, error)
    LookupNS returns the DNS NS records for the given domain name.

    The returned name server names are validated to be properly formatted
    presentation-format domain names. If the response contains invalid names,
    those records are filtered out and an error will be returned alongside the
    remaining results, if any.

    LookupNS uses context.Background internally; to specify the context,
    use Resolver.LookupNS.

func LookupPort(network, service string) (port int, err error)
    LookupPort looks up the port for the given network and service.

    LookupPort uses context.Background internally; to specify the context,
    use Resolver.LookupPort.

func LookupSRV(service, proto, name string) (cname string, addrs []*SRV, err error)
    LookupSRV tries to resolve an SRV query of the given service, protocol,
    and domain name. The proto is "tcp" or "udp". The returned records are
    sorted by priority and randomized by weight within a priority.

    LookupSRV constructs the DNS name to look up following RFC 2782. That is,
    it looks up _service._proto.name. To accommodate services publishing SRV
    records under non-standard names, if both service and proto are empty
    strings, LookupSRV looks up name directly.

    The returned service names are validated to be properly formatted
    presentation-format domain names. If the response contains invalid names,
    those records are filtered out and an error will be returned alongside the
    remaining results, if any.

func LookupTXT(name string) ([]string, error)
    LookupTXT returns the DNS TXT records for the given domain name.

    If a DNS TXT record holds multiple strings, they are concatenated as a
    single string.

    LookupTXT uses context.Background internally; to specify the context,
    use Resolver.LookupTXT.

func ParseCIDR(s string) (IP, *IPNet, error)
    ParseCIDR parses s as a CIDR notation IP address and prefix length, like
    "192.0.2.0/24" or "2001:db8::/32", as defined in RFC 4632 and RFC 4291.

    It returns the IP address and the network implied by the IP and prefix
    length. For example, ParseCIDR("192.0.2.1/24") returns the IP address
    192.0.2.1 and the network 192.0.2.0/24.

func ParseMAC(s string) (hw HardwareAddr, err error)
    ParseMAC parses s as an IEEE 802 MAC-48, EUI-48, EUI-64, or a 20-octet IP
    over InfiniBand link-layer address using one of the following formats:

        00:00:5e:00:53:01
        02:00:5e:10:00:00:00:01
        00:00:00:00:fe:80:00:00:00:00:00:00:02:00:5e:10:00:00:00:01
        00-00-5e-00-53-01
        02-00-5e-10-00-00-00-01
        00-00-00-00-fe-80-00-00-00-00-00-00-02-00-5e-10-00-00-00-01
        0000.5e00.5301
        0200.5e10.0000.0001
        0000.0000.fe80.0000.0000.0000.0200.5e10.0000.0001
        00005e005301

func Pipe() (Conn, Conn)
    Pipe creates a synchronous, in-memory, full duplex network connection;
    both ends implement the Conn interface. Reads on one end are matched with
    writes on the other, copying data directly between the two; there is no
    internal buffering.

func ResolveIPAddr(network, address string) (*IPAddr, error)
    ResolveIPAddr returns an address of IP end point.

    The network must be an IP network name.

    If the host in the address parameter is not a literal IP address,
    ResolveIPAddr resolves the address to an address of IP end point. Otherwise,
    it parses the address as a literal IP address. The address parameter can use
    a host name, but this is not recommended, because it will return at most one
    of the host name's IP addresses.

    See func Dial for a description of the network and address parameters.

func ResolveTCPAddr(network, address string) (*TCPAddr, error)
    ResolveTCPAddr returns an address of TCP end point.

    The network must be a TCP network name.

    If the host in the address parameter is not a literal IP address or the
    port is not a literal port number, ResolveTCPAddr resolves the address to
    an address of TCP end point. Otherwise, it parses the address as a pair of
    literal IP address and port number. The address parameter can use a host
    name, but this is not recommended, because it will return at most one of the
    host name's IP addresses.

    See func Dial for a description of the network and address parameters.

func ResolveUDPAddr(network, address string) (*UDPAddr, error)
    ResolveUDPAddr returns an address of UDP end point.

    The network must be a UDP network name.

    If the host in the address parameter is not a literal IP address or the
    port is not a literal port number, ResolveUDPAddr resolves the address to
    an address of UDP end point. Otherwise, it parses the address as a pair of
    literal IP address and port number. The address parameter can use a host
    name, but this is not recommended, because it will return at most one of the
    host name's IP addresses.

    See func Dial for a description of the network and address parameters.

func ResolveUnixAddr(network, address string) (*UnixAddr, error)
    ResolveUnixAddr returns an address of Unix domain socket end point.

    The network must be a Unix network name.

    See func Dial for a description of the network and address parameters.

func SplitHostPort(hostport string) (host, port string, err error)
    SplitHostPort splits a network address of the form "host:port",
    "host%zone:port", "[host]:port" or "[host%zone]:port" into host or host%zone
    and port.

    A literal IPv6 address in hostport must be enclosed in square brackets,
    as in "[::1]:80", "[::1%lo0]:80".

    See func Dial for a description of the hostport parameter, and host and port
    results.


TYPES

type Addr interface {
	Network() string // name of the network (for example, "tcp", "udp")
	String() string  // string form of address (for example, "192.0.2.1:25", "[2001:db8::1]:80")
}
    Addr represents a network end point address.

    The two methods Addr.Network and Addr.String conventionally return strings
    that can be passed as the arguments to Dial, but the exact form and meaning
    of the strings is up to the implementation.

type AddrError struct {
	Err  string
	Addr string
}

func (e *AddrError) Error() string

func (e *AddrError) Temporary() bool

func (e *AddrError) Timeout() bool

type Buffers [][]byte
    Buffers contains zero or more runs of bytes to write.

    On certain machines, for certain types of connections, this is optimized
    into an OS-specific batch write operation (such as "writev").

func (v *Buffers) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
    Read from the buffers.

    Read implements io.Reader for Buffers.

    Read modifies the slice v as well as v[i] for 0 <= i < len(v), but does not
    modify v[i][j] for any i, j.

func (v *Buffers) WriteTo(w io.Writer) (n int64, err error)
    WriteTo writes contents of the buffers to w.

    WriteTo implements io.WriterTo for Buffers.

    WriteTo modifies the slice v as well as v[i] for 0 <= i < len(v), but does
    not modify v[i][j] for any i, j.

    DNSError represents a DNS lookup error.

func (e *DNSError) Error() string

func (e *DNSError) Temporary() bool
    Temporary reports whether the DNS error is known to be temporary. This is
    not always known; a DNS lookup may fail due to a temporary error and return
    a DNSError for which Temporary returns false.

func (e *DNSError) Timeout() bool
    Timeout reports whether the DNS lookup is known to have timed out.
    This is not always known; a DNS lookup may fail due to a timeout and return

    A Dialer contains options for connecting to an address.

    The zero value for each field is equivalent to dialing without that option.
    Dialing with the zero value of Dialer is therefore equivalent to just
    calling the Dial function.

    It is safe to call Dialer's methods concurrently.

func (d *Dialer) Dial(network, address string) (Conn, error)
    Dial connects to the address on the named network.

    See func Dial for a description of the network and address parameters.

    Dial uses context.Background internally; to specify the context, use
    Dialer.DialContext.

func (d *Dialer) DialContext(ctx context.Context, network, address string) (Conn, error)
    DialContext connects to the address on the named network using the provided
    context.

    The provided Context must be non-nil. If the context expires before the
    connection is complete, an error is returned. Once successfully connected,
    any expiration of the context will not affect the connection.

    When using TCP, and the host in the address parameter resolves to multiple
    network addresses, any dial timeout (from d.Timeout or ctx) is spread over
    each consecutive dial, such that each is given an appropriate fraction
    of the time to connect. For example, if a host has 4 IP addresses and the
    timeout is 1 minute, the connect to each single address will be given 15
    seconds to complete before trying the next one.

    See func Dial for a description of the network and address parameters.

func (d *Dialer) DialIP(ctx context.Context, network string, laddr netip.Addr, raddr netip.Addr) (*IPConn, error)
    DialIP acts like Dial for IP networks using the provided context.

    The provided Context must be non-nil. If the context expires before the
    connection is complete, an error is returned. Once successfully connected,
    any expiration of the context will not affect the connection.

    The network must be an IP network name; see func Dial for details.

func (d *Dialer) DialTCP(ctx context.Context, network string, laddr netip.AddrPort, raddr netip.AddrPort) (*TCPConn, error)
    DialTCP acts like Dial for TCP networks using the provided context.

    The provided Context must be non-nil. If the context expires before the
    connection is complete, an error is returned. Once successfully connected,
    any expiration of the context will not affect the connection.

    The network must be a TCP network name; see func Dial for details.

func (d *Dialer) DialUDP(ctx context.Context, network string, laddr netip.AddrPort, raddr netip.AddrPort) (*UDPConn, error)
    DialUDP acts like Dial for UDP networks using the provided context.

    The provided Context must be non-nil. If the context expires before the
    connection is complete, an error is returned. Once successfully connected,
    any expiration of the context will not affect the connection.

    The network must be a UDP network name; see func Dial for details.

func (d *Dialer) DialUnix(ctx context.Context, network string, laddr *UnixAddr, raddr *UnixAddr) (*UnixConn, error)
    DialUnix acts like Dial for Unix networks using the provided context.

    The provided Context must be non-nil. If the context expires before the
    connection is complete, an error is returned. Once successfully connected,
    any expiration of the context will not affect the connection.

    The network must be a Unix network name; see func Dial for details.

func (d *Dialer) MultipathTCP() bool
    MultipathTCP reports whether MPTCP will be used.

    This method doesn't check if MPTCP is supported by the operating system or
    not.

func (d *Dialer) SetMultipathTCP(use bool)
    SetMultipathTCP directs the Dial methods to use, or not use, MPTCP, if
    supported by the operating system. This method overrides the system default
    and the GODEBUG=multipathtcp=... setting if any.

    If MPTCP is not available on the host or not supported by the server,
    the Dial methods will fall back to TCP.

type Error interface {
	error
	Timeout() bool // Is the error a timeout?

	// Deprecated: Temporary errors are not well-defined.
	// Most "temporary" errors are timeouts, and the few exceptions are surprising.
	// Do not use this method.
	Temporary() bool
}
    An Error represents a network error.

    A HardwareAddr represents a physical hardware address.

func (a HardwareAddr) String() string

type IP []byte
    An IP is a single IP address, a slice of bytes. Functions in this package
    accept either 4-byte (IPv4) or 16-byte (IPv6) slices as input.

    Note that in this documentation, referring to an IP address as an IPv4
    address or an IPv6 address is a semantic property of the address, not just
    the length of the byte slice: a 16-byte slice can still be an IPv4 address.

func IPv4(a, b, c, d byte) IP
    IPv4 returns the IP address (in 16-byte form) of the IPv4 address a.b.c.d.

func ParseIP(s string) IP
    ParseIP parses s as an IP address, returning the result. The string s can be
    in IPv4 dotted decimal ("192.0.2.1"), IPv6 ("2001:db8::68"), or IPv4-mapped
    IPv6 ("::ffff:192.0.2.1") form. If s is not a valid textual representation
    of an IP address, ParseIP returns nil. The returned address is always 16
    bytes, IPv4 addresses are returned in IPv4-mapped IPv6 form.

    that same address in IPv6 form are considered to be equal.

func (ip IP) IsGlobalUnicast() bool
    IsGlobalUnicast reports whether ip is a global unicast address.

    The identification of global unicast addresses uses address type
    identification as defined in RFC 1122, RFC 4632 and RFC 4291 with the
    exception of IPv4 directed broadcast addresses. It returns true even if ip
    is in IPv4 private address space or local IPv6 unicast address space.

func (ip IP) IsInterfaceLocalMulticast() bool
    IsInterfaceLocalMulticast reports whether ip is an interface-local multicast
    address.

func (ip IP) IsLinkLocalMulticast() bool

    address "0.0.0.0" or the IPv6 address "::".

func (ip IP) MarshalText() ([]byte, error)
    MarshalText implements the encoding.TextMarshaler interface. The encoding is
    the same as returned by IP.String, with one exception: When len(ip) is zero,
    it returns an empty slice.

func (ip IP) Mask(mask IPMask) IP
    Mask returns the result of masking the IP address ip with mask.

func (ip IP) String() string
    String returns the string form of the IP address ip. It returns one of 4
    forms:
      - "<nil>", if ip has length 0
      - dotted decimal ("192.0.2.1"), if ip is an IPv4 or IP4-mapped IPv6
        address
      - IPv6 conforming to RFC 5952 ("2001:db8::1"), if ip is a valid IPv6
        address
      - the hexadecimal form of ip, without punctuation, if no other cases apply

func (ip IP) To16() IP
    To16 converts the IP address ip to a 16-byte representation. If ip is not an
    IP address (it is the wrong length), To16 returns nil.

func (ip IP) To4() IP

    network connections.

func (c *IPConn) Close() error
    Close closes the connection.

func (c *IPConn) File() (f *os.File, err error)
    File returns a copy of the underlying os.File. It is the caller's
    responsibility to close f when finished. Closing c does not affect f,
    and closing f does not affect c.

    The returned os.File's file descriptor is different from the connection's.
    Attempting to change properties of the original using this duplicate may or
    may not have the desired effect.

    On Windows, the returned os.File's file descriptor is not usable on other
    processes.

func (c *IPConn) LocalAddr() Addr
    LocalAddr returns the local network address. The Addr returned is shared by
    all invocations of LocalAddr, so do not modify it.

func (c *IPConn) Read(b []byte) (int, error)

    WriteToIP acts like IPConn.WriteTo but takes an IPAddr.

type IPMask []byte
    An IPMask is a bitmask that can be used to manipulate IP addresses for IP
    addressing and routing.

    See type IPNet and func ParseCIDR for details.

func CIDRMask(ones, bits int) IPMask
    CIDRMask returns an IPMask consisting of 'ones' 1 bits followed by 0s up
    to a total length of 'bits' bits. For a mask of this form, CIDRMask is the
    inverse of IPMask.Size.

func IPv4Mask(a, b, c, d byte) IPMask

    String returns the CIDR notation of n like "192.0.2.0/24" or "2001:db8::/48"
    as defined in RFC 4632 and RFC 4291. If the mask is not in the canonical
    form, it returns the string which consists of an IP address, followed by a
    slash character and a mask expressed as hexadecimal form with no punctuation
    like "198.51.100.0/c000ff00".

type Interface struct {
	Index        int          // positive integer that starts at one, zero is never used
	MTU          int          // maximum transmission unit
	Name         string       // e.g., "en0", "lo0", "eth0.100"; may be the empty string
	HardwareAddr HardwareAddr // IEEE MAC-48, EUI-48 and EUI-64 form
	Flags        Flags        // e.g., FlagUp, FlagLoopback, FlagMulticast

type InvalidAddrError string

func (e InvalidAddrError) Error() string

func (e InvalidAddrError) Temporary() bool

func (e InvalidAddrError) Timeout() bool

type KeepAliveConfig struct {
	// If Enable is true, keep-alive probes are enabled.
	Enable bool

	// Idle is the time that the connection must be idle before
	// the first keep-alive probe is sent.
	// If zero, a default value of 15 seconds is used.
	Idle time.Duration

	// Interval is the time between keep-alive probes.
	// If zero, a default value of 15 seconds is used.
	Interval time.Duration

	// Count is the maximum number of keep-alive probes that
	// can go unanswered before dropping a connection.
	// If zero, a default value of 9 is used.
	Count int
}
    KeepAliveConfig contains TCP keep-alive options.

    If the Idle, Interval, or Count fields are zero, a default value is chosen.
    If a field is negative, the corresponding socket-level option will be left
    unchanged.

    Note that prior to Windows 10 version 1709, neither setting Idle and
    Interval separately nor changing Count (which is usually 10) is supported.
    Therefore, it's recommended to set both Idle and Interval to non-negative
    values in conjunction with a -1 for Count on those old Windows if you intend
    to customize the TCP keep-alive settings. By contrast, if only one of Idle
    and Interval is set to a non-negative value, the other will be set to the
    system default value, and ultimately, set both Idle and Interval to negative
    values if you want to leave them unchanged.

    Note that Solaris and its derivatives do not support setting Interval to a
    non-negative value and Count to a negative value, or vice-versa.

type ListenConfig struct {
	// If Control is not nil, it is called after creating the network

func (lc *ListenConfig) MultipathTCP() bool
    MultipathTCP reports whether MPTCP will be used.

    This method doesn't check if MPTCP is supported by the operating system or
    not.

func (lc *ListenConfig) SetMultipathTCP(use bool)
    SetMultipathTCP directs the Listen method to use, or not use, MPTCP, if
    supported by the operating system. This method overrides the system default
    and the GODEBUG=multipathtcp=... setting if any.

    If MPTCP is not available on the host or not supported by the client,
    the Listen method will fall back to TCP.

    remaining results, if any.

func (r *Resolver) LookupCNAME(ctx context.Context, host string) (string, error)
    LookupCNAME returns the canonical name for the given host. Callers that do
    not care about the canonical name can call LookupHost or LookupIP directly;
    both take care of resolving the canonical name as part of the lookup.

    A canonical name is the final name after following zero or more CNAME
    records. LookupCNAME does not return an error if host does not contain DNS
    "CNAME" records, as long as host resolves to address records.

    The returned canonical name is validated to be a properly formatted
    presentation-format domain name.

func (r *Resolver) LookupHost(ctx context.Context, host string) (addrs []string, err error)

    preference.

    The returned mail server names are validated to be properly formatted
    presentation-format domain names, or numeric IP addresses. If the response
    contains invalid names, those records are filtered out and an error will be
    returned alongside the remaining results, if any.

func (r *Resolver) LookupNS(ctx context.Context, name string) ([]*NS, error)
    LookupNS returns the DNS NS records for the given domain name.

    LookupSRV tries to resolve an SRV query of the given service, protocol,
    and domain name. The proto is "tcp" or "udp". The returned records are
    sorted by priority and randomized by weight within a priority.

    LookupSRV constructs the DNS name to look up following RFC 2782. That is,
    it looks up _service._proto.name. To accommodate services publishing SRV
    records under non-standard names, if both service and proto are empty
    strings, LookupSRV looks up name directly.

    The returned service names are validated to be properly formatted
    presentation-format domain names. If the response contains invalid names,
    those records are filtered out and an error will be returned alongside the
    remaining results, if any.

func (r *Resolver) LookupTXT(ctx context.Context, name string) ([]string, error)

    normally 1 second.

func (c *TCPConn) SetLinger(sec int) error
    SetLinger sets the behavior of Close on a connection which still has data
    waiting to be sent or to be acknowledged.

    If sec < 0 (the default), the operating system finishes sending the data in
    the background.

    If sec == 0, the operating system discards any unsent or unacknowledged
    data.

    If sec > 0, the data is sent in the background as with sec < 0. On some
    operating systems including Linux, this may cause Close to block until all
    data has been sent or discarded. On some operating systems after sec seconds
    have elapsed any remaining unsent data may be discarded.

func (c *TCPConn) SetNoDelay(noDelay bool) error
    SetNoDelay controls whether the operating system should delay packet
    transmission in hopes of sending fewer packets (Nagle's algorithm). The

func (c *UnixConn) ReadFrom(b []byte) (int, Addr, error)
    ReadFrom implements the PacketConn.ReadFrom method.

func (c *UnixConn) ReadFromUnix(b []byte) (int, *UnixAddr, error)
    ReadFromUnix acts like UnixConn.ReadFrom but returns a UnixAddr.

func (c *UnixConn) ReadMsgUnix(b, oob []byte) (n, oobn, flags int, addr *UnixAddr, err error)
    ReadMsgUnix reads a message from c, copying the payload into b and the
    associated out-of-band data into oob. It returns the number of bytes copied
    into b, the number of bytes copied into oob, the flags that were set on the
    message and the source address of the message.

    Note that if len(b) == 0 and len(oob) > 0, this function will still read
    (and discard) 1 byte from the connection.

func (c *UnixConn) RemoteAddr() Addr
    RemoteAddr returns the remote network address. The Addr returned is shared
    by all invocations of RemoteAddr, so do not modify it.

func (c *UnixConn) SetDeadline(t time.Time) error
    SetDeadline implements the Conn SetDeadline method.

func (c *UnixConn) SetReadBuffer(bytes int) error
    SetReadBuffer sets the size of the operating system's receive buffer
    associated with the connection.

func (c *UnixConn) SetReadDeadline(t time.Time) error
    SetReadDeadline implements the Conn SetReadDeadline method.

func (c *UnixConn) SetWriteBuffer(bytes int) error
    SetWriteBuffer sets the size of the operating system's transmit buffer
    associated with the connection.

func (c *UnixConn) SetWriteDeadline(t time.Time) error
    SetWriteDeadline implements the Conn SetWriteDeadline method.

func (c *UnixConn) SyscallConn() (syscall.RawConn, error)
    SyscallConn returns a raw network connection. This implements the
    syscall.Conn interface.

func (c *UnixConn) Write(b []byte) (int, error)
    Write implements the Conn Write method.

func (c *UnixConn) WriteMsgUnix(b, oob []byte, addr *UnixAddr) (n, oobn int, err error)
    WriteMsgUnix writes a message to addr via c, copying the payload from b and
    the associated out-of-band data from oob. It returns the number of payload
    and out-of-band bytes written.

    Note that if len(b) == 0 and len(oob) > 0, this function will still write 1
    byte to the connection.

func (c *UnixConn) WriteTo(b []byte, addr Addr) (int, error)
    WriteTo implements the PacketConn.WriteTo method.

func (c *UnixConn) WriteToUnix(b []byte, addr *UnixAddr) (int, error)
    WriteToUnix acts like UnixConn.WriteTo but takes a UnixAddr.

type UnixListener struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    UnixListener is a Unix domain socket listener. Clients should typically use
    variables of type Listener instead of assuming Unix domain sockets.

func (l *UnixListener) Accept() (Conn, error)
    Accept implements the Accept method in the Listener interface. Returned
    connections will be of type *UnixConn.

func (l *UnixListener) AcceptUnix() (*UnixConn, error)
    AcceptUnix accepts the next incoming call and returns the new connection.

func (l *UnixListener) Addr() Addr
    Addr returns the listener's network address. The Addr returned is shared by
    all invocations of Addr, so do not modify it.

func (l *UnixListener) Close() error
    Close stops listening on the Unix address. Already accepted connections are
    not closed.

func (l *UnixListener) File() (f *os.File, err error)
    File returns a copy of the underlying os.File. It is the caller's
    responsibility to close f when finished. Closing l does not affect f,
    and closing f does not affect l.

    The returned os.File's file descriptor is different from the connection's.
    Attempting to change properties of the original using this duplicate may or
    may not have the desired effect.

    On Windows, the returned os.File's file descriptor is not usable on other
    processes.

func (l *UnixListener) SetDeadline(t time.Time) error
    SetDeadline sets the deadline associated with the listener. A zero time
    value disables the deadline.

func (l *UnixListener) SetUnlinkOnClose(unlink bool)
    SetUnlinkOnClose sets whether the underlying socket file should be removed
    from the file system when the listener is closed.

    The default behavior is to unlink the socket file only when package net
    created it. That is, when the listener and the underlying socket file were
    created by a call to Listen or ListenUnix, then by default closing the
    listener will remove the socket file. but if the listener was created by a
    call to FileListener to use an already existing socket file, then by default
    closing the listener will not remove the socket file.

func (l *UnixListener) SyscallConn() (syscall.RawConn, error)
    SyscallConn returns a raw network connection. This implements the
    syscall.Conn interface.

    The returned syscall.RawConn only supports calling Control. Read and Write
    return an error.

BUG: On JS, the FileConn, FileListener and
FilePacketConn functions are not implemented.

BUG: On JS, methods and functions related to
Interface are not implemented.

BUG: On AIX, DragonFly BSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Plan 9 and
Solaris, the MulticastAddrs method of Interface is not implemented.

BUG: On every POSIX platform, reads from the "ip4" network
using the ReadFrom or ReadFromIP method might not return a complete
IPv4 packet, including its header, even if there is space
available. This can occur even in cases where Read or ReadMsgIP
could return a complete packet. For this reason, it is recommended
that you do not use these methods if it is important to receive a
full packet.

The Go 1 compatibility guidelines make it impossible for us to
change the behavior of these methods; use Read or ReadMsgIP
instead.

BUG: On JS and Plan 9, methods and functions related
to IPConn are not implemented.

BUG: On DragonFly BSD and OpenBSD, listening on the
"tcp" and "udp" networks does not listen for both IPv4 and IPv6
connections. This is due to the fact that IPv4 traffic will not be
routed to an IPv6 socket - two separate sockets are required if
both address families are to be supported.
See inet6(4) for details.

BUG: On Windows, the Write method of syscall.RawConn
does not integrate with the runtime's network poller. It cannot
wait for the connection to become writeable, and does not respect
deadlines. If the user-provided callback returns false, the Write
method will fail immediately.

BUG: On JS and Plan 9, the Control, Read and Write
methods of syscall.RawConn are not implemented.

BUG: On JS, the File method of TCPConn and
TCPListener is not implemented.

BUG: On Plan 9, the ReadMsgUDP and
WriteMsgUDP methods of UDPConn are not implemented.

BUG: On JS, methods and functions related to UDPConn are not
implemented.

BUG: On JS, WASIP1 and Plan 9, methods and functions related
to UnixConn and UnixListener are not implemented.

BUG: On Windows, methods and functions related to UnixConn
and UnixListener don't work for "unixgram" and "unixpacket".
