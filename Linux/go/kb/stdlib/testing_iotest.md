FUNCTIONS

func DataErrReader(r io.Reader) io.Reader
    DataErrReader changes the way errors are handled by a Reader. Normally,
    a Reader returns an error (typically EOF) from the first Read call after
    the last piece of data is read. DataErrReader wraps a Reader and changes
    its behavior so the final error is returned along with the final data,
    instead of in the first call after the final data.

func ErrReader(err error) io.Reader
    ErrReader returns an io.Reader that returns 0, err from all Read calls.

func HalfReader(r io.Reader) io.Reader
    HalfReader returns a Reader that implements Read by reading half as many
    requested bytes from r.

func NewReadLogger(prefix string, r io.Reader) io.Reader
    NewReadLogger returns a reader that behaves like r except that it logs
    (using log.Printf) each read to standard error, printing the prefix and the
    hexadecimal data read.

func NewWriteLogger(prefix string, w io.Writer) io.Writer
    NewWriteLogger returns a writer that behaves like w except that it logs
    (using log.Printf) each write to standard error, printing the prefix and the
    hexadecimal data written.

func OneByteReader(r io.Reader) io.Reader
    OneByteReader returns a Reader that implements each non-empty Read by
    reading one byte from r.

func TestReader(r io.Reader, content []byte) error
    TestReader tests that reading from r returns the expected file content.
    It does reads of different sizes, until EOF. If r implements io.ReaderAt
    or io.Seeker, TestReader also checks that those operations behave as they
    should.

    If TestReader finds any misbehaviors, it returns an error reporting them.
    The error text may span multiple lines.

func TimeoutReader(r io.Reader) io.Reader
    TimeoutReader returns ErrTimeout on the second read with no data. Subsequent
    calls to read succeed.

func TruncateWriter(w io.Writer, n int64) io.Writer
    TruncateWriter returns a Writer that writes to w but stops silently after n
    bytes.
