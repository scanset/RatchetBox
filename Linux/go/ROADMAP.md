# ROADMAP - building out the go ratchet

Working plan for growing `Linux/go` from a single generate-build-repair MVP into the full
cross-platform reference ratchet. Plain and grounded; verify each step, don't assert. Domain logic
only - no engine changes (those live in the Ratchet repo).

## Where it stands today

A clean MVP that proves the loop end to end:

- one flow: `flows/go/` - generate -> `go build` -> done | fix -> rebuild -> done | fail (bounded,
  unrolled repair, no cycle).
- one oracle tool: `tools/go_check.sh` - reads a Go file on stdin, writes it into a throwaway module,
  type-checks it as a library package (`package solution`, no `func main`). Exit 0 = type-checks.
- one KB file: `kb/go-idioms.md` (single manifest entry; under-routed).
- `ratchet.json` seats: generate `qwen3-coder`, dispatch `phi3:mini`, embed `nomic-embed-text`.

The mature targets to grow toward are the Windows ratchets: `Windows/dotnet4-x` (7 flows, 16 tools,
77-file KB across 5 libraries, full project lifecycle, spec-to-code `compose`) and `Windows/cpp`
(plan-routed retrieval over 7 KBs, lifecycle, native run, vcpkg). That is the parity gap.

This is a Linux-first ratchet: every tool is a POSIX shell script (`.sh`) dispatched to bash. The
`.ps1` siblings are a later, optional add for native Windows; they are not the focus. The bash oracle
already runs on Linux, WSL, and macOS, which is the cross-platform claim that matters.

## 0. Toolbelt check (do this first, like cpp's doctor)

`Windows/cpp` ships a domain probe (`tools/doctor_cl.ps1`) wired into `ratchet.json` `requirements`
as `{ "name": "MSVC cl", "tool": "doctor_cl" }`, so `ratchet doctor` reports whether the real
toolchain is reachable before any flow runs. The go ratchet needs the same: a `tools/doctor_go.sh`
that probes `go` + the optional linters and reports what is available, so flows can gate on it
(e.g. skip the staticcheck oracle when staticcheck is absent).

Scan of this box (Linux, go1.26.4, 2026-06-25) - what the toolbelt actually has:

| Tool | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `go` | present | go1.26.4 linux/amd64 at /usr/local/go/bin |
| `gofmt` | present | ships with go - `go_fmt` oracle works now |
| `go vet` | present | subcommand - `go_vet` oracle works now |
| `go test` | present | subcommand - `go_test` oracle works now |
| `go build` | present | already the `go_build` oracle |
| bash / sh | present | tool dispatch target |
| ollama | reachable | OLLAMA_URL points at the Windows-host gateway; models pulled |
| `goimports` | MISSING | `go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest` (optional, import-fixing) |
| `staticcheck` | MISSING | `go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest` (optional stricter oracle) |
| `golangci-lint` | MISSING | optional meta-linter |
| `dlv`, `gopls` | MISSING | dev tooling, not needed by the ratchet |

Takeaway: the entire behavior-ratchet stack (`gofmt` -> `go vet` -> `go build` -> `go test`) is
available today with **zero extra installs**. The optional tools above are nice-to-have, gated by
`doctor_go.sh`, not blockers. Build phase 1 against the stdlib toolchain; treat staticcheck as opt-in.

## The thesis: ratchet on behavior, not just "it compiles"

The C# and C++ ratchets stop their oracle at "it compiles." Go's toolchain is richer and pure-Go
(no cgo, fits the engine's `CGO_ENABLED=0` rule), so the go ratchet can go further:

`gofmt` (canonicalize) -> `go vet` (suspicious-but-buildable) -> `go build` (type-check) ->
`go test` (behavior) -> `go run` (run-verify).

`go test` is the headline: generate solution + tests and ratchet until the tests pass. That is a
capability the existing ratchets cannot cleanly express. Build the roadmap around it.

## 1. Tools (oracles) - layer them

Every tool is a POSIX `.sh` script (Linux-first), dispatched to bash by extension. `.ps1` siblings
are deferred (see section 4). All pure-Go toolchain, no external deps beyond `go` (staticcheck
optional, ships as a static binary).

| Tool | Verdict (exit 0 = pass) | Available now | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `doctor_go` | probe: `go` + linters present | yes | Toolbelt check (section 0); gates optional oracles |
| `go_fmt` | `gofmt -l` empty / emits canonical source | yes | Cheap pre-pass; normalizes model output and kills the fence problem at the source instead of `sed`-stripping |
| `go_vet` | `go vet ./...` clean | yes | Catches printf-verb, shadowing, unreachable, struct-tag bugs `go build` accepts |
| `go_build` | `go build ./...` (have it) | yes | Type-check, library package |
| `go_test` | `go test ./...` green | yes | Behavior - the real ratchet |
| `go_run` | `go run` a `package main`, capture stdout | yes | Run-verify an executable (analog of cpp `run_app`) |
| `go_mod` | `go mod tidy` / add a dep | yes | Deliberate opt-in to third-party modules |
| `go_staticcheck` | `staticcheck ./...` clean | opt-in | Stricter lint; gate on `doctor_go` since the binary is not installed here yet |

Note on `go_check.sh` today: it `sed`-strips markdown fences because the model emits them. A `go_fmt`
pre-pass is the cleaner fix - canonical source or a non-zero verdict, no regex.

## 2. Flows - climb the lifecycle ladder

Ordered by leverage:

1. **`go_test`** - generate solution + a test (or accept a provided one) -> `go test` -> repair.
   The capability the other ratchets lack. Start here.
2. **`gofix`** - take broken/ugly Go -> vet + build + repair -> return canonical. Pure-repair flow.
3. **Project lifecycle** (mirror dotnet4-x): `new_project` (scaffold a real module with `go.mod`) ->
   `add_file` / `edit_file`, each rebuilding the whole module via `go build ./...` (+ `go test ./...`).
   Go's module model is cleaner here than the C# `response.rsp` build.
4. **`compose`** - spec-dir -> plan build order -> `foreach` generate each file against the
   accumulated package -> `go build ./...` + `go test ./...`. Go packages accumulate more naturally
   than C# files do.
5. **structured/`generate` with `output_schema`** - JSON-shaped tasks (struct + tags), oracle =
   build + a marshalling round-trip test.

Reuse the existing unrolled-repair shape (generate -> verify -> done | fix -> reverify -> done | fail)
so chains lint clean and terminate; no cycles.

## 3. Knowledge bases - cpp-style ingested libraries

PROGRESS (2026-06-25): adopted the cpp multi-library model (one `kb/<lib>/` per source, each
registered separately and indexed to its own manifest), not the single recursive KB. Shipped:

- `tools/kb_ingest_godoc.sh` - deterministic, offline, no-model ingest of the Go standard library via
  `go doc -all`, one markdown per package. The Go analog of cpp's `cppref` ingest; `go doc` generates
  it locally so there is nothing to scrape and it matches the installed toolchain.
- `kb/stdlib/` - 176 package reference files (2.7 MB), registered as the `stdlib` KB, indexed (176
  manifest entries). Retrieval verified: `/search stdlib <heap query>` routes to `container/heap` and
  grounds a correct `heap.Interface` priority queue - the exact API run 10 got wrong.
- `kb/idioms/` - the former single `go-idioms.md`, now its own library (the `kb` default), so the
  default KB no longer sits at the kb root and does not absorb `stdlib`.
- `kb/README.md` - the library index (sources, build commands, how to add one).

REMAINING libraries (the routed taxonomy below). Author `patterns/` + `pitfalls/` from the run
evidence first (cheap, high-signal); `guidelines/` + `spec/` are split-ingests of external text
(Effective Go, Code Review Comments, Go Proverbs, the language spec) - confirm sourcing before fetch.
Wiring flows to search `stdlib` (and plan-routing across libraries, cpp-style) is its own step.

### The routed taxonomy

`kb/go-idioms.md` is a single entry today, so routing has almost nothing to discriminate on. Mirror
the dotnet `reference/patterns/recipes/scaffold/snippets` taxonomy, Go-flavored, one topic per file
with a sharp one-line `summary` (routing sees only the summary), then `ratchet index <go>/kb`:

- **`reference/`** - stdlib facts the model gets wrong: error wrapping (`%w`), `context` rules,
  slice/map aliasing, goroutine/channel semantics, generics constraints, `go.mod` versioning.
- **`patterns/`** - complete units: worker pool, `errgroup`, table-driven test, `io.Reader` pipeline,
  functional options, HTTP handler.
- **`recipes/`** - playbooks: CLI with flag parsing + tests, JSON API client, fan-out/fan-in.
- **`pitfalls/`** - builds-but-wrong: loop-var capture, nil-map write, unbuffered-channel deadlock,
  `defer` in a loop. Pairs with the `go_vet` / `go_test` oracles.
- **`scaffold/`** - `go.mod` + package-layout templates for `new_project` / `compose`.

Migrate the current `go-idioms.md` content into `reference/` and `patterns/` rather than deleting it.

## 4. Cross-platform finish (deferred - Linux-first)

We author and run on Linux, so every tool is a `.sh` script and that is the supported path. The
bash oracle already covers Linux, WSL, and macOS. A later, optional pass can add a `.ps1` sibling
per oracle for native Windows; it is not in scope for the phases below and should not slow them down.

## Phased sequence

1. DONE (2026-06-25) - `doctor_go.sh` toolbelt probe (wired into `ratchet.json` requirements) +
   the behavior flow + oracle. Shipped: `tools/doctor_go.sh`, `tools/go_test.sh` (gofmt-normalize ->
   `go vet` -> `go test`, requires a `*_test.go` so an empty package is not a silent false pass),
   `flows/test/` (generate impl+test -> check -> done | fix -> recheck -> fail), `flows/manifest.json`.
   Verified: `validate-flow` clean (go + test), `doctor` green incl. the toolbelt probe, the oracle
   unit-tested on 4 payloads (pass / behaviorally-wrong / no-test / fenced+vet-bug all correct), and a
   live end-to-end run (FizzBuzz) generated a real table-driven test and passed first try
   (run `20260625-170206-296`). `gofmt`/`go vet`/`go test` are folded into the one `go_test` oracle;
   split them into standalone oracle nodes later only if the run evidence shows it helps attribution.
2. Split + grow the KB into the routed taxonomy.
3. Project lifecycle (`new_project` -> `add_file` / `edit_file`).
4. `compose` from specs.
5. `.ps1` oracle siblings for native Windows parity.

## Open decisions (settle before building each phase)

- **Test sourcing for `go_test`**: model generates the test too, or operator supplies it, or both
  (generate when absent). Self-generated tests can be gamed by weak models; consider an oracle that
  rejects trivial/empty tests.
- **Library vs main package**: `go_build` uses `package solution` (library). `go_run` and lifecycle
  need `package main`. Decide per flow; keep the library default for one-shot snippets.
- **Module identity in lifecycle**: one module per workspace (`go.mod` at `workspaces/<name>`), build
  with `go build ./...`. Confirm the engine's workspace/`--ws` plumbing matches dotnet4-x's.
- **Dispatch seat**: `phi3:mini` for dispatch today; confirm it is strong enough to route over a
  5-library KB, or move dispatch to `qwen3-coder`.
- **staticcheck**: include as an optional stricter oracle, or keep to the stdlib `go vet` only.

## Verify after each change

```
ratchet validate-flow <go>     # lint every chain (node kinds, fields, unknown tools, reachability)
ratchet doctor <go>            # preflight declared tools (go on PATH, models pulled)
ratchet index <go>/kb          # rebuild the KB routing index after editing kb/
ratchet flow <go> <chain> "<task>"   # end-to-end against Ollama
```

"Builds" is not "behaves" - once `go_test` lands, prove behavior with a real failing-then-passing run.
