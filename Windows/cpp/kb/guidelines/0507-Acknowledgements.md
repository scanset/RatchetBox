# <a name="s-profile"></a>Pro: Profiles

Ideally, we would follow all of the guidelines.
That would give the cleanest, most regular, least error-prone, and often the fastest code.
Unfortunately, that is usually impossible because we have to fit our code into large code bases and use existing libraries.
Often, such code has been written over decades and does not follow these guidelines.
We must aim for [gradual adoption](#s-modernizing).

Whatever strategy for gradual adoption we adopt, we need to be able to apply sets of related guidelines to address some set
of problems first and leave the rest until later.
A similar idea of "related guidelines" becomes important when some, but not all, guidelines are considered relevant to a code base
or if a set of specialized guidelines is to be applied for a specialized application area.
We call such a set of related guidelines a "profile".
We aim for such a set of guidelines to be coherent so that they together help us reach a specific goal, such as "absence of range errors"
or "static type safety."
Each profile is designed to eliminate a class of errors.
Enforcement of "random" rules in isolation is more likely to be disruptive to a code base than delivering a definite improvement.

A "profile" is a set of deterministic and portably enforceable subset of rules (i.e., restrictions) that are designed to achieve a specific guarantee.
"Deterministic" means they require only local analysis and could be implemented in a compiler (though they don't need to be).
"Portably enforceable" means they are like language rules, so programmers can count on different enforcement tools giving the same answer for the same code.

Code written to be warning-free using such a language profile is considered to conform to the profile.
Conforming code is considered to be safe by construction with regard to the safety properties targeted by that profile.
Conforming code will not be the root cause of errors for that property,
although such errors might be introduced into a program by other code, libraries or the external environment.
A profile might also introduce additional library types to ease conformance and encourage correct code.

Profiles summary:

* [Pro.type: Type safety](#ss-type)
* [Pro.bounds: Bounds safety](#ss-bounds)
* [Pro.lifetime: Lifetime safety](#ss-lifetime)

In the future, we expect to define many more profiles and add more checks to existing profiles.
Candidates include:

* narrowing arithmetic promotions/conversions (likely part of a separate safe-arithmetic profile)
* arithmetic cast from negative floating point to unsigned integral type (ditto)
* selected undefined behavior: Start with Gabriel Dos Reis's UB list developed for the WG21 study group
* selected unspecified behavior: Addressing portability concerns.
* `const` violations: Mostly done by compilers already, but we can catch inappropriate casting and underuse of `const`.

Enabling a profile is implementation defined; typically, it is set in the analysis tool used.

To suppress enforcement of a profile check, place a `suppress` annotation on a language contract. For example:

    [[suppress("bounds")]] char* raw_find(char* p, int n, char x)    // find x in p[0]..p[n - 1]
    {
        // ...
    }

Now `raw_find()` can scramble memory to its heart's content.
Obviously, suppression should be very rare.
