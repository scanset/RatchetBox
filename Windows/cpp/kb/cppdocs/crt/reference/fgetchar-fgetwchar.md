# `_fgetchar`, `_fgetwchar`

Reads a character from `stdin`.

## Syntax

```C
int _fgetchar( void );
wint_t _fgetwchar( void );
```

## Return value

**\_fgetchar** returns the character read as an **`int`** or returns `EOF` to indicate an error or end of file. **\_fgetwchar** returns, as a [`wint_t`](../standard-types.md), the wide character that corresponds to the character read or returns `WEOF` to indicate an error or end of file. For both functions, use `feof` or `ferror` to distinguish between an error and an end-of-file condition.

## Remarks

These functions read a single character from `stdin`. The function then increments the associated file pointer (if defined) to point to the next character. If the stream is at end of file, the end-of-file indicator for the stream is set.

**`_fgetchar`** is equivalent to `fgetc( stdin )`. It's also equivalent to `getchar`, but implemented only as a function, rather than as a function and a macro. **`_fgetwchar`** is the wide-character version of **`_fgetchar`**.

These functions aren't compatible with the ANSI standard.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](../global-state.md).

### Generic-text routine mappings

| Tchar.h routine | `_UNICODE` and `_MBCS` not defined | `_MBCS` defined | `_UNICODE` defined |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_fgettchar` | **`_fgetchar`** | **`_fgetchar`** | **`_fgetwchar`** |

## Requirements

| Function | Required header |
|---|---|
| **`_fgetchar`** | \<stdio.h> |
| **`_fgetwchar`** | \<stdio.h> or \<wchar.h> |

The console isn't supported in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. The standard stream handles that are associated with the console—`stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`—must be redirected before C run-time functions can use them in UWP apps. For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../compatibility.md).

## Example

```C
// crt_fgetchar.c
// This program uses _fgetchar to read the first
// 80 input characters (or until the end of input)
// and place them into a string named buffer.
//

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main( void )
{
   char buffer[81];
   int  i, ch;

   // Read in first 80 characters and place them in "buffer":
   ch = _fgetchar();
   for( i=0; (i < 80 ) && ( feof( stdin ) == 0 ); i++ )
   {
      buffer[i] = (char)ch;
      ch = _fgetchar();
   }

   // Add null to end string
   buffer[i] = '\0';
   printf( "%s\n", buffer );
}
```

```Output

      Line one.
Line two.Line one.
Line two.
```
