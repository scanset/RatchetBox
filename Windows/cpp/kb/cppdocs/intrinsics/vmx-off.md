# __vmx_off

**Microsoft Specific**

Deactivates virtual machine extensions (VMX) operation in the processor.

## Syntax

```C
void __vmx_off();
```

## Remarks

The `__vmx_off` function is equivalent to the `VMXOFF` machine instruction. This function supports the interaction of a host's virtual machine monitor with a guest operating system and its applications.
