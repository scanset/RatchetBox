# IsWindowArranged function (winuser.h)

Determines whether the specified window is arranged (that is, whether it's snapped). You should treat snapped as a window state similar to maximized or minimized. Also see [Snap your windows](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/snap-your-windows-885a9b1e-a983-a3b1-16cd-c531795e6241).

## Syntax

```cpp
BOOL IsWindowArranged(
  [in] HWND hwnd
);
```

## Parameters

`hwnd`

Type: **HWND**

A handle to the window to be tested.

## Return value

Type: **BOOL**

A nonzero value if the window is arranged; otherwise, zero.

## Remarks

At this time, this function does not have an associated header file or library file. Your application can call [**LoadLibrary**](/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya) with the DLL name (`User32.dll`) to obtain a module handle. It can then call [**GetProcAddress**](/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress) with the module handle and the name of this function to get the function address.

A snapped window (see [Snap your windows](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/snap-your-windows-885a9b1e-a983-a3b1-16cd-c531795e6241)) is considered to be arranged. You should treat arrange as a window state similar to maximize. Arranged, maximize, and minimize are mutually exclusive states. An arranged window can be restored to its original size and position. Restoring a window from minimize can make a window arranged if the window was arranged before it was minimized. When calling [GetWindowPlacement](/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getwindowplacement), keep in mind that the *showCmd* member on the returned [WINDOWPLACEMENT](/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-windowplacement) can have a value of **SW_SHOWNORMAL** even if the window is arranged.

## Example

```cpp
// Check whether the window is in the restored state.
BOOL IsRestored(HWND hwnd)
{
  if (IsIconic(hwnd) || IsZoomed(hwnd) || IsWindowArranged(hwnd))
  {
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```
