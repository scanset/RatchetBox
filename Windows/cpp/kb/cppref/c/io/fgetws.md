wchar_t* fgetws( wchar_t* restrict str, int count, FILE* restrict stream );

(since C99)

Reads at most count - 1 wide characters from the given file stream and stores them in str. The produced wide string is always null-terminated. Parsing stops if end-of-file occurs or a newline wide character is found, in which case str will contain that wide newline character.

### Parameters

count

-
