wint_t ungetwc( wint_t ch, FILE *stream );

(since C95)

If ch does not equal WEOF, pushes the wide character ch into the input buffer associated with the stream stream in such a manner that subsequent read operation from stream will retrieve that wide character. The external device associated with the stream is not modified.

Stream repositioning operations fseek, fsetpos, and rewind discard the effects of ungetwc.

If ungetwc is called more than once without an intervening read or repositioning, it may fail (in other words, a pushback buffer of size 1 is guaranteed, but any larger buffer is implementation-defined). If multiple successful ungetwc were performed, read operations retrieve the pushed-back wide characters in reverse order of ungetwc

If ch equals WEOF, the operation fails and the stream is not affected.

A successful call to ungetwc clears the end of file status flag feof.

A successful call to ungetwc on a stream (whether text or binary) modifies the stream position indicator in unspecified manner but guarantees that after all pushed-back wide characters are retrieved with a read operation, the stream position indicator is equal to its value before ungetwc.

### Parameters

ch

-

wide character to be put back

stream

-

file stream to put the wide character back to

### Return value

On success ch is returned.

On failure WEOF is returned and the given stream remains unchanged.
