Defined in header <stdio.h>

int setvbuf( FILE *         stream, char *         buffer, 

             int mode, size_t size );

(until C99)

int setvbuf( FILE *restrict stream, char *restrict buffer, 

             int mode, size_t size );

(since C99)

#define _IOFBF     /*unspecified*/

#define _IOLBF     /*unspecified*/

#define _IONBF     /*unspecified*/

Changes the buffering mode of the given file stream stream as indicated by the argument mode. In addition,

- If buffer is a null pointer, resizes the internal buffer to size.

- If buffer is not a null pointer, instructs the stream to use the user-provided buffer of size size beginning at buffer. The stream must be closed (with fclose) before the lifetime of the array pointed to by buffer ends. The contents of the array after a successful call to setvbuf are indeterminate and any attempt to use it is undefined behavior.

### Parameters

stream

-

the file stream to set the buffer to

buffer

-

pointer to a buffer for the stream to use or null pointer to change size and mode only

mode

-

buffering mode to use. It can be one of the following values:

_IOFBF

full buffering

_IOLBF

line buffering

_IONBF

no buffering

size

-

size of the buffer

### Return value

​0​ on success or nonzero on failure.

### Notes

This function may only be used after stream has been associated with an open file, but before any other operation (other than a failed call to setbuf/setvbuf).

Not all size bytes will necessarily be used for buffering: the actual buffer size is usually rounded down to a multiple of 2, a multiple of page size, etc.

On many implementations, line buffering is only available for terminal input streams.

A common error is setting the buffer of stdin or stdout to an array whose lifetime ends before the program terminates:

int main(void) {
char buf[BUFSIZ];
setbuf(stdin, buf);
} // lifetime of buf ends, undefined behavior

The default buffer size BUFSIZ is expected to be the most efficient buffer size for file I/O on the implementation, but POSIX fstat often provides a better estimate.

### Example

One use case for changing buffer size is when a better size is known. (This example uses some POSIX function, e.g. fileno. See also SO: #1 and #2).

Run this code

// Make some POSIX functions, such as `int fileno(FILE*)`, visible:
#define _POSIX_SOURCE
 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
 
int main(void)
{
FILE* fp = fopen("/tmp/test.txt", "w+");
if (fp == NULL)
{
perror("fopen");
return EXIT_FAILURE;
}
 
struct stat stats;
if (fstat(fileno(fp), &stats) == -1) // POSIX only
{
perror("fstat");
return EXIT_FAILURE;
}
 
printf("BUFSIZ is %d, but optimal block size is %ld\n", BUFSIZ, stats.st_blksize);
if (setvbuf(fp, NULL, _IOFBF, stats.st_blksize) != 0)
{
perror("setvbuf failed"); // POSIX version sets errno
return EXIT_FAILURE;
}
 
int ch;
while((ch=fgetc(fp)) != EOF); // read entire file: use truss/strace to
// observe the read(2) syscalls used
 
fclose(fp);
return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

Possible output:

BUFSIZ is 8192, but optimal block size is 65536
