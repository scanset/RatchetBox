Defined in header <stdio.h>

int puts( const char* str );

Writes every character from the null-terminated string str and one additional newline character '\n' to the output stream stdout, as if by repeatedly executing fputc.

The terminating null character from str is not written.

### Parameters

str

-

character string to be written

### Return value

On success, returns a non-negative value.

On failure, returns EOF and sets the error indicator (see ferror()) on stream.

### Notes

The puts function appends the newline character to the output, while fputs function does not.

Different implementations return different non-negative numbers: some return the last character written, some return the number of characters written (or INT_MAX if the string was longer than that), some simply return a non-negative constant.

A typical cause of failure for puts is running out of space on the file system, when stdout is redirected to a file.

### Example

Run this code

#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(void)
{
int rc = puts("Hello World");
 
if (rc == EOF)
perror("puts()"); // POSIX requires that errno is set
}

Output:

Hello World
