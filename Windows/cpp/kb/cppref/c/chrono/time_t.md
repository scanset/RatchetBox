Defined in header <time.h>

typedef /* unspecified */ time_t;

Real arithmetic type capable of representing times.

Although not defined by the C standard, this is almost always an integral value holding the number of seconds (not counting leap seconds) since 00:00, Jan 1 1970 UTC, corresponding to POSIX time.

### Notes

The standard uses the term calendar time when referring to a value of type time_t.

### Example

Show the start of the epoch.

Run this code

#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <stdint.h>
 
int main(void)
{
time_t epoch = 0;
printf("%jd seconds since the epoch began\n", (intmax_t)epoch);
printf("%s", asctime(gmtime(&epoch)));
}

Possible output:

0 seconds since the epoch began
Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 1970
