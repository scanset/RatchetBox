Defined in header <time.h>

time_t time( time_t* arg );

Returns the current calendar time encoded as a time_t object, and also stores it in the time_t object pointed to by arg (unless arg is a null pointer)

### Parameters

arg

-

pointer to a time_t object where the time will be stored, or a null pointer

### Return value

Current calendar time encoded as time_t object on success, (time_t)(-1) on error. If arg is not a null pointer, the return value is also stored in the object pointed to by arg.

### Notes

The encoding of calendar time in time_t is unspecified, but most systems conform to POSIX specification and return a value of integral type holding the number of seconds since the Epoch. Implementations in which time_t is a 32-bit signed integer (many historical implementations) fail in the year 2038.

### Example

Run this code

#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
 
int main(void)
{
time_t result = time(NULL);
if (result != (time_t)(-1))
printf("The current time is %s(%jd seconds since the Epoch)\n",
asctime(gmtime(&result)), (intmax_t)result);
}

Possible output:

The current time is Fri Apr 24 15:05:25 2015
(1429887925 seconds since the Epoch)
