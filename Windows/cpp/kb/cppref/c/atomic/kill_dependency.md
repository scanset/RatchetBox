A kill_dependency( A y );

(since C11)

Informs the compiler that the dependency tree started by an memory_order_consume atomic load operation does not extend past the return value of kill_dependency; that is, the argument does not carry a dependency into the return value.

The function is implemented as a macro. A is the type of y.

### Parameters

y

-

the expression whose return value is to be removed from a dependency tree

### Return value

Returns y, no longer a part of a dependency tree.
