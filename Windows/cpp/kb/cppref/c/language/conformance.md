Conformance has a three-fold definition:

- strictly conforming program - uses only well-defined language constructs, that is constructs with a single behavior. It excludes unspecified, undefined, or implementation-defined behavior, and does not exceed any minimum implementation limit.

- conforming program - acceptable to a conforming implementation.

- conforming implementation -
A conforming hosted implementation shall accept any strictly conforming program.

- A conforming freestanding implementation shall accept any strictly conforming program in which the use of the features specified in the library clause (clause 7) is confined to the contents of the freestanding standard library headers (see below).

- A conforming implementation may have extensions (including additional library functions), provided they do not alter the behavior of any strictly conforming program.

### Explanation

The standard does not define any minimum implementation limit on translation units. A hosted environment has an operating system; a freestanding environment does not. A program running in a hosted environment may use all features described in the library clause (clause 7); a program running in a freestanding environment may use a subset of library features required by clause 4.

#### Freestanding standard library headers

All standard library features in every fully freestanding header are required to be provided by a freestanding implementation.

Some standard library headers are conditionally freestanding.

- If the implementation predefines the macro __STDC_IEC_60559_BFP__ or __STDC_IEC_60559_DFP__, then <math.h> and <fenv.h> are fully freestanding headers. However, the behavior of functions in these headers is required to be well-defined in a freestanding environment only if a program does not set the state of the FENV_ACCESS pragma to ON.

Some standard library headers are partially freestanding.

- In <stdlib.h>, memalignment is freestanding. Additionally, when __STDC_IEC_60559_BFP__ or __STDC_IEC_60559_DFP__ are predefined, numeric conversion functions (atoX, strtoX, and strfromX) are also freestanding, while their behavior is required to be well-defined in a freestanding environment only if a program does not set the state of the FENV_ACCESS pragma to ON. No other component in <stdlib.h> is required to be to be provided by a freestanding implementation.

- In <string.h>, strdup, strndup, strcoll, strxfrm, strtok, and strerror are not required to be provided by a freestanding implementation.
