An object whose identifier is declared without the storage-class specifier _Thread_local, and either with external or internal linkage or with the storage-class specifier static, has static storage duration. Its lifetime is the entire execution of the program and its stored value is initialized only once, prior to program startup.

### Notes

Since its stored value is initialized only once, an object with static storage duration can profile the invocations of a function.

The other use of the keyword static is file scope.

### Example

Run this code

#include <stdio.h>
 
void f (void)
{
static int count = 0; // static variable 
int i = 0; // automatic variable
printf("%d %d\n", i++, count++);
}
 
int main(void)
{
for (int ndx=0; ndx<10; ++ndx)
f();
}

Output:

0 0
0 1
0 2
0 3
0 4
0 5
0 6
0 7
