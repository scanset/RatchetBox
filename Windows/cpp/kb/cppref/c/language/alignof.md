Queries the alignment requirement of its operand type.

### Syntax

_Alignof( type-name )

(since C11)(deprecated in C23)

alignof( type-name )

(since C23)

This operator is typically used through the convenience macro alignof, which is provided in the header <stdalign.h>

(until C23)

### Explanation

Returns the alignment requirement of the type named by type-name. If type-name is an array type, the result is the alignment requirement of the array element type. The type-name cannot be function type or an incomplete type.

The result is an integer constant of type size_t.

The operand is not evaluated (so external identifiers used in the operand do not have to be defined).

If type-name is a VLA type, its size expression is not evaluated.

### Notes

The use of _Alignof(until C23)alignof(since C23) with expressions is allowed by some C compilers as a non-standard extension.

### Keywords

alignof,
_Alignof

### Example

Run this code

#include <stdalign.h>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(void)
{
printf("Alignment of char = %zu\n", alignof(char));
printf("Alignment of max_align_t = %zu\n", alignof(max_align_t));
printf("alignof(float[10]) = %zu\n", alignof(float[10]));
printf("alignof(struct{char c; int n;}) = %zu\n",
alignof(struct {char c; int n;}));
}

Possible output:

Alignment of char = 1
Alignment of max_align_t = 16
alignof(float[10]) = 4
alignof(struct{char c; int n;}) = 4
