1-3) Rounds the floating-point argument arg to an integer value in floating-point format, using the current rounding mode.

4) Type-generic macro: If arg has type long double, nearbyintl is called. Otherwise, if arg has integer type or the type double, nearbyint is called. Otherwise, nearbyintf is called, respectively.

### Parameters

arg

-

floating-point value

### Return value

The nearest integer value to arg, according to the current rounding mode, is returned.

### Error handling

This function is not subject to any of the errors specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- FE_INEXACT is never raised.

- If arg is ±∞, it is returned, unmodified.

- If arg is ±0, it is returned, unmodified.

- If arg is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

The only difference between nearbyint and rint is that nearbyint never raises FE_INEXACT.

The largest representable floating-point values are exact integers in all standard floating-point formats, so nearbyint never overflows on its own; however the result may overflow any integer type (including intmax_t), when stored in an integer variable.

If the current rounding mode is FE_TONEAREST, this function rounds to even in halfway cases (like rint, but unlike round).

### Example

Run this code

#include <fenv.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(void)
{
// #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
fesetround(FE_TONEAREST);
printf("rounding to nearest:\nnearbyint(+2.3) = %+.1f ", nearbyint(2.3));
printf("nearbyint(+2.5) = %+.1f ", nearbyint(2.5));
printf("nearbyint(+3.5) = %+.1f\n", nearbyint(3.5));
printf("nearbyint(-2.3) = %+.1f ", nearbyint(-2.3));
printf("nearbyint(-2.5) = %+.1f ", nearbyint(-2.5));
printf("nearbyint(-3.5) = %+.1f\n", nearbyint(-3.5));
 
fesetround(FE_DOWNWARD);
printf("rounding down: \nnearbyint(+2.3) = %+.1f ", nearbyint(2.3));
printf("nearbyint(+2.5) = %+.1f ", nearbyint(2.5));
printf("nearbyint(+3.5) = %+.1f\n", nearbyint(3.5));
printf("nearbyint(-2.3) = %+.1f ", nearbyint(-2.3));
printf("nearbyint(-2.5) = %+.1f ", nearbyint(-2.5));
printf("nearbyint(-3.5) = %+.1f\n", nearbyint(-3.5));
 
printf("nearbyint(-0.0) = %+.1f\n", nearbyint(-0.0));
printf("nearbyint(-Inf) = %+.1f\n", nearbyint(-INFINITY));
}

Output:

rounding to nearest:
nearbyint(+2.3) = +2.0 nearbyint(+2.5) = +2.0 nearbyint(+3.5) = +4.0
nearbyint(-2.3) = -2.0 nearbyint(-2.5) = -2.0 nearbyint(-3.5) = -4.0
rounding down:
nearbyint(+2.3) = +2.0 nearbyint(+2.5) = +2.0 nearbyint(+3.5) = +3.0
nearbyint(-2.3) = -3.0 nearbyint(-2.5) = -3.0 nearbyint(-3.5) = -4.0
nearbyint(-0.0) = -0.0
nearbyint(-Inf) = -inf
