1-3) Computes the IEEE remainder of the floating-point division operation x/y.

4) Type-generic macro: If any argument has type long double, remainderl is called. Otherwise, if any argument has integer type or has type double, remainder is called. Otherwise, remainderf is called.

The IEEE floating-point remainder of the division operation x/y calculated by this function is exactly the value x - n * y, where the value n is the integral value nearest the exact value x/y. When |n-x/y| = ½, the value n is chosen to be even.

In contrast to fmod(), the returned value is not guaranteed to have the same sign as x.

If the returned value is ​0​, it will have the same sign as x.

### Parameters

x, y

-

floating-point values

### Return value

If successful, returns the IEEE floating-point remainder of the division x/y as defined above.

If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned (NaN where supported).

If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result is returned.

If y is zero, but the domain error does not occur, zero is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

Domain error may occur if y is zero.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- The current rounding mode has no effect.

- FE_INEXACT is never raised, the result is always exact.

- If x is ±∞ and y is not NaN, NaN is returned and FE_INVALID is raised.

- If y is ±0 and x is not NaN, NaN is returned and FE_INVALID is raised.

- If either argument is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

POSIX requires that a domain error occurs if x is infinite or y is zero.

fmod, but not remainder is useful for doing silent wrapping of floating-point types to unsigned integer types: (0.0 <= (y = fmod(rint(x), 65536.0)) ? y : 65536.0 + y) is in the range [-0.0, 65535.0], which corresponds to unsigned short, but remainder(rint(x), 65536.0) is in the range [-32767.0, +32768.0], which is outside of the range of signed short.

### Example

Run this code

#include <fenv.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
// #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
 
int main(void)
{
printf("remainder(+5.1, +3.0) = %.1f\n", remainder(5.1, 3));
printf("remainder(-5.1, +3.0) = %.1f\n", remainder(-5.1, 3));
printf("remainder(+5.1, -3.0) = %.1f\n", remainder(5.1, -3));
printf("remainder(-5.1, -3.0) = %.1f\n", remainder(-5.1, -3));
 
// special values
printf("remainder(-0.0, 1.0) = %.1f\n", remainder(-0.0, 1));
printf("remainder(+5.1, Inf) = %.1f\n", remainder(5.1, INFINITY));
 
// error handling
feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
printf("remainder(+5.1, 0) = %.1f\n", remainder(5.1, 0));
if (fetestexcept(FE_INVALID))
puts(" FE_INVALID raised");
}

Output:

remainder(+5.1, +3.0) = -0.9
remainder(-5.1, +3.0) = 0.9
remainder(+5.1, -3.0) = -0.9
remainder(-5.1, -3.0) = 0.9
remainder(+0.0, 1.0) = 0.0
remainder(-0.0, 1.0) = -0.0
remainder(+5.1, Inf) = 5.1
remainder(+5.1, 0) = -nan
FE_INVALID raised
