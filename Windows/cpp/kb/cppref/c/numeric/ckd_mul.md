Defined in header <stdckdint.h>

#define ckd_mul( result, a, b ) /* implementation-defined */

// exposed interface:

bool ckd_mul( type1* result, type2 a, type3 b );

(since C23)

Computes the multiplication x × y and stores the result into *result. The multiplication is performed as if both operands were represented in a signed integer type with infinite range, and the result was then converted from this integer type to type1. If the value assigned to *result correctly represents the mathematical result of the operation, it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true. In this case, the value assigned to *result is the mathematical result of the operation wrapped around to the width of *result.

### Parameters

a, b

-

integer values

result

-

address of where result should be stored

### Return value

false if the value assigned to *result correctly represents the mathematical result of the multiplication, true otherwise.

### Note

Both type2 and type3 shall be any integer type other than "plain" char, bool, a bit-precise integer type, or an enumerated type, and they can be the same. *result shall be a modifiable lvalue of any integer type other than "plain" char, bool, a bit-precise integer type, or an enumerated type.

It is recommended to produce a diagnostic message if type2 or type3 are not suitable integer types, or if *result is not a modifiable lvalue of a suitable integer type.
