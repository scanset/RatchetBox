Defined in header <threads.h>

int mtx_unlock( mtx_t *mutex );

(since C11)

Unlocks the mutex pointed to by mutex. 

The behavior is undefined if the mutex is not locked by the calling thread.

This function synchronizes-with subsequent mtx_lock, mtx_trylock, or mtx_timedlock on the same mutex. All lock/unlock operations on any given mutex form a single total order (similar to the modification order of an atomic).

### Parameters

mutex

-

pointer to the mutex to unlock

### Return value

thrd_success if successful, thrd_error otherwise.
