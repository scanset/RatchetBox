Defined in header <threads.h>

int cnd_timedwait( cnd_t* restrict cond, mtx_t* restrict mutex,

                   const struct timespec* restrict time_point );

(since C11)

Atomically unlocks the mutex pointed to by mutex and blocks on the condition variable pointed to by cond until the thread is signalled by cnd_signal or cnd_broadcast, or until the TIME_UTC based time point pointed to by time_point has been reached, or until a spurious wake-up occurs. The mutex is locked again before the function returns.

The behavior is undefined if the mutex is not already locked by the calling thread.

### Parameters

cond

-

pointer to the condition variable to block on

mutex

-

pointer to the mutex to unlock for the duration of the block

time_point

-

pointer to an object specifying timeout time to wait until

### Return value

thrd_success if successful, thrd_timedout if the timeout time has been reached before the mutex is locked, or thrd_error if an error occurred.
