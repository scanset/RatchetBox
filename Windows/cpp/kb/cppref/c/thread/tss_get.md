Defined in header <threads.h>

void *tss_get( tss_t tss_key );

(since C11)

Returns the value held in thread-specific storage for the current thread identified by tss_key. Different threads may get different values identified by the same key.

On thread startup (see thrd_create), the values associated with all TSS keys are NULL. Different value may be placed in the thread-specific storage with tss_set.

### Parameters

tss_key

-

thread-specific storage key, obtained from tss_create and not deleted by tss_delete

### Return value

The value on success, NULL on failure.
