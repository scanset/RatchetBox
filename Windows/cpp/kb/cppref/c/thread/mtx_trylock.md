Defined in header <threads.h>

int mtx_trylock( mtx_t *mutex );

(since C11)

Tries to lock the mutex pointed to by mutex without blocking. Returns immediately if the mutex is already locked.

Prior calls to mtx_unlock on the same mutex synchronize-with this operation (if this operation succeeds), and all lock/unlock operations on any given mutex form a single total order (similar to the modification order of an atomic)

### Parameters

mutex

-

pointer to the mutex to lock

### Return value

thrd_success if successful, thrd_busy if the mutex has already been locked or due to a spurious failure to acquire an available mutex, thrd_error if an error occurs.
