Defined in header <threads.h>

#define thread_local _Thread_local

(since C11) 
(removed in C23)

Convenience macro which can be used to specify that an object has thread-local storage duration.

### Notes

Since C23, thread_local is itself a keyword, which may also be a predefined macro, so <threads.h> no longer provides it.
