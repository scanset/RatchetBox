Defined in header <threads.h>

int cnd_wait( cnd_t* cond, mtx_t* mutex );

(since C11)

Atomically unlocks the mutex pointed to by mutex and blocks on the condition variable pointed to by cond until the thread is signalled by cnd_signal or cnd_broadcast, or until a spurious wake-up occurs. The mutex is locked again before the function returns.

The behavior is undefined if the mutex is not already locked by the calling thread.

### Parameters

cond

-

pointer to the condition variable to block on

mutex

-

pointer to the mutex to unlock for the duration of the block

### Return value

thrd_success if successful, thrd_error otherwise.
