struct mbstate_t;

(since C95)

The type mbstate_t is a trivial non-array type that can represent any of the conversion states that can occur in an implementation-defined set of supported multibyte character encoding rules. Zero-initialized value of mbstate_t represents the initial conversion state, although other values of mbstate_t may exist that also represent the initial conversion state.

Possible implementation of mbstate_t is a struct type holding an array representing the incomplete multibyte character, an integer counter indicating the number of bytes in the array that have been processed, and a representation of the current shift state.

The following functions should not be called from multiple threads without synchronization with the mbstate_t* argument of a null pointer due to possible data races: mbrlen, mbrtowc, mbsrtowcs, mbtowc, wcrtomb, wcsrtombs, wctomb.
