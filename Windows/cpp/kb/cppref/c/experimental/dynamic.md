Extensions to the C Library Part II: Dynamic Allocation Functions, ISO/IEC TR 24731-2:2010, defines the following new components for the C standard library:

__STDC_ALLOC_LIB__

integer constant of type long indicating conformance level 
(macro constant)

Defined in header <stdio.h> 

fmemopen

(dynamic memory TR)

opens a fixed-size memory buffer as an I/O stream 
(function)

open_memstreamopen_wmemstream

(dynamic memory TR)

opens a dynamically resized memory buffer as an I/O stream 
(function)

asprintfaswprintfvasprintfvaswprintf

(dynamic memory TR)

variants of sprintf etc that write to automatically-allocated buffer and return a pointer to it 
(function)

getlinegetwlinegetdelimgetwdelim

(dynamic memory TR)

read from a stream into an automatically resized buffer until delimiter/end of line 
(function)

Defined in header <string.h> 

strdup

(dynamic memory TR)

allocate a copy of a string 
(function)

strndup

(dynamic memory TR)

allocate a copy of a string up to specified size 
(function)

This library extension also introduces assignment-allocation character m for use with %s, %[, and %c conversion specifiers in fscanf and fwscanf family of functions.

### Notes

The functions fmemopen, open_memstream, open_wmemstream, getdelim, getline, strdup, strndup, and the extensions to fscanf are available in POSIX (ISO/IEC 9945:2003).

The functions asprintf and vasprintf are available in Linux Standard Base (ISO/IEC IS 23360:2006)
