Some keywords are deprecated and retained as alternative spellings for compatibility purposes. These can be used wherever the keyword can.

alignas (C23)

_Alignas (C11)(deprecated in C23)

alignof (C23)

_Alignof (C11)(deprecated in C23)

bool (C23)

_Bool (C99)(deprecated in C23)

static_assert (C23)

_Static_assert (C11)(deprecated in C23)

thread_local (C23)

_Thread_local (C11)(deprecated in C23)

It is unspecified whether any of the spellings of these keywords, their alternate forms, or true and false is implemented as a predefined macro.

Each name that begins with a double underscore __ or an underscore _ followed by an uppercase letter is reserved: see identifier for details.

Note that digraphs <%, %>, <:, :>, %:, and %:%: provide an alternative way to represent standard tokens.

The following tokens are recognized by the preprocessor when they are used within the context of a preprocessor directive:

if

elif

else

endif

ifdef

ifndef

elifdef (C23)

elifndef (C23)

define

undef

include

embed (C23)

line

error

warning (C23)

pragma

defined

__has_include (C23)

__has_embed (C23)

__has_c_attribute (C23)

The following tokens are recognized by the preprocessor when they are used outside the context of a preprocessor directive:

_Pragma (C99)

The following additional keywords are classified as extensions and conditionally-supported:

asm

fortran
