Defined in header <stdlib.h>

void exit( int exit_code );

(until C11)

_Noreturn void exit( int exit_code );

(since C11) 
(until C23)

[[noreturn]] void exit( int exit_code );

(since C23)

Causes normal program termination to occur.

Several cleanup steps are performed:

- functions passed to atexit are called, in reverse order of registration

- all C streams are flushed and closed

- files created by tmpfile are removed

- control is returned to the host environment. If exit_code is zero or EXIT_SUCCESS, an implementation-defined status indicating successful termination is returned. If exit_code is EXIT_FAILURE, an implementation-defined status indicating unsuccessful termination is returned. In other cases implementation-defined status value is returned.

### Notes

The functions registered with at_quick_exit are not called.

The behavior is undefined if a program calls exit more than once, or if it calls exit and quick_exit

The behavior is undefined if during a call to a function registered with atexit, the function exits with longjmp.

Returning from the the main function, either by a return statement or by reaching the end of the function, executes exit(), passing the argument of the return statement (or ​0​ if implicit return was used) as exit_code.

### Parameters

exit_code

-

exit status of the program

### Return value

(none)

### Example

Run this code

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
 
int main(void)
{
FILE *fp = fopen("data.txt","r");
if (fp == NULL)
{
fprintf(stderr, "error opening file data.txt in function main()\n");
exit( EXIT_FAILURE );
}
fclose(fp);
printf("Normal Return\n");
return EXIT_SUCCESS ;
}

Possible output:

error opening file data.txt in function main()
