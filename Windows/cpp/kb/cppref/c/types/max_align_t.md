Defined in header <stddef.h>

typedef /*implementation-defined*/ max_align_t;

(since C11)

max_align_t is a type whose alignment requirement is at least as strict (as large) as that of every scalar type.

### Notes

Pointers returned by allocation functions such as malloc are suitably aligned for any object, which means they are aligned at least as strictly as max_align_t.

### Example

Run this code

#include <inttypes.h>
#include <stdalign.h>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
 
int main(void)
{
size_t a = alignof(max_align_t);
printf("Alignment of max_align_t is %zu (%#zx)\n", a, a);
 
void *p = malloc(123);
printf("The address obtained from malloc(123) is %#" PRIxPTR"\n",
(uintptr_t)p);
free(p);
}

Possible output:

Alignment of max_align_t is 16 (0x10)
The address obtained from malloc(123) is 0x1fa67010
