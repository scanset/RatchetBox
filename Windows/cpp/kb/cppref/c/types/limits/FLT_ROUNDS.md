Explanation

-1

the default rounding direction is not known

0

toward zero; same meaning as FE_TOWARDZERO

1

to nearest; same meaning as FE_TONEAREST

2

towards positive infinity; same meaning as FE_UPWARD

3

towards negative infinity; same meaning as FE_DOWNWARD

other values

implementation-defined behavior

### Notes

The rounding mode can be changed with fesetround and FLT_ROUNDS reflects that change.
