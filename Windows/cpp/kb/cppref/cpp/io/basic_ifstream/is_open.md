bool is_open() const;

Checks if the file stream has an associated file.

Effectively calls rdbuf()->is_open(). 

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if the file stream has an associated file, false otherwise.

### Example

Run this code

#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
// this file is called main.cpp
 
bool file_exists(const std::string& str)
{
std::ifstream fs(str);
return fs.is_open();
}
 
int main()
{
std::boolalpha(std::cout);
std::cout << file_exists("main.cpp") << '\n'
<< file_exists("strange_file") << '\n';
}

Possible output:

true
false
