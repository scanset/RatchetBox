Constructs new file stream.

1) Default constructor: constructs a stream that is not associated with a file: default-constructs the std::basic_filebuf and constructs the base with the pointer to this default-constructed std::basic_filebuf member.

2,3) First, performs the same steps as the default constructor, then associates the stream with a file by calling rdbuf()->open(filename, mode | std::ios_base::in) (see std::basic_filebuf::open for the details on the effects of that call). If the open() call returns a null pointer, sets setstate(failbit). Overload (3) is only provided if std::filesystem::path::value_type is not char.(since C++17)

4,5) Same as basic_ifstream(filename.c_str(), mode). (5) participates in overload resolution only if FsPath is std::filesystem::path.(since C++17) 

6) Move constructor. First, move-constructs the base class from other (which does not affect the rdbuf() pointer), then move-constructs the std::basic_filebuf member, then calls this->set_rdbuf() to install the new basic_filebuf as the rdbuf() pointer in the base class.

7) The copy-constructor is deleted: this class is not copyable.

### Parameters

filename

-

the name of the file to be opened

mode

-

specifies stream open mode. Following constants and bit-wise OR between them may be used:

Constant

Explanation

app

seek to the end of stream before each write

binary

open in binary mode

in

open for reading

out

open for writing

trunc

discard the contents of the stream when opening

ate

seek to the end of stream immediately after open

noreplace (C++23)

open in exclusive mode

other

-

another file stream to use as source

### Example

Run this code

#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <utility>
 
int main()
{
std::ifstream f0;
std::ifstream f1("test.bin", std::ios::binary);
std::string name = "example.txt";
std::ifstream f2(name);
std::ifstream f3(std::move(f1));
}
