void open( const char* filename,

           std::ios_base::openmode mode

= std::ios_base::in );

(1)

void open( const std::filesystem::path::value_type* filename,

           std::ios_base::openmode mode

= std::ios_base::in );

(2)
(since C++17)

void open( const std::string& filename,

           std::ios_base::openmode mode

= std::ios_base::in );

(3)
(since C++11)

void open( const std::filesystem::path& filename,

           std::ios_base::openmode mode

= std::ios_base::in );

(4)
(since C++17)

Opens and associates the file with name filename with the file stream.

Calls clear() on success. Calls setstate(failbit) on failure.

1,2) Effectively calls rdbuf()->open(filename, mode | ios_base::in) (see std::basic_filebuf::open for the details on the effects of that call). Overload (2) is only provided if std::filesystem::path::value_type is not char.(since C++17)

3,4) Effectively calls (1,2) as if by open(filename.c_str(), mode). 

### Parameters

filename

-

the name of the file to be opened

mode

-

specifies stream open mode. It is a BitmaskType, the following constants are defined:

Constant

Explanation

app

seek to the end of stream before each write

binary

open in binary mode

in

open for reading

out

open for writing

trunc

discard the contents of the stream when opening

ate

seek to the end of stream immediately after open

noreplace (C++23)

open in exclusive mode

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

LWG 22

C++98

it was unclear how error state changes upon a successful open

the error state is unchanged

LWG 409

C++98

the error state was unchanged upon a successful open

it is cleared[1]

- ↑ The resolution of LWG issue #22 is overriden.
