private:

ios_base( const ios_base& );

(until C++11)

public:

ios_base( const ios_base& ) = delete;

(since C++11)

protected:

ios_base();

(2)

1) The copy constructor is private(until C++11)deleted(since C++11): streams are not copyable.

2) The default constructor is protected: only derived classes may construct std::ios_base. The internal state is undefined after the construction. The derived class must call std::basic_ios::init() to complete initialization before first use or before destructor; otherwise the behavior is undefined.

### Notes

The same applies to the constructors of the next class in the I/O hierarchy, std::basic_ios. Further-derived classes (std::istream and std::ostream) are always constructed with a concrete stream buffer object and call std::basic_ios::init(), possibly more than once, to complete initialization of their virtual base.

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

the behavior of destroying a std::ios_base

initialization did not need to be completed before first use

also needs to be completed
