virtual ~basic_ostream();

Destroys the basic_ostream object. This destructor does not perform any operation on the underlying streambuffer (rdbuf()): the destructors of the derived output streams such as std::basic_ofstream and std::basic_ostringstream are responsible for calling the destructors of the stream buffers.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
 
void add_words(std::streambuf* p)
{
std::ostream buf(p); // buf shares the buffer with s
buf << " is the answer";
} // calls the destructor of buf. p remains unaffected
 
int main()
{
std::ostringstream s;
s << 42;
add_words(s.rdbuf());
s << ".";
std::cout << s.str() << '\n';
}

Output:

42 is the answer.
