basic_ostream& seekp( pos_type pos );

(1)

basic_ostream& seekp( off_type off, std::ios_base::seekdir dir );

(2)

Sets the output position indicator of the current associated streambuf object. 

Behaves as UnformattedOutputFunction (except without actually performing output). After constructing and checking the sentry object, 

(since C++11)

1) if fail() != true, sets the output position indicator to absolute (relative to the beginning of the file) value pos by calling rdbuf()->pubseekpos(pos, std::ios_base::out). In case of failure, calls setstate(std::ios_base::failbit).

2) if fail() != true, sets the output position indicator to offset off relative to dir by calling rdbuf()->pubseekoff(off, dir, std::ios_base::out). In case of failure, calls setstate(std::ios_base::failbit).

### Parameters

pos

-

absolute position to set the output position indicator to

off

-

relative position (positive or negative) to set the output position indicator to

dir

-

defines base position to apply the relative offset to. It can be one of the following constants:

Constant

Explanation

beg

the beginning of a stream

end

the ending of a stream

cur

the current position of stream position indicator

### Return value

*this

### Exceptions

1,2) May throw std::ios_base::failure in case of failure, if exceptions() & failbit != 0.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
std::ostringstream os("hello, world");
os.seekp(7);
os << 'W';
os.seekp(0, std::ios_base::end);
os << '!';
os.seekp(0);
os << 'H';
std::cout << os.str() << '\n';
}

Output:

Hello, World!

Correct behavior

LWG 129

C++98

there was no way to indicate a failure

sets failbit on failure

LWG 136

C++98

seekp could set the input stream

only sets the output stream

LWG 537

C++98

1. the type of pos was pos_type&
2. the type of off was off_type&

1. corrected to pos_type
2. corrected to off_type

LWG 2341

C++98

the resolution of LWG issue 129 for overload (2) was removed

restored
