State state() const;

(1)

void state( State st );

(2)

Manages the file position state.

1) Returns the value of the file position state.

2) Replaces the file position state with the value of st.

For the specializations of std::fpos that are used in the standard library, State is always std::mbstate_t.

### Parameters

st

-

new value for the state

### Return value

1) The current value of the fpos state.

2) (none)

### Example

Run this code

#include <cwchar>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
std::istringstream s("test");
std::mbstate_t st = s.tellg().state();
 
if (std::mbsinit(&st))
std::cout << "The stream is in the initial shift state\n";
}

Output:

The stream is in the initial shift state
