protected:

std::basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits>* setbuf( CharT *s, std::streamsize n ) override;

(since C++23)

Makes the basic_spanbuf perform I/O on the buffer [s, s + n). Equivalently calls this->span(std::span<CharT>(s, n)) and then returns this.

This function is protected virtual, it may only be called through pubsetbuf() or from member functions of a user-defined class derived from std::basic_spanbuf.

### Parameters

s

-

pointer to the first CharT in the user-provided buffer

n

-

the number of CharT elements in the user-provided buffer

### Return value

this

### Notes

The deprecated stream buffer std::strstreambuf or the boost.IOStreams device boost::basic_array can also implement I/O buffering over a user-provided char array.
