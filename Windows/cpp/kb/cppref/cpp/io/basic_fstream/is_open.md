bool is_open() const;

Checks if the file stream has an associated file.

Effectively calls rdbuf()->is_open(). 

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if the file stream has an associated file, false otherwise.

### Example

Run this code

#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::string filename = "some_file";
 
std::fstream fs(filename, std::ios::in);
 
std::cout << std::boolalpha;
std::cout << "fs.is_open() = " << fs.is_open() << '\n';
 
if (!fs.is_open())
{
fs.clear();
fs.open(filename, std::ios::out);
std::cout << "fs.is_open() = " << fs.is_open() << '\n';
}
}

Possible output:

fs.is_open() = false
fs.is_open() = true
