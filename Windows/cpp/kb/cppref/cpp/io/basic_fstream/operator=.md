basic_fstream& operator=( basic_fstream&& other );

(since C++11)

Move assigns the file stream other to *this, effectively move-assigning both the std::basic_iostream base class and the associated std::basic_filebuf.

other is left with no associated file. Note that the base class move assignment swaps all stream state variables (except for rdbuf) between *this and other.
