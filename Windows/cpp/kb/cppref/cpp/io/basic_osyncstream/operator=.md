basic_osyncstream& operator=( std::basic_osyncstream&& other );

(since C++20)

Move-assigns a synchronized output stream:

Move-assigns the wrapped std::basic_syncbuf from the corresponding member of other (after this move-assignment, other.get_wrapped() returns a null pointer and destruction of other produces no output; any pending buffered output will be emitted) and move-assigns the base std::basic_ostream (this swaps all stream state variables except for rdbuf between *this and other)

### Parameters

other

-

another synchronized output stream to move from

### Return value

*this

### Example

Run this code

#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <syncstream>
#include <utility>
 
int main()
{
std::osyncstream out(std::cout);
out << "test\n";
std::ostringstream str_out;
std::osyncstream{str_out} = std::move(out); // Note that out is emitted here
std::cout << "str_out = " << std::quoted(str_out.view()) << '\n';
}

Output:

test
str_out = ""
