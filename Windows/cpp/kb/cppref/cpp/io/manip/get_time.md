/*unspecified*/ get_time( std::tm* tmb, const CharT* fmt );

(since C++11)

When used in an expression in >> get_time(tmb, fmt), parses the character input as a date/time value according to format string fmt according to the std::time_get facet of the locale currently imbued in the input stream in. The resultant value is stored in a std::tm object pointed to by tmb.

### Parameters

tmb

-

valid pointer to the std::tm object where the result will be stored

fmt

-

pointer to a null-terminated CharT string specifying the conversion format
The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers, whitespace characters, and ordinary characters (except %). Each ordinary character is expected to match one character in the input stream in case-insensitive comparison. Each whitespace character matches arbitrary whitespace in the input string. Each conversion specification begins with % character, optionally followed by E or O modifier (ignored if unsupported by the locale), followed by the character that determines the behavior of the specifier. The format specifiers match the POSIX function strptime():

### Return value

An object of unspecified type such that

- if in is an object of type std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>, the expression in >> get_time(tmb, fmt)
has type std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>&

- has value in

- behaves as if it called f(in, tmb, fmt)

where the function f is defined as:

template<class CharT, class Traits>
void f(std::basic_ios<CharT, Traits>& str, std::tm* tmb, const CharT* fmt)
{
using Iter = std::istreambuf_iterator<CharT, Traits>;
using TimeGet = time_get<CharT, Iter>;
 
std::ios_base::iostate err = std::ios_base::goodbit;
const TimeGet& tg = std::use_facet<TimeGet>(str.getloc());
 
tg.get(Iter(str.rdbuf()), Iter(), str, err, tmb,
fmt, fmt + Traits::length(fmt));
 
if (err != std::ios_base::goodbit)
str.setstate(err);
}

### Notes

As specified in std::time_get::do_get, which this function calls, it's unspecified if this function zero out the fields in *tmb that are not set directly by the conversion specifiers that appear in fmt: portable programs should initialize every field of *tmb to zero before calling std::get_time.

### Example

Note: choose clang or gcc >= 12.1 to observe the output. libstdc++ before 12.1 does not correctly implement the %b specifier: bug #78714.

Run this code

#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
std::tm t = {};
std::istringstream ss("2011-Februar-18 23:12:34");
ss.imbue(std::locale("de_DE.utf-8"));
ss >> std::get_time(&t, "%Y-%b-%d %H:%M:%S");
 
if (ss.fail())
std::cout << "Parse failed\n";
else
std::cout << std::put_time(&t, "%c") << '\n';
}

Possible output:

Sun Feb 18 23:12:34 2011
