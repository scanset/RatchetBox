Defined in header <ostream>

template< class CharT, class Traits >

std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& flush_emit( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os );

(since C++20)

Flushes the output sequence os as if by calling os.flush(). Then, if os.rdbuf() actually points to a std::basic_syncbuf<CharT, Traits, Allocator> buf, calls buf.emit().

This is an output-only I/O manipulator, it may be called with an expression such as out << std::flush_emit for any out of type std::basic_ostream.

### Parameters
