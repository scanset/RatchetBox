Defined in header <ostream>

template< class CharT, class Traits >

std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& ends( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os );

Inserts a null character into the output sequence os as if by calling os.put(CharT()). 

This is an output-only I/O manipulator, it may be called with an expression such as out << std::ends for any out of type std::basic_ostream.

### Notes

This manipulator is typically used with std::ostrstream, when the associated output buffer needs to be null-terminated to be processed as a C string.

Unlike std::endl, this manipulator does not flush the stream.

### Parameters

os

-

reference to output stream

### Return value

os (reference to the stream after insertion of the null character).

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstdio>
#include <strstream>
 
int main()
{
std::ostrstream oss;
oss << "Sample text: " << 42 << std::ends;
std::printf("%s\n", oss.str());
oss.freeze(false); // enable memory deallocation
}

Output:

Sample text: 42
