basic_spanstream& operator=( basic_spanstream&& other );

(1)
(since C++23)

basic_spanstream& operator=( const basic_spanstream& ) = delete;

(2)
(since C++23)

1) Move assigns the other to *this, effectively move-assigning both the std::basic_iostream base class subobject and the wrapped std::basic_spanbuf.

2) Copy assignment operator is deleted. basic_spanstream is not copy assignable.

Note that move assignment operator of the base class swaps all stream state variables (except for rdbuf()) between *this and other.

It is implementation-defined whether the std::basic_spanbuf wrapped in other still holds an underlying buffer after the move assignment.

### Parameters

another stream to move from

*this
