int_type snextc();

Advances the input sequence by one character and reads one character.

The function calls sbumpc() to advance the input sequence. If that function returns Traits::eof() meaning that input sequence has been exhausted and uflow() could not retrieve more data, Traits::eof() is returned. Otherwise sgetc() is called in order to read the character.

### Parameters
