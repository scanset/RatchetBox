pos_type pubseekpos( pos_type pos,

                     std::ios_base::openmode which = std::ios_base::in | std::ios_base::out );

(1)

protected:

virtual pos_type seekpos( pos_type pos,

std::ios_base::openmode which = std::ios_base::in | std::ios_base::out );

(2)

Sets the position indicator of the input and/or output sequence to an absolute position.

1) Calls seekpos(pos, which) of the most derived class.

2) The base class version of this function has no effect. The derived classes may override this function to allow absolute positioning of the position indicator.

### Parameters

pos

-

absolute position to set the position indicator to

which

-

defines which of the input and/or output sequences to affect. It can be one or a combination of the following constants:

Constant

Explanation

in

affect the input sequence

out

affect the output sequence

### Return value

1) The return value of seekpos(pos, which).

2) The resulting absolute position as defined by the position indicator. The base class version returns pos_type(off_type(-1)).
