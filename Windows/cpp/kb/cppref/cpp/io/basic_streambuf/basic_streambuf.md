protected:

basic_streambuf();

(1)

protected:

basic_streambuf(const basic_streambuf& rhs);

(2)
(since C++11)

1) Constructs the basic_streambuf object, initializes the six pointer members (eback(), gptr(), egptr(), pbase(), pptr(), and epptr()) to null pointer values, and the locale member to std::locale(), a copy of the global C++ locale at the time of construction.

2) Constructs a copy of rhs, initializing the six pointers and the locale object with the copies of the values held by rhs. Note that this is a shallow copy: the pointers of the newly-constructed basic_streambuf are pointing into the same character array as the pointers of rhs.

Both constructors are protected, and are only called by the concrete streambuf classes, such as std::basic_filebuf, std::basic_stringbuf, or std::strstreambuf.

### Parameters

rhs

-

a streambuf object to copy

### Notes

Until C++11, it was unspecified whether basic_streambuf or any of its derived classes is CopyConstructible (LWG issue 421), and different C++ library implementations provided different options.
