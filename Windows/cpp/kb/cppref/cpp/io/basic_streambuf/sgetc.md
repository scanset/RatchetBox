int_type sgetc();

Reads one character from the input sequence.

If the input sequence read position is not available, returns underflow(). Otherwise returns Traits::to_int_type(*gptr()).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The value of the character pointed to by the get pointer.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
std::stringstream stream("Hello, world");
std::cout << "sgetc() returned '" << (char)stream.rdbuf()->sgetc() << "'\n";
std::cout << "peek() returned '" << (char)stream.peek() << "'\n";
std::cout << "get() returned '" << (char)stream.get() << "'\n";
}

Output:

sgetc() returned 'H'
peek() returned 'H'
get() returned 'H'
