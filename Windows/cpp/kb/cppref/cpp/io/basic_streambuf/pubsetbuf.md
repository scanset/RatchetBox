basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits>* pubsetbuf( char_type* s, std::streamsize n )

(1)

protected:

virtual basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits>* setbuf( char_type* s, std::streamsize n )

(2)

1) Calls setbuf(s, n) of the most derived class.

2) The base class version of this function has no effect. The derived classes may override this function to allow removal or replacement of the controlled character sequence (the buffer) with a user-provided array, or for any other implementation-specific purpose.

### Parameters

s

-

pointer to the first CharT in the user-provided buffer

n

-

the number of CharT elements in the user-provided buffer

### Return value

1) The return value of setbuf(s, n).

2) this

### Example

Provides a 10k buffer for reading. On linux, the strace utility may be used to observe the actual number of bytes read.

Run this code

#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
int cnt = 0;
std::ifstream file;
char buf[1024 * 10 + 1];
 
file.rdbuf()->pubsetbuf(buf, sizeof buf);
 
file.open("/usr/share/dict/words");
 
for (std::string line; getline(file, line);)
++cnt;
 
std::cout << cnt << '\n';
}

Possible output:

356010
