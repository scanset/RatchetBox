Defined in header <cstdio>

char* gets( char* str );

(deprecated in C++11) 
(removed in C++14)

Reads stdin into given character string until a newline character is found or end-of-file occurs.

### Parameters

str

-

character string to be written

### Return value

str on success, a null pointer on failure.

If the failure has been caused by end of file condition, additionally sets the eof indicator (see std::feof()) on stdin. If the failure has been caused by some other error, sets the error indicator (see std::ferror()) on stdin.

### Notes

The std::gets() function does not perform bounds checking. Therefore, this function is extremely vulnerable to buffer-overflow attacks. It cannot be used safely (unless the program runs in an environment which restricts what can appear on stdin). For this reason, the function was deprecated in C++11 and removed altogether in C++14. std::fgets() may be used instead.

### Example

Run this code

#include <array>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
 
int main()
{
std::puts("Never use std::gets(). Use std::fgets() instead!");
 
std::array<char, 16> buf;
 
std::printf("Enter a string:\n>");
 
if (std::fgets(buf.data(), buf.size(), stdin))
{
const auto len = std::strlen(buf.data());
std::printf(
"The input string:\n[%s] is %s and has the length %li characters.\n",
buf.data(), len + 1 < buf.size() ? "not truncated" : "truncated", len
);
}
else if (std::feof(stdin))
{
std::puts("Error: the end of stdin stream has been reached.");
}
else if (std::ferror(stdin))
{
std::puts("I/O error when reading from stdin.");
}
else
{
std::puts("Unknown stdin error.");
}
}

Possible output:

Never use std::gets(). Use std::fgets() instead!
Enter a string:
>Living on Earth is expensive, but it does include a free trip around the Sun.
The input string:
[Living on Earth] is truncated and has the length 15 characters.
