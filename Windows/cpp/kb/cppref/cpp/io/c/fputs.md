Defined in header <cstdio>

int fputs( const char* str, std::FILE* stream );

Writes every character from the null-terminated string str to the output stream stream, as if by repeatedly executing std::fputc.

The terminating null character from str is not written.

### Parameters

str

-

null-terminated character string to be written

stream

-

output stream

### Return value

On success, returns a non-negative value

On failure, returns EOF and sets the error indicator (see std::ferror) on stream.

### Notes

The related function std::puts appends a newline character to the output, while std::fputs writes the string unmodified.

Different implementations return different non-negative numbers: some return the last character written, some return the number of characters written (or INT_MAX if the string was longer than that), some simply return a non-negative constant such as zero.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstdio>
 
int main(void)
{
int rc = std::fputs("Hello World", stdout);
 
if (rc == EOF)
std::perror("fputs()"); // POSIX requires that errno is set
}

Output:

Hello World
