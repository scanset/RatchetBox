Defined in header <cstdio>

int fgetc( std::FILE* stream );

int getc( std::FILE* stream );

Reads the next character from the given input stream.

### Parameters

stream

-

to read the character from

### Return value

The obtained character on success or EOF on failure.

If the failure has been caused by end of file condition, additionally sets the eof indicator (see std::feof()) on stream. If the failure has been caused by some other error, sets the error indicator (see std::ferror()) on stream.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
 
int main()
{
int is_ok = EXIT_FAILURE;
FILE* fp = std::fopen("/tmp/test.txt", "w+");
if (!fp)
{
std::perror("File opening failed");
return is_ok;
}
 
int c; // Note: int, not char, required to handle EOF
while ((c = std::fgetc(fp)) != EOF) // Standard C I/O file reading loop
std::putchar(c);
 
if (std::ferror(fp))
std::puts("I/O error when reading");
else if (std::feof(fp))
{
std::puts("End of file reached successfully");
is_ok = EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
 
std::fclose(fp);
return is_ok;
}

Output:

End of file reached successfully
