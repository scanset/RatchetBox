Defined in header <cstdio>

int feof( std::FILE* stream );

Checks if the end of the given file stream has been reached.

### Parameters

stream

-

the file stream to check

### Return value

Nonzero value if the end of the stream has been reached, otherwise ​0​.

### Notes

This function only reports the stream state as reported by the most recent I/O operation, it does not examine the associated data source. For example, if the most recent I/O was a std::fgetc, which returned the last byte of a file, std::feof returns zero. The next std::fgetc fails and changes the stream state to end-of-file. Only then std::feof returns non-zero.

In typical usage, input stream processing stops on any error; feof and std::ferror are then used to distinguish between different error conditions.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
 
int main()
{
int is_ok = EXIT_FAILURE;
FILE* fp = std::fopen("/tmp/test.txt", "w+");
if (!fp)
{
std::perror("File opening failed");
return is_ok;
}
 
int c; // Note: int, not char, required to handle EOF
while ((c = std::fgetc(fp)) != EOF) // Standard C I/O file reading loop
std::putchar(c);
 
if (std::ferror(fp))
std::puts("I/O error when reading");
else if (std::feof(fp))
{
std::puts("End of file reached successfully");
is_ok = EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
 
std::fclose(fp);
return is_ok;
}

Output:

End of file reached successfully
