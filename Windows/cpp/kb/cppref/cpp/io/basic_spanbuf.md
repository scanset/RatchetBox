(since C++23)

std::basic_spanbuf is a std::basic_streambuf whose associated character sequence is a memory-resident sequence of arbitrary characters, which can be initialized from or made available as an instance of std::span<CharT>.

std::basic_spanbuf performs I/O on a fixed buffer, and therefore it does not attempt to obtain a new buffer when the underlying buffer is exhausted.

Several typedefs for common character types are provided:

### Notes

std::basic_spanbuf does not own the underlying buffer.

It is the responsibility of programmers to ensure the underlying buffer is in its lifetime when used by a std::basic_spanbuf object. Additional synchronization may be needed if more than one thread operates the same underlying buffer through different std::basic_spanbuf objects.
