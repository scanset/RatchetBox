virtual ~basic_iostream();

Destructs the input/output stream.

### Notes

This destructor does not perform any operation on the underlying stream buffer (rdbuf()): the destructors of the derived streams such as std::basic_fstream and std::basic_stringstream are responsible for calling the destructors of the stream buffers.
