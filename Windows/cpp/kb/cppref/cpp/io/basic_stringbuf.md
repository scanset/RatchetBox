: public std::basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits>

std::basic_stringbuf is a std::basic_streambuf whose associated character sequence is a memory-resident sequence of arbitrary characters, which can be initialized from or made available as an instance of std::basic_string.

Typical implementations of std::basic_stringbuf hold an object of type std::basic_string or equivalent resizable sequence container directly as a data member and use it as both the controlled character sequence (the array where the six pointers of std::basic_streambuf are pointing to) and as the associated character sequence (the source of characters for all input operations and the target for the output).

In addition, a typical implementation holds a data member of type std::ios_base::openmode to indicate the I/O mode of the associated stream (input-only, output-only, input/output, at-end, etc).

If over-allocation strategy is used by overflow(), an additional high-watermark pointer may be stored to track the last initialized character.

(since C++11)

Several typedefs for common character types are provided:
