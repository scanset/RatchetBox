std::streamsize gcount() const;

Returns the number of characters extracted by the last unformatted input operation, or the maximum representable value of std::streamsize if the number is not representable.

The following member functions of basic_istream change the value of subsequent gcount() calls:

- move constructor

- swap()

- get()

- getline()

- ignore()

- read()

- readsome()

- operator>>(basic_streambuf*)

The following functions set gcount() to zero:

- constructor

- putback()

- unget()

- peek()

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The number of characters extracted by the last unformatted input operation, or the maximum representable value of std::streamsize if the number is not representable.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
char x[20];
std::istringstream stream("Hello World");
 
stream.read(x, sizeof x);
std::cout << "Characters extracted: " << stream.gcount();
}

Output:

Characters extracted: 11
