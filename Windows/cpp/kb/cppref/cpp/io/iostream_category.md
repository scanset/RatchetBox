Defined in header <ios>

const std::error_category& iostream_category() noexcept;

(since C++11)

Obtains a reference to the static error category object for iostream errors. The object is required to override the virtual function error_category::name() to return a pointer to the string "iostream". It is used to identify error codes provided in the exceptions of type std::ios_base::failure.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

A reference to the static object of unspecified runtime type, derived from std::error_category.

### Example

Run this code

#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::ifstream f("doesn't exist");
try
{
f.exceptions(f.failbit);
}
catch (const std::ios_base::failure& e)
{
std::cout << "Caught an ios_base::failure.\n"
<< "Error code: " << e.code().value() 
<< " (" << e.code().message() << ")\n"
<< "Error category: " << e.code().category().name() << '\n';
 
}
}

Possible output:

Caught an ios_base::failure.
Error code: 1 (unspecified iostream_category error)
Error category: iostream
