void swap( basic_stringbuf& rhs );

(since C++11) 
(until C++20)

void swap( basic_stringbuf& rhs ) noexcept(/* see below */);

(since C++20)

Swaps the state and the contents of *this and rhs.

The behavior is undefined if Allocator does not propagate on swap and the allocators of *this and other are unequal.

(since C++11)

### Parameters

rhs

-

another basic_stringbuf

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

(since C++11)
(until C++20)

noexcept specification:  
noexcept(std::allocator_traits<Allocator>::propagate_on_container_swap::value

std::allocator_traits<Allocator>::is_always_equal::value)

(since C++20)

### Notes

This function is called automatically when swapping std::stringstream objects. It is rarely necessary to call it directly.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::istringstream one("one");
std::ostringstream two("two");
 
std::cout << "Before swap: one = " << std::quoted(one.str())
<< ", two = " << std::quoted(two.str()) << ".\n";
 
one.rdbuf()->swap(*two.rdbuf());
 
std::cout << "After swap: one = " << std::quoted(one.str())
<< ", two = " << std::quoted(two.str()) << ".\n";
}

Output:

Before swap: one = "one", two = "two".
After swap: one = "two", two = "one".
