void init_buf_ptrs();

(exposition only*)

Initializes the input and output sequences from buf according to mode. buf and mode are exposition-only data members of *this.

Immediately after this function returns:

- If std::ios_base::out is set in mode, pbase() points to buf.front() and epptr() >= pbase() + buf.size() is true;
in addition, if std::ios_base::ate is set in mode, pptr() == pbase() + buf.size() is true,

- otherwise pptr() == pbase() is true.

- If std::ios_base::in is set in mode, eback() points to buf.front(), and gptr() == eback() && egptr() == eback() + buf.size() is true.

### Notes

For efficiency reasons, stream buffer operations can violate invariants of buf while it is held encapsulated in the std::basic_stringbuf, e.g., by writing to characters in the range [buf.data() + buf.size(), buf.data() + buf.capacity()).

All operations retrieving a std::basic_string from buf ensure that the std::basic_string invariants hold on the returned value.
