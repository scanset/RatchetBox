protected:

virtual pos_type seekpos( pos_type sp,

std::ios_base::openmode which = std::ios_base::in | std::ios_base::out );

Repositions std::basic_streambuf::gptr and/or std::basic_streambuf::pptr, if possible, to the position indicated by sp.

Effectively executes seekoff(off_type(sp), std::ios_base::beg, which).

### Parameters

sp

-

stream position, such as one obtained by seekoff() or seekpos()

which

-

defines whether the input sequences, the output sequence, or both are affected. It can be one or a combination of the following constants:

Constant

Explanation

in

affect the input sequence

out

affect the output sequence

### Return value

sp on success or pos_type(off_type(-1)) on failure.

### Notes

seekpos() is called by std::basic_streambuf::pubseekpos(), which is called by the single-argument versions of std::basic_istream::seekg() and std::basic_ostream::seekp().

### Example

Run this code

#include <sstream>
#include <iostream>
 
struct mybuf : std::stringbuf
{
mybuf(const std::string& str) : std::stringbuf(str) {}
 
pos_type seekpos(pos_type sp, std::ios_base::openmode which)
{
std::cout << "Before seekpos(" << sp << "), size of the get area is "
<< egptr() - eback() << " with "
<< egptr() - gptr() << " read positions available.\n";
 
pos_type rc = std::stringbuf::seekpos(sp, which);
 
std::cout << "seekpos() returns " << rc << ".\nAfter the call, "
<< "size of the get area is "
<< egptr() - eback() << " with "
<< egptr() - gptr() << " read positions available.\n";
 
return rc;
}
};
 
int main()
{
mybuf buf("12345");
std::iostream stream(&buf);
stream.seekg(2);
}

Output:

Before seekpos(2), size of the get area is 5 with 5 read positions available.
seekpos() returns 2.
After the call, size of the get area is 5 with 3 read positions available.
