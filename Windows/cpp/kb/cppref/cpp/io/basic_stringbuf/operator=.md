std::basic_stringbuf& operator=( std::basic_stringbuf&& rhs );

(1)
(since C++11)

std::basic_stringbuf& operator=( const std::basic_stringbuf& rhs ) = delete;

(2)

1) Move assignment operator: Moves the contents of rhs into *this. After the move, *this has the associated string, the open mode, the locale, and all other state formerly held by rhs. The six pointers of std::basic_streambuf in *this are guaranteed to be different from the corresponding pointers in the moved-from rhs unless null.

2) The copy assignment operator is deleted; basic_stringbuf is not CopyAssignable.

### Parameters

rhs

-

another basic_stringbuf that will be moved from

### Return value

*this

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::istringstream one("one");
std::ostringstream two("two");
 
std::cout << "Before move, one = \"" << one.str() << '"'
<< " two = \"" << two.str() << "\"\n";
 
*one.rdbuf() = std::move(*two.rdbuf());
 
std::cout << "After move, one = \"" << one.str() << '"'
<< " two = \"" << two.str() << "\"\n";
}

Output:

Before move, one = "one" two = "two"
After move, one = "two" two = ""
