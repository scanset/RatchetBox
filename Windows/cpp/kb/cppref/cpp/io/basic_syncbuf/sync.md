protected:

int sync() override;

First, records that a flush is pending, by updating the appropriate private flag.

Then, if the current emit-on-sync policy is true, makes a call to emit().

Otherwise (if the emit-on-sync policy is false, which is the default), the flush is suspended until emit() is called, such as through std::basic_osyncstream::emit() or std::basic_osyncstream::~basic_osyncstream

### Parameters

(none)

### Notes

sync() or its equivalent is implicitly called by close(), seekoff(), and seekpos() and explicitly called by std::basic_streambuf::pubsync()

### Example

sync

[virtual]

synchronizes the buffers with the associated character sequence 
(virtual protected member function of std::basic_streambuf<CharT,Traits>)

emit

calls emit() on the underlying basic_syncbuf to transmit its internal data to the final destination 
(public member function of std::basic_osyncstream<CharT,Traits,Allocator>)
