bool emit();

Atomically transmits all pending output to the wrapped stream.

All emit() calls transferring characters to the same wrapped stream buffer object appear to execute in a total order, where each emit() call synchronizes-with subsequent emit() calls in that total order, even if these calls are made through difference instances of std::basic_syncbuf/std::basic_osyncstream. In practice, this means that emit() takes a lock uniquely associated with the wrapped stream object: for example, it could be held in a static hash map where the address of the wrapped stream is used as the key.

If a call had been made to sync since the last call to emit(), then also flushes the wrapped stream by calling pubsync() on it.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if all of the following is true:

- there is a wrapped stream (the wrapped streambuf pointer is not null)

- all characters from the temporary storage were successfully sent into the wrapped stream

- the call to pubsync(), if requested, also completed successfully.

Returns false otherwise.

### Notes

Normally called by the destructor or move assignment of the owning std::basic_osyncstream, or by std::basic_osyncstream::emit.
