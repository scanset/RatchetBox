strstream();

(1)
(deprecated in C++98) 
(removed in C++26)

strstream( char* s, int n, std::ios_base::openmode mode =

                               std::ios_base::in | std::ios_base::out );

(2)
(deprecated in C++98) 
(removed in C++26)

Constructs new input/output strstream and its underlying std::strstreambuf.

1) Default-constructs the underlying std::strstreambuf, which creates a dynamically growing buffer, and initializes the base class with the address of the strstreambuf member.

2) Initialized the base class with the address of the underlying std::strstreambuf member, which is initialized in one of the two possible ways, both of which use a user-provided fixed-size array:

a) if (mode & app) == 0 (the app bit is not set in mode), constructs the buffer by calling strstreambuf(s, n, s). The behavior is undefined if there are less than n elements in the array whose first element is pointed to by s.

b) if (mode & app) != 0 (the app bit is set in mode), constructs the buffer by calling strstreambuf(s, n, s + std::strlen(s)). The behavior is undefined if there are less than n elements in the array whose first element is pointed to by s or if the array does not contain a valid null-terminated character sequence.

### Parameters

s

-

char array to use as the output buffer

n

-

size of the array to be used for output

mode

-

specifies stream open mode. It is a bitmask type, the following constants are defined (although only app is used):

Constant

Explanation

app

seek to the end of stream before each write

binary

open in binary mode

in

open for reading

out

open for writing

trunc

discard the contents of the stream when opening

ate

seek to the end of stream immediately after open

noreplace (C++23)

open in exclusive mode

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <strstream>
 
int main()
{
// dynamic buffer
std::strstream s1;
s1 << 1 << ' ' << 3.14 << " example" << std::ends;
std::cout << "Buffer holds: '" << s1.str() << "'\n";
s1.freeze(false);
 
int n;
double d;
std::string w;
s1 >> n >> d >> w;
std::cout << "Read back: n = " << n
<< ", d = " << d
<< ", w = '" << w << "'\n";
 
// static buffer
char arr[20] = "-1 -3.14 ";
std::strstream s2(arr, sizeof arr, std::ios_base::app);
s2 << "another" << std::ends;
std::cout << "Buffer holds: '" << s2.str() << "'\n";
s2 >> n >> d >> w;
std::cout << "Read back: n = " << n
<< ", d = " << d
<< ", w = '" << w << "'\n";
}

Output:

Buffer holds: '1 3.14 example'
Read back: n = 1, d = 3.14, w = 'example'
Buffer holds: '-1 -3.14 another'
Read back: n = -1, d = -3.14, w = 'another'
