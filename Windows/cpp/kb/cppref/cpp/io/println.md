Defined in header <print>

template< class... Args >

void println( std::format_string<Args...> fmt, Args&&... args );

(1)
(since C++23)

template< class... Args >

void println( std::FILE* stream,

std::format_string<Args...> fmt, Args&&... args );

(2)
(since C++23)

void println();

(3)
(since C++26)

void println( std::FILE* stream );

(4)
(since C++26)

Format args according to the format string fmt with appended '\n' (which means that each output ends with a new-line), and print the result to a stream.

1) Equivalent to std::println(stdout, fmt, std::forward<Args>(args)...).

2) Equivalent to performing the following operations:

std::print(stream, "{}\n", std::format(fmt, std::forward<Args>(args)...));

(until C++26)

std::print(stream, std::runtime_format(std::string(fmt.get()) + '\n'),
           std::forward<Args>(args)...)

(since C++26)

3) Equivalent to std::println(stdout).

4) Equivalent to std::print(stream, "\n").

If std::formatter<Ti, char> does not meet the BasicFormatter requirements for any Ti in Args (as required by std::make_format_args), the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

stream

-

output file stream to write to

fmt

-

an object that represents the format string. The format string consists of

- ordinary characters (except { and }), which are copied unchanged to the output,

- escape sequences {{ and }}, which are replaced with { and } respectively in the output, and

- replacement fields.

Each replacement field has the following format:

{ arg-id (optional) }

(1)

{ arg-id (optional) : format-spec }

(2)

1) replacement field without a format specification

2) replacement field with a format specification

arg-id

-

specifies the index of the argument in args whose value is to be used for formatting; if it is omitted, the arguments are used in order.
The arg-id ﻿s in a format string must all be present or all be omitted. Mixing manual and automatic indexing is an error.

format-spec

-

the format specification defined by the std::formatter specialization for the corresponding argument. Cannot start with }.

- For basic types and standard string types, the format specification is interpreted as standard format specification.

- For chrono types, the format specification is interpreted as chrono format specification.

- For range types, the format specification is interpreted as range format specification.

- For std::pair and std::tuple, the format specification is interpreted as tuple format specification.

- For std::thread::id and std::stacktrace_entry, see thread id format specification and stacktrace entry format specification.

- For std::basic_stacktrace, no format specifier is allowed.

(since C++23)

- For std::filesystem::path, see path format specification.

(since C++26)

- For other formattable types, the format specification is determined by user-defined formatter specializations.

args...

-

arguments to be formatted

### Exceptions

- std::bad_alloc on allocation failure.

- std::system_error, if writing to the stream fails.

- Propagates any exception thrown by used formatters, e.g. std::format_error.

### Notes

Although overloads (3,4) are added in C++26, all known implementations make them available in C++23 mode.

Unbuffered formatted output[1]

Exposing std::basic_format_string

- ↑ Although P3107R5 is accepted as a DR, std::runtime_format is only avilable since C++26. As a result, the resolution cannot be applied in C++23.

### Example

Run this code

#include <print>
 
int main()
{
// Each call to std::println ends with new-line
std::println("Please"); // overload (1)
std::println("enter"); // (1)
 
std::print("pass");
std::print("word");
 
std::println(); // (3); valid since C++26; same effect as std::print("\n"); 
}
