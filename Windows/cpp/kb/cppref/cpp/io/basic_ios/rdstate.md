iostate rdstate() const;

Returns the current stream error state.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

current stream error state. It is a bitmask type and can be a combination of the following constants:

Constant

Explanation

goodbit

no error

badbit

irrecoverable stream error

failbit

input/output operation failed (formatting or extraction error)

eofbit

associated input sequence has reached end-of-file

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
std::ostringstream stream;
 
if (stream.rdstate() == std::ios_base::goodbit)
std::cout << "stream state is goodbit\n";
 
stream.setstate(std::ios_base::eofbit);
 
// check state is exactly eofbit (no failbit and no badbit)
if (stream.rdstate() == std::ios_base::eofbit)
std::cout << "stream state is eofbit\n";
}

Output:

stream state is goodbit
stream state is eofbit
