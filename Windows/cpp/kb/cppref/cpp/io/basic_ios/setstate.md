void setstate( iostate state );

Sets the stream error flags state in addition to currently set flags. Essentially calls clear(rdstate() | state). May throw an exception.

### Parameters

state

-

stream error state flags to set. It can be a combination of the following constants:

Constant

Explanation

goodbit

no error

badbit

irrecoverable stream error

failbit

input/output operation failed (formatting or extraction error)

eofbit

associated input sequence has reached end-of-file

### Return value

(none)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
std::ostringstream stream;
 
if (!stream.fail())
std::cout << "stream is not fail\n";
 
stream.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit);
 
if (stream.fail())
std::cout << "now stream is fail\n";
 
if (!stream.good())
std::cout << "and stream is not good\n";
}

Output:

stream is not fail
now stream is fail
and stream is not good
