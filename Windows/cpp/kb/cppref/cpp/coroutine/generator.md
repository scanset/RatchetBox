(2)
(since C++23)

1) The class template std::generator presents a view of the elements yielded by the evaluation of a coroutine.

2) Convenience alias template for the generator using the polymorphic allocator.

A std::generator generates a sequence of elements by repeatedly resuming the coroutine from which it was returned.
Each time a co_yield statement is evaluated, the coroutine produces one element of the sequence.
When the co_yield statement is of the form co_yield ranges::elements_of(rng), each element of the range rng is successively produced as an element of the sequence.

std::generator models view and input_range.

The behavior of a program that adds a specialization for std::generator is undefined.

### Template parameters

Ref

-

the reference type (ranges::range_reference_t) of the generator. If V is void, both the reference type and the value type are inferred from Ref

V

-

the value type (ranges::range_value_t) of the generator, or void

Allocator

-

an allocator type or void

If Allocator is not void, then the behavior is undefined if Allocator does not meet the Allocator requirements.

### Member types

Member

Definition

value (private)

std::conditional_t<std::is_void_v<V>, std::remove_cvref_t<Ref>, V>;
(exposition-only member type*)

reference (private)

std::conditional_t<std::is_void_v<V>, Ref&&, Ref>;
(exposition-only member type*)

yielded

std::conditional_t<std::is_reference_v<reference ﻿>, reference, const reference ﻿&>

Type requirements

-

std::allocator_traits<Allocator>::pointer is a pointer type.

-

value is a cv-unqualified object type.

-

reference is either a reference type, or a cv-unqualified object type that models copy_constructible.

-

Let RRef denote std::remove_reference_t<reference ﻿>&&, if reference is a reference type, and reference otherwise.

- std::common_reference_with<reference ﻿&&, value ﻿&> is modeled.

- std::common_reference_with<reference ﻿&&, RRef ﻿&&> is modeled.

- std::common_reference_with<RRef ﻿&&, const value ﻿&> is modeled.

The program is ill-formed if any of these type requirements is not satisfied.

### Data members

Member

Definition

active_ (private)

Internally, each active instance of std::generator is associated with a stack (handled as if by object of type std::unique_ptr<std::stack<std::coroutine_handle<>>>).

- When begin is called, a new stack is created and the generator is added to the stack.

- When co_yield ranges::elements_of(rng) is evaluated in a generator body, rng is converted to a generator and added to the stack that contains the enclosing generator.

- When a generator iterator is incremented, the coroutine at the top of the associated stack is resumed.

- When a generator finishes (i.e. when promise_type::final_suspend is called), it is removed from the stack.
(exposition-only member object*)

coroutine_ (private)

a handle of type std::coroutine_handle<promise_type>
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a generator object 
(public member function)

(destructor)

effectively destroys the entire stack of yielded generators 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns a generator object 
(public member function)

begin

resumes the initially suspended coroutine and returns an iterator to its handle 
(public member function)

end

returns std::default_sentinel 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Nested classes

promise_type

the promise type 
(public member class)

iterator

the iterator type
(exposition-only member class*)

### Example

Run this code

#include <generator>
#include <iostream>
 
template<typename T>
struct Tree
{
T value;
Tree *left{}, *right{};
 
std::generator<const T&> traverse_inorder() const
{
if (left)
co_yield std::ranges::elements_of(left->traverse_inorder());
 
co_yield value;
 
if (right)
co_yield std::ranges::elements_of(right->traverse_inorder());
}
};
 
int main()
{
Tree<char> tree[]
{
{'D', tree + 1, tree + 2},
// │
// ┌───────────────┴────────────────┐
// │ │
{'B', tree + 3, tree + 4}, {'F', tree + 5, tree + 6},
// │ │
// ┌─────────┴─────────────┐ ┌───────────┴─────────────┐
// │ │ │ │
{'A'}, {'C'}, {'E'}, {'G'}
};
 
for (char x : tree->traverse_inorder())
std::cout << x << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

A B C D E F G
