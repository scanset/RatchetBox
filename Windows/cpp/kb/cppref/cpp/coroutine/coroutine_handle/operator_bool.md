constexpr explicit operator bool() const noexcept;

(since C++20)

Checks whether *this is non-null, i.e. the value of *this is obtained from the promise object of some coroutine. Equivalent to return bool(address());.

If Promise is std::noop_coroutine_promise, this conversion function always returns true.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

bool(address()), or true if Promise is std::noop_coroutine_promise.
