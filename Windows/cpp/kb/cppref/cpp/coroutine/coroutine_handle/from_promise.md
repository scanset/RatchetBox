static coroutine_handle from_promise( Promise& p );

(since C++20)

Creates a coroutine_handle from the promise object of a coroutine. The created coroutine_handle refers the coroutine, and promise() returns a reference to p.

The behavior is undefined if p is not a reference to a promise object. This function is only provided for the primary template, i.e. specializations std::coroutine_handle<> and std::coroutine_handle<std::noop_coroutine_promise> do not have this function.

### Parameters

p

-

promise object of a coroutine to refer

### Return value

A coroutine_handle referring the given coroutine.
