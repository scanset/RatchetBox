constexpr void* address() const noexcept;

(since C++20)

Returns the underlying address of the coroutine_handle. The return value is non-null if and only if the current value of the coroutine_handle is obtained from a promise object of a coroutine.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The underlying address.

### Notes

The return value is non-null for specialization std::noop_coroutine_handle, because a std::noop_coroutine_handle cannot be created without referring to a no-op coroutine.
