The class template coroutine_handle can be used to refer to a suspended or executing coroutine. Every specialization of coroutine_handle is a LiteralType.

1) Primary template, can be created from the promise object of type Promise.

2) Specialization std::coroutine_handle<void> erases the promise type. It is convertible from other specializations.

3) Specialization std::coroutine_handle<std::noop_coroutine_promise> refers to no-op coroutines. It cannot be created from a promise object.

On typical implementations, every specialization of std::coroutine_handle is TriviallyCopyable.

If the program adds specializations for std::coroutine_handle, the behavior is undefined.

### Data members

Member name

Definition

ptr (private)

A pointer void* to the coroutine state.
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a coroutine_handle object 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns the coroutine_handle object 
(public member function)

#### Conversion 

operator coroutine_handle<>

obtains a type-erased coroutine_handle 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

done

checks if the coroutine has completed 
(public member function)

operator bool

checks if the handle represents a coroutine 
(public member function)

#### Control 

operator()resume

resumes execution of the coroutine 
(public member function)

destroy

destroys a coroutine 
(public member function)

#### Promise Access 

promise

access the promise of a coroutine 
(public member function)

from_promise

[static]

creates a coroutine_handle from the promise object of a coroutine 
(public static member function)

#### Export/Import 

address

exports the underlying address, i.e. the pointer backing the coroutine 
(public member function)

from_address

[static]

imports a coroutine from a pointer 
(public static member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator<=>

(C++20)

compares two coroutine_handle objects 
(function)

### Helper classes

std::hash<std::coroutine_handle>

(C++20)

hash support for std::coroutine_handle 
(class template specialization)

### Notes

A coroutine_handle may be dangling, in which case the coroutine_handle must be used carefully in order to avoid undefined behavior.

### Example

Run this code

#include <coroutine>
#include <iostream>
#include <optional>
 
template<std::movable T>
class Generator
{
public:
struct promise_type
{
Generator<T> get_return_object()
{
return Generator{Handle::from_promise(*this)};
}
static std::suspend_always initial_suspend() noexcept
{
return {};
}
static std::suspend_always final_suspend() noexcept
{
return {};
}
std::suspend_always yield_value(T value) noexcept
{
current_value = std::move(value);
return {};
}
// Disallow co_await in generator coroutines.
void await_transform() = delete;
[[noreturn]]
static void unhandled_exception() { throw; }
 
std::optional<T> current_value;
};
 
using Handle = std::coroutine_handle<promise_type>;
 
explicit Generator(const Handle coroutine) :
m_coroutine{coroutine}
{}
 
Generator() = default;
~Generator()
{
if (m_coroutine)
m_coroutine.destroy();
}
 
Generator(const Generator&) = delete;
Generator& operator=(const Generator&) = delete;
 
Generator(Generator&& other) noexcept :
m_coroutine{other.m_coroutine}
{
other.m_coroutine = {};
}
Generator& operator=(Generator&& other) noexcept
{
if (this != &other)
{
if (m_coroutine)
m_coroutine.destroy();
m_coroutine = other.m_coroutine;
other.m_coroutine = {};
}
return *this;
}
 
// Range-based for loop support.
class Iter
{
public:
void operator++()
{
m_coroutine.resume();
}
const T& operator*() const
{
return *m_coroutine.promise().current_value;
}
bool operator==(std::default_sentinel_t) const
{
return !m_coroutine | m_coroutine.done();
}
 
explicit Iter(const Handle coroutine) :
m_coroutine{coroutine}
{}
 
private:
Handle m_coroutine;
};
 
Iter begin()
{
if (m_coroutine)
m_coroutine.resume();
return Iter{m_coroutine};
}
 
std::default_sentinel_t end() { return {}; }
 
private:
Handle m_coroutine;
};
 
template<std::integral T>
Generator<T> range(T first, const T last)
{
while (first < last)
co_yield first++;
}
 
int main()
{
for (const char i : range(65, 91))
std::cout << i << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
