/*iterator*/ begin();

(since C++23)

Pushes coroutine_ into *active_ stack, then evaluates coroutine_.resume().

Before invocation of begin() the coroutine_ must refer to a coroutine suspended at its initial suspend point.

### Return value

An iterator whose coroutine_ member refers to the same coroutine as coroutine_ does.

### Notes

It is an undefined behavior to call begin() more than once on the same generator object.
