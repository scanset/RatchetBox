class /*iterator*/;

(exposition only*)

The return type of generator::begin. Models indirectly_readable and input_iterator.

### Member types

Member type

Definition

value_type

std::generator::value

difference_type

std::ptrdiff_t

### Data members

Member

Description

std::coroutine_handle<std::generator::promise_type> coroutine_

The coroutine handle
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs an iterator 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns another iterator 
(public member function)

operator*

returns an underlying value 
(public member function)

operator++operator++(int)

advances the iterator 
(public member function)

## std::generator::iterator::iterator

/*iterator*/( /*iterator*/&& other ) noexcept;

(since C++23)

Initializes coroutine_ with std::exchange(other.coroutine_, {});.

## std::generator::iterator::operator=

/*iterator*/& operator=( /*iterator*/&& other ) noexcept;

(since C++23)

Equivalent to coroutine_ = std::exchange(other.coroutine_, {});.

Returns: *this.

## std::generator::iterator::operator*

reference operator*() const

    noexcept( std::is_nothrow_copy_constructible_v<reference> );

(since C++23)

- Let reference be the std::generator's underlying type.

- Let for some generator object x its coroutine_ be in the stack *x.active_.

- Let x.active_->top() refer to a suspended coroutine with promise object p.

Equivalent to return static_cast<reference>(*p.value_);.

## std::generator::iterator::operator++

constexpr /*iterator*/& operator++();

(1)
(since C++23)

constexpr void operator++( int );

(2)
(since C++23)

1) Let for some generator object x the coroutine_ be in the stack *x.active_.

Equivalent to x.active_->top().resume().

Returns: *this.

2) Equivalent to ++*this;.

### Non-member functions

operator==

(C++23)

compares the underlying iterator with a sentinel 
(function)

## operator==(std::generator::iterator)

friend bool operator==( const /*iterator*/& i, std::default_sentinel_t );

(since C++23)

Equivalent to return i.coroutine_.done();.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::generator::iterator is an associated class of the arguments.
