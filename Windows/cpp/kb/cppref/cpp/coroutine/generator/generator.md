Constructs a generator.

1) The copy-constructor is deleted.

2) The move-constructor that initializes the underlying coroutine_ with std::exchange(other.coroutine_, {}), and the underlying stack of coroutine handles (active_) with std::exchange(other.active_, nullptr).
Note, that the iterators, previously obtained from other, are not invalidated, but become iterators into *this.
