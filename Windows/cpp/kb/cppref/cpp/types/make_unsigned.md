Defined in header <type_traits>

template< class T >

struct make_unsigned;

(since C++11)

If T is an integral (except bool) or enumeration type, provides the member typedef type which is the unsigned integer type corresponding to T, with the same cv-qualifiers.

If T is signed or unsigned char, short, int, long, long long; the unsigned type from this list corresponding to T is provided.

If T is an enumeration type or char, wchar_t, char8_t(since C++20), char16_t, char32_t; the unsigned integer type with the smallest rank having the same sizeof as T is provided.

Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

(until C++20)

Otherwise, the program is ill-formed.

(since C++20)

If the program adds specializations for std::make_unsigned, the behavior is undefined.

### Member types

Name

Definition

type

the unsigned integer type corresponding to T

### Helper types

template< class T >

using make_unsigned_t = typename make_unsigned<T>::type;

(since C++14)

### Example

Run this code

#include <type_traits>
 
int main()
{
using uchar_type = std::make_unsigned_t<char>;
using uint_type = std::make_unsigned_t<int>;
using ulong_type = std::make_unsigned_t<volatile long>;
 
static_assert(
std::is_same_v<uchar_type, unsigned char> and
std::is_same_v<uint_type, unsigned int> and
std::is_same_v<ulong_type, volatile unsigned long>
);
}
