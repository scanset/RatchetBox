Defined in header <type_traits>

template< class T >

struct is_member_object_pointer;

(since C++11)

std::is_member_object_pointer is a UnaryTypeTrait.

Checks whether T is a non-static member object pointer. Provides the member constant value which is equal to true, if T is a non-static member object pointer type. Otherwise, value is equal to false.

If the program adds specializations for std::is_member_object_pointer or std::is_member_object_pointer_v, the behavior is undefined.

### Template parameters

T

-

a type to check

### Helper variable template

template< class T >

constexpr bool is_member_object_pointer_v = is_member_object_pointer<T>::value;

(since C++17)

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

true if T is a pointer to member object, false otherwise 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator bool

converts the object to bool, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)

### Member types

Type

Definition

value_type

bool

type

std::integral_constant<bool, value>

### Possible implementation

template<class T>
struct is_member_object_pointer : std::integral_constant<
bool,
std::is_member_pointer<T>::value &&
!std::is_member_function_pointer<T>::value
> {};

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>
 
int main()
{
class C {};
std::cout << "Is member object pointer?\n" << std::boolalpha
<< std::is_member_object_pointer_v<int(C::*)>
<< ": int(C::*)\n"
<< std::is_member_object_pointer_v<int(C::*)()>
<< ": int(C::*)()\n";
}

Output:

Is member object pointer?
true: int(C::*)
false: int(C::*)()
