Defined in header <typeindex>

class type_index;

(since C++11)

The type_index class is a wrapper class around a std::type_info object, that can be used as index in associative and unordered associative containers. The relationship with type_info object is maintained through a pointer, therefore type_index is CopyConstructible and CopyAssignable.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs the object 
(public member function)

(destructor)

(implicitly declared)

destroys the type_index object 
(public member function)

operator=

(implicitly declared)

assigns a type_index object 
(public member function)

operator==operator!=operator<operator<=operator>operator>=operator<=>

(removed in C++20)(C++20)

compares the underlying std::type_info objects 
(public member function)

hash_code

returns hashed code 
(public member function)

name

returns implementation defined name of the type,
associated with underlying type_info object 
(public member function)

### Helper classes

std::hash<std::type_index>

(C++11)

hash support for std::type_index 
(class template specialization)

### Example

The following program is an example of an efficient type-value mapping.

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
#include <typeindex>
#include <typeinfo>
#include <unordered_map>
 
struct A
{
virtual ~A() {}
};
 
struct B : A {};
struct C : A {};
 
int main()
{
std::unordered_map<std::type_index, std::string> type_names;
 
type_names[std::type_index(typeid(int))] = "int";
type_names[std::type_index(typeid(double))] = "double";
type_names[std::type_index(typeid(A))] = "A";
type_names[std::type_index(typeid(B))] = "B";
type_names[std::type_index(typeid(C))] = "C";
 
int i;
double d;
A a;
 
// note that we're storing pointer to type A
std::unique_ptr<A> b(new B);
std::unique_ptr<A> c(new C);
 
std::cout << "i is " << type_names[std::type_index(typeid(i))] << '\n';
std::cout << "d is " << type_names[std::type_index(typeid(d))] << '\n';
std::cout << "a is " << type_names[std::type_index(typeid(a))] << '\n';
std::cout << "*b is " << type_names[std::type_index(typeid(*b))] << '\n';
std::cout << "*c is " << type_names[std::type_index(typeid(*c))] << '\n';
}

Output:

i is int
d is double
a is A
*b is B
*c is C
