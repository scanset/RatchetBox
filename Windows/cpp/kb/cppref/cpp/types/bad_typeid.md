Defined in header <typeinfo>

class bad_typeid : public std::exception;

An exception of this type is thrown when a typeid operator is applied to a dereferenced null pointer value of a polymorphic type.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new bad_typeid object 
(public member function)

operator=

replaces the bad_typeid object 
(public member function)

what

returns the explanatory string 
(public member function)

## std::bad_typeid::bad_typeid

(1)

bad_typeid() throw();

(until C++11)

bad_typeid() noexcept;

(since C++11)

(2)

bad_typeid( const bad_typeid& other ) throw();

(until C++11)

bad_typeid( const bad_typeid& other ) noexcept;

(since C++11)

Constructs a new bad_typeid object with an implementation-defined null-terminated byte string which is accessible through what().

1) Default constructor.

2) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::bad_typeid then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0.(since C++11)

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to copy

## std::bad_typeid::operator=

bad_typeid& operator=( const bad_typeid& other ) throw();

(until C++11)

bad_typeid& operator=( const bad_typeid& other ) noexcept;

(since C++11)

Assigns the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::bad_typeid then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment.(since C++11)

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to assign with

### Return value

*this

## std::bad_typeid::what

virtual const char* what() const throw();

(until C++11)

virtual const char* what() const noexcept;

(since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++26)

Returns the explanatory string.

### Return value

Pointer to an implementation-defined null-terminated string with explanatory information. The string is suitable for conversion and display as a std::wstring. The pointer is guaranteed to be valid at least until the exception object from which it is obtained is destroyed, or until a non-const member function (e.g. copy assignment operator) on the exception object is called.

The returned string is encoded with the ordinary literal encoding during constant evaluation.

(since C++26)

### Notes

Implementations are allowed but not required to override what().

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

(destructor)

[virtual]

destroys the exception object 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <typeinfo>
 
struct S // The type has to be polymorphic
{
virtual void f();
}; 
 
int main()
{
S* p = nullptr;
try
{
std::cout << typeid(*p).name() << '\n';
}
catch (const std::bad_typeid& e)
{
std::cout << e.what() << '\n';
}
}

Possible output:

Attempted a typeid of NULL pointer!
