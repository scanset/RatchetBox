Defined in header <type_traits>

template< class T >

struct has_virtual_destructor;

(since C++11)

std::has_virtual_destructor is a UnaryTypeTrait.

If T is a type with a virtual destructor, the base characteristic is std::true_type. For any other type, the base characteristic is std::false_type.

If T is an incomplete non-union class type, the behavior is undefined.

If the program adds specializations for std::has_virtual_destructor or std::has_virtual_destructor_v, the behavior is undefined.

### Template parameters

T

-

a type to check

### Helper variable template

template< class T >

constexpr bool has_virtual_destructor_v = has_virtual_destructor<T>::value;

(since C++17)

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

true if T has a virtual destructor, false otherwise 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator bool

converts the object to bool, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)

### Member types

Type

Definition

value_type

bool

type

std::integral_constant<bool, value>

### Notes

If a class C has a public virtual destructor, it can be derived from, and the derived object can be safely deleted through a pointer to the base object (GotW #18). In this case, std::is_polymorphic<C>::value is true.

### Example

Run this code

#include <type_traits>
 
struct S {};
static_assert(!std::has_virtual_destructor_v<S>);
 
struct B { virtual ~B() {} };
static_assert(std::has_virtual_destructor_v<B>);
 
struct D : B { ~D() {} };
static_assert(std::has_virtual_destructor_v<D>);
 
int main()
{
B* pd = new D;
delete pd;
}
