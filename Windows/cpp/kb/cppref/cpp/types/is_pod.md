Defined in header <type_traits>

template< class T >

struct is_pod;

(since C++11) 
(deprecated in C++20)

std::is_pod is a UnaryTypeTrait.

If T is a POD type ("plain old data type"), provides the member constant value equal to true. For any other type, value is false.

If std::remove_all_extents_t<T> is an incomplete type and not (possibly cv-qualified) void, the behavior is undefined.

If the program adds specializations for std::is_pod or std::is_pod_v, the behavior is undefined.

### Template parameters

T

-

a type to check

### Helper variable template

template< class T >

constexpr bool is_pod_v = is_pod<T>::value;

(since C++17) 
(deprecated in C++20)

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

true if T is a POD type, false otherwise 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator bool

converts the object to bool, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)

### Member types

Type

Definition

value_type

bool

type

std::integral_constant<bool, value>

### Example

Run this code

#include <type_traits>
 
struct A { int m; };
static_assert(std::is_pod_v<A> == true);
 
class B: public A { int m; };
static_assert(std::is_pod_v<B> == false);
 
struct C { virtual void foo(); };
static_assert(std::is_pod_v<C> == false);
 
int main() {}
