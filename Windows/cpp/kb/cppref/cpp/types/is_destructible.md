template< class T >

struct is_destructible;

(1)
(since C++11)

template< class T >

struct is_trivially_destructible;

(2)
(since C++11)

template< class T >

struct is_nothrow_destructible;

(3)
(since C++11)

1) If T is a reference type, provides the member constant value equal to true.

If T is (possibly cv-qualified) void, a function type, or an array of unknown bound, value equals false.

If T is an object type, then, for the type U that is std::remove_all_extents<T>::type, if the expression std::declval<U&>().~U() is well-formed in unevaluated context, value equals true. Otherwise, value equals false.

2) Same as (1) and additionally std::remove_all_extents<T>::type is either a non-class type or a class type with a trivial destructor.

3) Same as (1), but the destructor is noexcept.

If T is not a complete type, (possibly cv-qualified) void, or an array of unknown bound, the behavior is undefined.

If an instantiation of a template above depends, directly or indirectly, on an incomplete type, and that instantiation could yield a different result if that type were hypothetically completed, the behavior is undefined.

If the program adds specializations for any of the templates described on this page, the behavior is undefined.

### Helper variable templates

template< class T >

constexpr bool is_destructible_v = is_destructible<T>::value;

(since C++17)

template< class T >

constexpr bool is_trivially_destructible_v = is_trivially_destructible<T>::value;

(since C++17)

template< class T >

constexpr bool is_nothrow_destructible_v = is_nothrow_destructible<T>::value;

(since C++17)

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

true if T is destructible, false otherwise 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator bool

converts the object to bool, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)

### Member types

Type

Definition

value_type

bool

type

std::integral_constant<bool, value>

### Notes

Because the C++ program terminates if a destructor throws an exception during stack unwinding (which usually cannot be predicted), all practical destructors are non-throwing even if they are not declared noexcept. All destructors found in the C++ standard library are non-throwing.

Storage occupied by trivially destructible objects may be reused without calling the destructor.

### Possible implementation

is_destructible (1)

// C++20 required
template<typename t>
struct is_destructible
: std::integral_constant<bool, requires(t object) { object.~t(); }>
{};

is_trivially_destructible (2)

// Not real C++. Shall P2996 be approved, the following implementation will be available:
template<typename t>
struct is_trivially_destructible
: std::integral_constant<bool, std::meta::type_is_trivially_destructible(^t)>
{};

is_nothrow_destructible (3)

// C++20 required
template<typename t>
struct is_nothrow_destructible
: std::integral_constant<bool, requires(t object) { {object.~t()} noexcept; }>
{};

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <type_traits>
 
struct Foo
{
std::string str;
~Foo() noexcept {};
};
 
struct Bar
{
~Bar() = default;
};
 
static_assert(std::is_destructible<std::string>::value == true);
static_assert(std::is_trivially_destructible_v<Foo> == false);
static_assert(std::is_nothrow_destructible<Foo>() == true);
static_assert(std::is_trivially_destructible<Bar>{} == true);
 
int main() {}
