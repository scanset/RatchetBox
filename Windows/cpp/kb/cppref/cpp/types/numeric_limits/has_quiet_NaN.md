static const bool has_quiet_NaN;

(until C++11)

static constexpr bool has_quiet_NaN;

(since C++11)

The value of std::numeric_limits<T>::has_quiet_NaN is true for all types T capable of representing the special value "Quiet Not-A-Number". This constant is meaningful for all floating-point types and is guaranteed to be true if std::numeric_limits<T>::is_iec559 == true.
