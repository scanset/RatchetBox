static const bool traps;

(until C++11)

static constexpr bool traps;

(since C++11)

The value of std::numeric_limits<T>::traps is true for all arithmetic types T that have at least one value at the start of the program that, if used as an argument to an arithmetic operation, will generate a trap.

### Notes

On most platforms integer division by zero always traps, and std::numeric_limits<T>::traps is true for all integer types that support the value ​0​. The exception is the type bool: even though division by false traps due to integral promotion from bool to int, it is the zero-valued int that traps. Zero is not a value of type bool.

On most platforms, floating-point exceptions may be turned on and off at run time (e.g. feenableexcept() on Linux or _controlfp on Windows), in which case the value of std::numeric_limits<T>::traps for floating-point types reflects the state of floating-point trapping facility at the time of program startup, which is false on most modern systems. An exception would be a DEC Alpha program, where it is true if compiled without -ieee.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <limits>
 
int main()
{
std::cout << std::boolalpha
<< "bool: traps = " << std::numeric_limits<bool>::traps << '\n'
<< "char: traps = " << std::numeric_limits<char>::traps << '\n'
<< "char16_t: traps = " << std::numeric_limits<char16_t>::traps << '\n'
<< "long: traps = " << std::numeric_limits<long>::traps << '\n'
<< "float: traps = " << std::numeric_limits<float>::traps << '\n';
}

Possible output:

// GCC output:
bool: traps = true
char: traps = true
char16_t: traps = true
long: traps = true
float: traps = false
 
// Clang output:
bool: traps = false
char: traps = true
char16_t: traps = true
long: traps = true
float: traps = false
