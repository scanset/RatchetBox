Defined in header <type_traits>

template< class T >

struct make_signed;

(since C++11)

If T is an integral (except bool) or enumeration type, provides the member typedef type which is the signed integer type corresponding to T, with the same cv-qualifiers.

If T is signed or unsigned char, short, int, long, long long, the signed type from this list corresponding to T is provided.

If T is an enumeration type or char, wchar_t, char8_t(since C++20), char16_t, char32_t, the signed integer type with the smallest rank having the same sizeof as T is provided.

Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

(until C++20)

Otherwise, the program is ill-formed.

(since C++20)

If the program adds specializations for std::make_signed, the behavior is undefined.

### Member types

Name

Definition

type

the signed integer type corresponding to T

### Helper types

template< class T >

using make_signed_t = typename make_signed<T>::type;

(since C++14)

### Example

Run this code

#include <type_traits>
 
enum struct E : unsigned short {};
 
int main()
{
using char_type = std::make_signed_t<unsigned char>;
using int_type = std::make_signed_t<unsigned int>;
using long_type = std::make_signed_t<volatile unsigned long>;
using enum_type = std::make_signed_t<E>;
 
static_assert(
std::is_same_v<char_type, signed char> and
std::is_same_v<int_type, signed int> and
std::is_same_v<long_type, volatile signed long> and
std::is_same_v<enum_type, signed short>
);
}
