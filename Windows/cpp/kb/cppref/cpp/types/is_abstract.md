Defined in header <type_traits>

template< class T >

struct is_abstract;

(since C++11)

std::is_abstract is a UnaryTypeTrait.

If T is an abstract class (that is, a non-union class that declares or inherits at least one pure virtual function), provides the member constant value equal to true. For any other type, value is false.

If T is an incomplete non-union class type, the behavior is undefined.

If the program adds specializations for std::is_abstract or std::is_abstract_v, the behavior is undefined.

### Template parameters

T

-

a type to check

### Helper variable template

template< class T >

constexpr bool is_abstract_v = is_abstract<T>::value;

(since C++17)

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

true if T is an abstract class type, false otherwise 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator bool

converts the object to bool, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)

### Member types

Type

Definition

value_type

bool

type

std::integral_constant<bool, value>

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>
 
struct A { int m; };
static_assert(std::is_abstract_v<A> == false);
 
struct B { virtual void foo(); };
static_assert(std::is_abstract_v<B> == false);
 
struct C { virtual void foo() = 0; };
static_assert(std::is_abstract_v<C> == true);
 
struct D : C {};
static_assert(std::is_abstract_v<D> == true);
 
int main() {}

the behavior was undefined if
T is an incomplete union type

the base characteristic is
std::false_type in this case
