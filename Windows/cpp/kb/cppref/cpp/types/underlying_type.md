Defined in header <type_traits>

template< class T >

struct underlying_type;

(since C++11)

If T is a complete enumeration (enum) type, provides a member typedef type that names the underlying type of T.

Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

(until C++20)

Otherwise, if T is not an enumeration type, there is no member type. Otherwise (T is an incomplete enumeration type), the program is ill-formed.

(since C++20)

If the program adds specializations for std::underlying_type, the behavior is undefined.

### Member types

Name

Definition

type

the underlying type of T

### Helper types

template< class T >

using underlying_type_t = typename underlying_type<T>::type;

(since C++14)

### Notes

Each enumeration type has an underlying type, which can be

- Specified explicitly (both scoped and unscoped enumerations);

- Omitted, in which case it is int for scoped enumerations or an implementation-defined integral type capable of representing all values of the enum (for unscoped enumerations).

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>
 
enum e1 {};
enum class e2 {};
enum class e3 : unsigned {};
enum class e4 : int {};
 
int main()
{
constexpr bool e1_t = std::is_same_v<std::underlying_type_t<e1>, int>;
constexpr bool e2_t = std::is_same_v<std::underlying_type_t<e2>, int>;
constexpr bool e3_t = std::is_same_v<std::underlying_type_t<e3>, int>;
constexpr bool e4_t = std::is_same_v<std::underlying_type_t<e4>, int>;
 
std::cout
<< "underlying type for 'e1' is " << (e1_t ? "int" : "non-int") << '\n'
<< "underlying type for 'e2' is " << (e2_t ? "int" : "non-int") << '\n'
<< "underlying type for 'e3' is " << (e3_t ? "int" : "non-int") << '\n'
<< "underlying type for 'e4' is " << (e4_t ? "int" : "non-int") << '\n';
}

Possible output:

underlying type for 'e1' is non-int
underlying type for 'e2' is int
underlying type for 'e3' is non-int
underlying type for 'e4' is int
