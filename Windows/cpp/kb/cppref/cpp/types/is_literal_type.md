Defined in header <type_traits>

template< class T >

struct is_literal_type;

(since C++11) 
(deprecated in C++17) 
(removed in C++20)

std::is_literal_type is a UnaryTypeTrait.

(This type trait has been deprecated[1] and removed[2] as offering negligible value to generic code.)

If T satisfies all requirements of LiteralType, provides the member constant value equal to true. For any other type, value is false.

If std::remove_all_extents_t<T> is an incomplete type and not (possibly cv-qualified) void, the behavior is undefined.

If the program adds specializations for std::is_literal_type or std::is_literal_type_v, the behavior is undefined.

### Template parameters

T

-

a type to check

### Helper variable template

template< class T >

constexpr bool is_literal_type_v = is_literal_type<T>::value;

(since C++17) 
(deprecated) 
(removed in C++20)

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

true if T is a literal type, false otherwise 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator bool

converts the object to bool, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)

### Member types

Type

Definition

value_type

bool

type

std::integral_constant<bool, value>

### Notes

Only literal types may be used as parameters to or returned from constexpr functions. Only literal classes may have constexpr member functions.

### Example

Run this code

#include <type_traits>
 
struct A { int m; };
static_assert(std::is_literal_type_v<A> == true);
 
struct B { virtual ~B(); };
static_assert(std::is_literal_type_v<B> == false);
 
int main() {}
