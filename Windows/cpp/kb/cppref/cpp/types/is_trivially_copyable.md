Defined in header <type_traits>

template< class T >

struct is_trivially_copyable;

(since C++11)

std::is_trivially_copyable is a UnaryTypeTrait.

If T is a trivially copyable type, provides the member constant value equal to true. For any other type, value is false.

If std::remove_all_extents_t<T> is an incomplete type and not (possibly cv-qualified) void, the behavior is undefined.

If the program adds specializations for std::is_trivially_copyable or std::is_trivially_copyable_v, the behavior is undefined.

### Template parameters

T

-

a type to check

### Helper variable template

template< class T >

constexpr bool is_trivially_copyable_v = is_trivially_copyable<T>::value;

(since C++17)

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

true if T is a trivially copyable type, false otherwise 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator bool

converts the object to bool, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)

### Member types

Type

Definition

value_type

bool

type

std::integral_constant<bool, value>

### Notes

Objects of trivially-copyable types that are not potentially-overlapping subobjects are the only C++ objects that may be safely copied with std::memcpy or serialized to/from binary files with std::ofstream::write() / std::ifstream::read().

### Example

Run this code

#include <type_traits>
 
struct A { int m; };
static_assert(std::is_trivially_copyable_v<A> == true);
 
struct B { B(B const&) {} };
static_assert(std::is_trivially_copyable_v<B> == false);
 
struct C { virtual void foo(); };
static_assert(std::is_trivially_copyable_v<C> == false);
 
struct D
{
int m;
 
D(D const&) = default; // -> trivially copyable
D(int x) : m(x + 1) {}
};
static_assert(std::is_trivially_copyable_v<D> == true);
 
int main() {}
