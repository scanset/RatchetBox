Defined in header <cfloat>

#define FLT_EVAL_METHOD /* implementation-defined */

(since C++11)

Specifies the precision in which all floating-point arithmetic operations other than assignment and cast are done.

Value

Explanation

negative values except -1

implementation-defined behavior

-1

the default precision is not known

​0​

all operations and constants evaluate in the range and precision of the type used. Additionally, float_t and double_t are equivalent to float and double respectively

1

all operations and constants evaluate in the range and precision of double. Additionally, both float_t and double_t are equivalent to double

2

all operations and constants evaluate in the range and precision of long double. Additionally, both float_t and double_t are equivalent to long double

### Notes

Regardless of the value of FLT_EVAL_METHOD, any floating-point expression may be contracted, that is, calculated as if all intermediate results have infinite range and precision (unless 
#pragma STDC FP_CONTRACT is off).

Cast and assignment strip away any extraneous range and precision: this models the action of storing a value from an extended-precision FPU register into a standard-sized memory location.
