Defined in header <typeinfo>

class bad_cast : public std::exception;

An exception of this type is thrown when a dynamic_cast to a reference type fails the run-time check (e.g. because the types are not related by inheritance), and also from std::use_facet if the requested facet does not exist in the locale.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new bad_cast object 
(public member function)

operator=

replaces the bad_cast object 
(public member function)

what

returns the explanatory string 
(public member function)

## std::bad_cast::bad_cast

(1)

bad_cast() throw();

(until C++11)

bad_cast() noexcept;

(since C++11)

(2)

bad_cast( const bad_cast& other ) throw();

(until C++11)

bad_cast( const bad_cast& other ) noexcept;

(since C++11)

Constructs a new bad_cast object with an implementation-defined null-terminated byte string which is accessible through what().

1) Default constructor.

2) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::bad_cast then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0.(since C++11)

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to copy

## std::bad_cast::operator=

bad_cast& operator=( const bad_cast& other ) throw();

(until C++11)

bad_cast& operator=( const bad_cast& other ) noexcept;

(since C++11)

Assigns the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::bad_cast then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment.(since C++11)

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to assign with

### Return value

*this

## std::bad_cast::what

virtual const char* what() const throw();

(until C++11)

virtual const char* what() const noexcept;

(since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++26)

Returns the explanatory string.

### Return value

Pointer to an implementation-defined null-terminated string with explanatory information. The string is suitable for conversion and display as a std::wstring. The pointer is guaranteed to be valid at least until the exception object from which it is obtained is destroyed, or until a non-const member function (e.g. copy assignment operator) on the exception object is called.

The returned string is encoded with the ordinary literal encoding during constant evaluation.

(since C++26)

### Notes

Implementations are allowed but not required to override what().

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

(destructor)

[virtual]

destroys the exception object 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <typeinfo>
 
struct Foo { virtual ~Foo() {} };
struct Bar { virtual ~Bar() { std::cout << "~Bar\n"; } };
struct Pub : Bar { ~Pub() override { std::cout << "~Pub\n"; } };
 
int main()
{
Pub pub;
try
{
[[maybe_unused]]
Bar& r1 = dynamic_cast<Bar&>(pub); // OK, upcast
 
[[maybe_unused]]
Foo& r2 = dynamic_cast<Foo&>(pub); // throws
}
catch (const std::bad_cast& e)
{
std::cout << "e.what(): " << e.what() << '\n';
}
}

Possible output:

e.what(): std::bad_cast
~Pub
~Bar
