std::strong_ordering operator<=>( const type_index& rhs ) const noexcept;

(7)
(since C++20)

Compares the underlying std::type_info objects.

1,2) Checks whether the underlying std::type_info objects refer to the same type.

3-7) Compares the underlying std::type_info objects as defined by an implementation-defined ordering. The comparison is done by type_info::before.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

(since C++20)

### Parameters

rhs

-

another type_index object to compare to

### Return value

1) true if the underlying std::type_info objects refer to the same type, false otherwise.

2) true if the underlying std::type_info objects refer not to the same type, false otherwise.

3-6) true if the types referred by the underlying std::type_info objects are ordered by corresponding order, false otherwise.

7) std::strong_ordering::equal if the underlying std::type_info objects refer to the same type, otherwise std::strong_ordering::less if *this's underlying std::type_info object precedes rhs's in the implementation-defined ordering, otherwise std::strong_ordering::greater.
