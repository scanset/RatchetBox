Defined in header <algorithm>

template< class InputIt, class UnaryFunc >

UnaryFunc for_each( InputIt first, InputIt last, UnaryFunc f );

(1)
(constexpr since C++20)

template< class ExecutionPolicy, class ForwardIt, class UnaryFunc >

void for_each( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,

ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last, UnaryFunc f );

(2)
(since C++17)

Applies the given function object f to the result of dereferencing every iterator in the range [first, last). If f returns a result, the result is ignored.

1) f is applied in order starting from first.

If UnaryFunc is not MoveConstructible, the behavior is undefined.

(since C++11)

2) f might not be applied in order. The algorithm is executed according to policy.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.

(until C++20)

std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.

(since C++20)

If UnaryFunc is not CopyConstructible, the behavior is undefined.

If the iterator type (InputIt/ForwardIt) is mutable, f may modify the elements of the range through the dereferenced iterator.

Unlike the rest of the parallel algorithms, for_each is not allowed to make copies of the elements in the sequence even if they are TriviallyCopyable.

### Parameters

first, last

-

the range to apply the function to

policy

-

the execution policy to use

f

-

function object, to be applied to the result of dereferencing every iterator in the range [first, last)

The signature of the function should be equivalent to the following:

void fun(const Type &a);

The signature does not need to have const &. 
The type  Type must be such that an object of type InputIt can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to  Type.

​

Type requirements

-

InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

-

ForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.

### Return value

1) f

2) (none)

### Complexity

Exactly std::distance(first, last) applications of f.

### Exceptions

The overload with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy reports errors as follows:

- If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.

- If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

### Possible implementation

See also the implementations in libstdc++, libc++ and MSVC stdlib.

template<class InputIt, class UnaryFunc>
constexpr UnaryFunc for_each(InputIt first, InputIt last, UnaryFunc f)
{
for (; first != last; ++first)
f(*first);
 
return f; // implicit move since C++11
}

### Notes

For overload (1), f can be a stateful function object. The return value can be considered as the final state of the batch operation.

For overload (2), multiple copies of f may be created to perform parallel invocation. No value is returned because parallelization often does not permit efficient state accumulation.

### Example

The following example uses a lambda-expression to increment all of the elements of a vector and then uses an overloaded operator() in a function object (a.k.a., "functor") to compute their sum. Note that to compute the sum, it is recommended to use the dedicated algorithm std::accumulate.

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
std::vector<int> v{3, -4, 2, -8, 15, 267};
 
auto print = [](const int& n) { std::cout << n << ' '; };
 
std::cout << "before:\t";
std::for_each(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), print);
std::cout << '\n';
 
// increment elements in-place
std::for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int &n) { n++; });
 
std::cout << "after:\t";
std::for_each(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), print);
std::cout << '\n';
 
struct Sum
{
void operator()(int n) { sum += n; }
int sum {0};
};
 
// invoke Sum::operator() for each element
Sum s = std::for_each(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), Sum()); 
std::cout << "sum:\t" << s.sum << '\n';
}

Output:

before: 3 -4 2 -8 15 267 
after: 4 -3 3 -7 16 268 
sum: 281

it was unclear whether f can modify the elements

classified as “non-modifying sequence operations”)

iterator type is mutable)

overload (1) returned std::move(f)

returns f (which implicitly moves)
