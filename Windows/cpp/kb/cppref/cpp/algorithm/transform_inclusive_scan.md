1) Computes the inclusive prefix sum using op.

For each integer i in [​0​, std::distance(first, last)), performs the following operations in order:

- Creates a sequence which is formed by the values transformed from the elements of [first, iter] in order by unary_op, where iter is the next ith iterator of first.

- Computes the generalized noncommutative sum of the sequence over binary_op.

- Assigns the result to *dest, where dest is the next ith iterator of d_first.

3) Same as (1), but each sequence created is formed by init followed by the elements of [first, iter] in order.

2,4) Same as (1,3), but executed according to policy.

These overloads participate in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.

(until C++20)

std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.

(since C++20)

The generalized noncommutative sum of a sequence of elements over a binary operation binary_op is defined as follows:

- If the sequence only has one element, the sum is the value of the element.

- Otherwise, performs the following operations in order:

- Selects any two adjacent elements elem1 and elem2 from the sequence.

- Calculates binary_op(elem1, elem2) and replaces the two elements in the sequence with the result.

- Repeats steps 1 and 2 until there is only one element in the sequence.

The result is non-deterministic if the binary_op is not associative (such as floating-point addition).

For overloads (1,2), if binary_op(unary_op(*first), unary_op(*first)) is not convertible to the value type of decltype(first), the program is ill-formed.

For overloads (3,4), if any of the following values is not convertible to T, the program is ill-formed:

- binary_op(init, init)

- binary_op(init, unary_op(*first))

- binary_op(unary_op(*first), unary_op(*first))

If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined:

- For overloads (1,2), the value type of decltype(first) is not MoveConstructible.

- For overloads (3,4), T is not MoveConstructible.

- unary_op or binary_op modifies any element of [first, last).

- unary_op or binary_op invalidates any iterator or subrange of [first, last].

### Parameters

first, last

-

the range of elements to sum

d_first

-

the beginning of the destination range; may be equal to first

policy

-

the execution policy to use

init

-

the initial value

unary_op

-

unary FunctionObject that will be applied to each element of the input range. The return type must be acceptable as input to binary_op.

binary_op

-

binary FunctionObject that will be applied in to the result of unary_op, the results of other binary_op, and init if provided

Type requirements

-

InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

-

OutputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator.

-

ForwardIt1, ForwardIt2 must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.

### Return value

Iterator to the element past the last element written.

### Complexity

Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as std::distance(first, last):

1-4) \(\scriptsize O(N)\)O(N) applications of unary_op and binary_op respectively.

### Exceptions

The overloads with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy report errors as follows:

- If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.

- If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

### Notes

unary_op is never applied to init.

The parameter init appears last, differing from std::transform_exclusive_scan, because it is optional for this function.

### Example

Run this code

#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
std::vector data{3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6};
 
auto times_10 = [](int x) { return x * 10; };
 
std::cout << "10 times exclusive sum: ";
std::transform_exclusive_scan(data.begin(), data.end(),
std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, " "),
0, std::plus<int>{}, times_10);
std::cout << "\n10 times inclusive sum: ";
std::transform_inclusive_scan(data.begin(), data.end(),
std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, " "),
std::plus<int>{}, times_10);
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

10 times exclusive sum: 0 30 40 80 90 140 230 250 
10 times inclusive sum: 30 40 80 90 140 230 250 310
