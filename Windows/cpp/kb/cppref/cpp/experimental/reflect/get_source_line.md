Defined in header <experimental/reflect>

template< Object T >

struct get_source_line;

(reflection TS)

Provides the member constant value equal to the presumed line number of the declaration of the entity or typedef-name reflected by T.

### Helper variable template 

template< class T >

constexpr auto get_source_line_v = get_source_line<T>::value;

(reflection TS)

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

the presumed line number of the declaration of the entity or typedef-name reflected by T 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator std::uint_least32_t

converts the object to std::uint_least32_t, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)

### Member types

Definition

value_type

std::uint_least32_t

type

std::integral_constant<std::uint_least32_t, value>

### Example

The following code shows the source code line of an object or a class.

Run this code

#include<experimental/reflect>
#include<iostream>
 
using refl = std::experimental::reflect;
 
float f;
struct P{};
 
int main()
{
std::cout << refl::get_source_line_v<reflexpr(f)> << '\n';
std::cout << refl::get_source_line_v<reflexpr(P)> << '\n';
}

Output:

6
7
