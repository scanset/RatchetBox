Defined in header <experimental/memory_resource>

memory_resource* null_memory_resource() noexcept;

(library fundamentals TS)

Returns a pointer to a memory_resource that doesn't perform any allocation.

### Return value 

Returns a pointer p to a static storage duration object of a type derived from std::experimental::pmr::memory_resource, with the following properties:

- its allocate() function always throws std::bad_alloc;

- its deallocate() function has no effect;

- for any memory_resource r, p->is_equal(r) returns &r == p.

The same value is returned every time this function is called.
