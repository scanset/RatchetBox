The C++ Extensions for Parallelism Version 2, ISO/IEC TS 19570:2018 defines the following new components for the C++ standard library:

### Parallel exceptions

Defined in header <experimental/exception_list> 

exception_list

exceptions raised during parallel executions 
(class)

### Execution policies

Defined in header <experimental/execution_policy> 

unsequenced_policyvector_policy

execution policy types 
(class)

unseqvec

global execution policy objects 
(constant)

### Parallel algorithms

### Task Block

### Data-Parallel Types

simd

(parallelism TS v2)

data-parallel vector type 
(class template)

simd_mask

(parallelism TS v2)

data-parallel type with the element type bool 
(class template)

### Feature test macros

Defined in header <experimental/task_block> 

__cpp_lib_experimental_parallel_task_block

a value of at least 201711 indicates that the task block functionality is supported 
(macro constant)

Defined in header <experimental/execution> 

__cpp_lib_experimental_execution_vector_policy

a value of at least 201711 indicates that the vector and wavefront policies are supported 
(macro constant)

Defined in header <experimental/algorithm> 

__cpp_lib_experimental_parallel_for_loop

a value of at least 201711 indicates that the for_loop class of algorithms is supported 
(macro constant)

Defined in header <experimental/simd> 

__cpp_lib_experimental_parallel_simd

a value of at least 201803 indicates that the data-parallel types library is supported 
(macro constant)
