(implicitly declared)

1) Constructs the iterator with the private ostream_type* member initialized with std::addressof(stream), the private delimiter member initialized with delimiter, and the private "first element" flag set to true.

2) Constructs the iterator with the private ostream_type* member initialized with std::addressof(stream), the private delimiter member initialized with std::move(delimiter), and the private "first element" flag set to true.

3,4) Implicitly declared copy/move constructor that copy/move constructs the private stream pointer, delimiter, and "first element" flag members.

### Parameters

stream

-

the output stream to be accessed by this iterator

delimiter

-

the delimiter to be inserted into the stream in between two outputs

other

-

the ostream_joiner object from which this object is to be copy- or move-constructed
