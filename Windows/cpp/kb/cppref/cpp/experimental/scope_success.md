class scope_success;

(library fundamentals TS v3)

The class template scope_success is a general-purpose scope guard intended to call its exit function when a scope is normally exited.

scope_success is not CopyConstructible, CopyAssignable or MoveAssignable, however, it may be MoveConstructible if EF meets some requirements, which permits wrapping a scope_success into another object.

A scope_success may be either active, i.e. calls its exit function on destruction, or inactive, i.e. does nothing on destruction. A scope_success is active after constructed from an exit function.

A scope_success can become inactive by calling release() on it either manually or automatically (by the move constructor). An inactive scope_success may also be obtained by initializing with another inactive scope_success. Once a scope_success is inactive, it cannot become active again.

A scope_success effectively holds an EF and a bool flag indicating if it is active, alongwith a counter of uncaught exceptions used for detecting whether the destructor is called during stack unwinding.

### Template parameters

EF

-

type of stored exit function

Type requirements

-

EF shall be either:

- a Destructible FunctionObject type,

- an lvalue reference to FunctionObject,

- an lvalue reference to function.

-

Calling an lvalue of std::remove_reference_t<EF> with no argument shall be well-formed.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new scope_success 
(public member function)

(destructor)

calls the exit function when the scope is exited normally if the scope_success is active, then destroys the scope_success 
(public member function)

operator=

[deleted]

scope_success is not assignable 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

release

makes the scope_success inactive 
(public member function)

### Deduction guides

### Notes

Constructing a scope_success of dynamic storage duration might lead to unexpected behavior.

Constructing a scope_success is constructed from another scope_success created in a different thread might also lead to unexpected behavior since the count of uncaught exceptions obtained in different threads may be compared during the destruction.

If the EF stored in a scope_success object refers to a local variable of the function where it is defined, e.g., as a lambda capturing the variable by reference, and that variable is used as a return operand in that function, that variable might have already been returned when the scope_success's destructor executes, calling the exit function. This can lead to surprising behavior.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string_view>
#include <experimental/scope>
 
void print_exit_status(std::string_view name, bool exit_status, bool did_throw) {
std::cout << name << ":\n";
std::cout << " Throwed exception " << (did_throw ? "yes" : "no") << "\n";
std::cout << " Exit status " << (exit_status ? "finished" : "pending") << "\n\n";
}
 
// Randomly throw an exception (50% chance)
void maybe_throw() {
if (std::rand() >= RAND_MAX / 2)
throw std::exception{};
}
 
int main() {
bool exit_status{false}, did_throw{false};
 
// Manual handling at "end of scope"
try {
maybe_throw();
exit_status = true; 
} catch (...) { did_throw = true; }
print_exit_status("Manual handling", exit_status, did_throw);
 
// Using scope_exit: runs on scope exit (success or exception)
exit_status = did_throw = false;
try {
auto guard = std::experimental::scope_exit{[&]{ exit_status = true; } };
maybe_throw();
} catch (...) { did_throw = true; }
print_exit_status("scope_exit", exit_status, did_throw);
 
// Using scope_fail: runs only if an exception occurs
exit_status = did_throw = false;
try {
auto guard = std::experimental::scope_fail{[&]{ exit_status = true; } };
maybe_throw();
} catch (...) { did_throw = true; }
print_exit_status("scope_fail", exit_status, did_throw);
 
// Using scope_success: runs only if no exception occurs
exit_status = did_throw = false;
try {
auto guard = std::experimental::scope_success{[&]{ exit_status = true; } };
maybe_throw();
} catch (...) { did_throw = true; }
print_exit_status("scope_success", exit_status, did_throw);
}

Output:

Manual handling:
Throwed exception yes
Exit status pending
 
scope_exit:
Throwed exception no
Exit status finished
 
scope_fail:
Throwed exception yes
Exit status finished
 
scope_success:
Throwed exception yes
Exit status pending
