class observer_ptr;

(library fundamentals TS v2)

std::experimental::observer_ptr is a non-owning pointer, or observer. The observer stores a pointer to a second object, known as the watched object. An observer_ptr may also have no watched object. 

An observer is not responsible in any way for the watched object; there is no inherent relationship between an observer and the object it watches.

It is intended as a near drop-in replacement for raw pointer types, with the advantage that, as a vocabulary type, it indicates its intended use without need for detailed analysis by code readers.

Specializations of observer_ptr satisfy the requirements of CopyConstructible and CopyAssignable.

Type requirements

-

W shall not be a reference type, but may be an incomplete type.

### Member types

Member type

Definition

element_type

W, the type of the object watched by this observer_ptr

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new observer_ptr 
(public member function)

(destructor)

(implicitly declared)

destructs an observer_ptr 
(public member function)

operator=

(implicitly declared)

implicitly declared copy and move assignment operators that assign the stored pointer 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

release

returns a pointer to the watched object and stops watching the object 
(public member function)

reset

replaces the watched object 
(public member function)

swap

swaps the watched objects 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

get

returns a pointer to the watched object 
(public member function)

operator bool

checks if there is an associated watched object 
(public member function)

operator*operator->

dereferences pointer to the watched object 
(public member function)

#### Conversions 

operator element_type*

explicit conversion function to the stored pointer 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

make_observer

creates an observer_ptr that watches an object 
(function template)

operator==operator!=operator<operator<=operator>operator>=

compares to another observer_ptr or with nullptr 
(function template)

std::experimental::swap(std::experimental::observer_ptr)

specializes the swap algorithm 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::hash<std::experimental::observer_ptr>

hash support for observer_ptr 
(class template specialization)
