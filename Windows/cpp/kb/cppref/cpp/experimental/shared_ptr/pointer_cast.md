Creates a new instance of std::experimental::shared_ptr whose stored pointer is obtained from r's stored pointer using a cast expression. If r is empty, so is the new shared_ptr (but its stored pointer is not necessarily null).

Otherwise, the new shared_ptr will share ownership with r, except that it is empty if the dynamic_cast performed by dynamic_pointer_cast returns a null pointer.

Let Y be typename std::experimental::shared_ptr<T>::element_type, then the resulting std::experimental::shared_ptr's stored pointer will be obtained by calling (in respective order):

1) static_cast<Y*>(r.get()).

2) dynamic_cast<Y*>(r.get()) (if the result of the dynamic_cast is a null pointer value, the returned shared_ptr will be empty).

3) const_cast<Y*>(r.get()).

4) reinterpret_cast<Y*>(r.get()).

The behavior of these functions is undefined unless the corresponding cast from U* to T* is well formed:

1) The behavior is undefined unless static_cast<T*>((U*)nullptr) is well formed.

2) The behavior is undefined unless dynamic_cast<T*>((U*)nullptr) is well formed.

3) The behavior is undefined unless const_cast<T*>((U*)nullptr) is well formed.

4) The behavior is undefined unless reinterpret_cast<T*>((U*)nullptr) is well formed.
