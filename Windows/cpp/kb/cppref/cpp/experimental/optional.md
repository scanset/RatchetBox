template< class T >

class optional;

(library fundamentals TS)

The class template std::experimental::optional manages an optional contained value, i.e. a value that may or may not be present.

A common use case for optional is the return value of a function that may fail. As opposed to other approaches, such as std::pair<T,bool>, optional handles expensive to construct objects well and is more readable, as the intent is expressed explicitly.

Any instance of optional<T> at any given point in time either contains a value or does not contain a value.

If an optional<T> contains a value, the value is guaranteed to be allocated as part of the optional object footprint, i.e. no dynamic memory allocation ever takes place. Thus, an optional object models an object, not a pointer, even though the operator*() and operator->() are defined.

When an object of type optional<T> is contextually converted to bool, the conversion returns true if the object contains a value and false if it does not contain a value.

The optional object contains a value in the following conditions:

- The object is initialized with a value of type T.

- The object is assigned from another optional that contains a value.

The object does not contain a value in the following conditions:

- The object is default-initialized.

- The object is initialized with a value of std::experimental::nullopt_t or an optional object that does not contain a value.

- The object is assigned from a value of std::experimental::nullopt_t or from an optional that does not contain a value.

### Template parameters

T

-

the type of the value to manage initialization state for. The type must meet the requirements of Destructible.

### Member types

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs the optional object 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destroys the contained value, if there is one 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns contents 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

operator->operator*

accesses the contained value 
(public member function)

operator bool

checks whether the object contains a value 
(public member function)

value

returns the contained value 
(public member function)

value_or

returns the contained value if available, another value otherwise 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

swap

exchanges the contents 
(public member function)

emplace

constructs the contained value in-place 
(public member function)

### Member objects

Member name

Definition

val (private)

pointer to the contained value (which points at a data member of the same object), the name is for exposition only

(function template)

make_optional

creates an optional object 
(function template)
