(1)

shared_future( std::experimental::shared_future<T>&& f ) noexcept;

(2)

shared_future( const std::experimental::shared_future<T>& f );

(3)

shared_future( std::experimental::future<std::experimental::shared_future<T>> && other ) noexcept;

(4)

shared_future( std::experimental::future<T>&& f ) noexcept;

(5)

1) Default constructor. Constructs an empty shared_future object that does not refer to a shared state.

2) Constructs a shared_future object, transferring the shared state held by f, if any. After construction, f.valid() is false.

3) Constructs a shared future that refers to the same shared state as f, if any.

4) Unwrapping constructor. Constructs a shared_future object from the shared state referred to by other, if any. If other.valid() == false prior to this call, the constructed shared_future object is empty. Otherwise, the resulting shared_future object becomes ready when one of the following happens:

- other and other.get() are both ready. The value or exception from other.get() is stored in the shared state associated with the resulting shared_future object.

- other is ready, but other.get() is invalid. An exception of type std::future_error with an error condition of std::future_errc::broken_promise is stored in the shared state associated with the resulting shared_future object.

After this constructor returns, valid() is equal to the value of other.valid() prior to this call, and other.valid() == false.

5) Constructs a shared_future object, transferring the shared state held by f, if any. After construction, f.valid() is false.
