This page is about the modified version of std::packaged_task with type-erased allocator support provided by the Library Fundamentals TSes. For the version of packaged_task provided by the concurrency TS supporting the std::future improvements made by that TS, see std::experimental::concurrency_v1::packaged_task.

std::experimental::fundamentals_v1::packaged_task (and std::experimental::fundamentals_v2::packaged_task) is a modified version of std::packaged_task provided by the library fundamentals TS with support for type-erased allocators.

### Member types 

Member type

Definition

allocator_type

std::experimental::erased_type

### Member functions 

(constructor)

constructs the task object 
(public member function)

get_memory_resource

retrieves a pointer to the memory resource used by this object to allocate memory 
(public member function)

### Non-member function 

std::experimental::swap(std::experimental::packaged_task)

specializes the swap algorithm 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::uses_allocator<std::experimental::packaged_task>

specializes the std::uses_allocator type trait 
(class template specialization)

## Members identical to std::packaged_task 

### Member functions

(destructor)

destructs the task object 
(public member function of std::packaged_task<R(Args...)>)

operator=

moves the task object 
(public member function of std::packaged_task<R(Args...)>)

valid

checks if the task object has a valid function 
(public member function of std::packaged_task<R(Args...)>)

swap

swaps two task objects 
(public member function of std::packaged_task<R(Args...)>)

#### Getting the result 

get_future

returns a std::future associated with the promised result 
(public member function of std::packaged_task<R(Args...)>)

#### Execution 

operator()

executes the function 
(public member function of std::packaged_task<R(Args...)>)

make_ready_at_thread_exit

executes the function ensuring that the result is ready only once the current thread exits 
(public member function of std::packaged_task<R(Args...)>)

reset

resets the state abandoning any stored results of previous executions 
(public member function of std::packaged_task<R(Args...)>)
