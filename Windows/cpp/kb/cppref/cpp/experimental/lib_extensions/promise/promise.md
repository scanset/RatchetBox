Constructs a std::experimental::promise object.

1) Default constructor. Constructs the promise with an empty shared state. 

2) Constructs the promise with an empty shared state. The shared state is allocated using alloc, which is treated as a type-erased allocator (see below).

3) Move constructor. Constructs the promise with the shared state of other using move semantics. After construction, other has no shared state.

4) std::experimental::promise is not copyable.

### Type-erased allocator 

The constructors of promise taking an allocator argument alloc treats that argument as a type-erased allocator. The memory resource pointer used by promise to allocate memory is determined using the allocator argument (if specified) as follows:

Type of alloc

Value of the memory resource pointer

Non-existent (no allocator specified at time of construction)

The value of std::experimental::pmr::get_default_resource() at time of construction.

std::nullptr_t

The value of std::experimental::pmr::get_default_resource() at time of construction.

A pointer type convertible to
std::experimental::pmr::memory_resource*

static_cast<std::experimental::pmr::memory_resource*>(alloc)

A specialization of
std::experimental::pmr::polymorphic_allocator

alloc.resource()

Any other type meeting the Allocator requirements

A pointer to a value of type std::experimental::pmr::resource_adaptor<A>(alloc), where A is the type of alloc. The pointer remains valid only for the lifetime of the promise object.

None of the above

The program is ill-formed.

### Parameters

alloc

-

allocator to use to allocate the shared state

other

-

another std::experimental::promise to acquire the state from
