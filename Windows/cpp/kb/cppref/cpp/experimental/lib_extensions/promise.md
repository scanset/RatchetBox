This page is about the modified version of std::promise with type-erased allocator support provided by the Library Fundamentals TSes. For the version of promise provided by the concurrency TS supporting the std::future improvements made by that TS, see std::experimental::concurrency_v1::promise.

std::experimental::fundamentals_v1::promise (and std::experimental::fundamentals_v2::promise) is a modified version of std::promise provided by the library fundamentals TS with support for type-erased allocators.

### Member types 

Member type

Definition

allocator_type

std::experimental::erased_type

### Member functions 

(constructor)

constructs the promise object 
(public member function)

get_memory_resource

retrieves a pointer to the memory resource used by this object to allocate memory 
(public member function)

### Non-member function 

std::experimental::swap(std::experimental::promise)

specializes the swap algorithm 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::uses_allocator<std::experimental::promise>

specializes the std::uses_allocator type trait 
(class template specialization)

## Members identical to std::promise 

### Member functions

(destructor)

destructs the promise object 
(public member function of std::promise<R>)

operator=

assigns the shared state 
(public member function of std::promise<R>)

swap

swaps two promise objects 
(public member function of std::promise<R>)

#### Getting the result 

get_future

returns a future associated with the promised result 
(public member function of std::promise<R>)

#### Setting the result 

set_value

sets the result to specific value 
(public member function of std::promise<R>)

set_value_at_thread_exit

sets the result to specific value while delivering the notification only at thread exit 
(public member function of std::promise<R>)

set_exception

sets the result to indicate an exception 
(public member function of std::promise<R>)

set_exception_at_thread_exit

sets the result to indicate an exception while delivering the notification only at thread exit 
(public member function of std::promise<R>)
