~scope_success() noexcept(noexcept(std::declval<EF&>()()));

(library fundamentals TS v3)

Calls the exit function if the result of std::uncaught_exceptions() is less than or equal to the counter of uncaught exceptions (typically on normal exit) and the scope_success is active, then destroys the stored EF (if it is a function object) and any other non-static data members.

### Exceptions

Throws any exception thrown by calling the exit function.

### Notes

Whether the destructor is called on stack unwinding can be detected by the comparison of the result of std::uncaught_exceptions() and the counter of uncaught exceptions in the scope_success.

Unlike other classes or class template specializations in the C++ standard library and other C++ TR/TS's, scope_success's destructor is permitted to throw an exception.
