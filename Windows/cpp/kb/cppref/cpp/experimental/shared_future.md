The class template std::experimental::shared_future extends std::shared_future with the following operations:

- an unwrapping constructor from future<shared_future<T>>;

- a member function is_ready to query whether the associated shared state is ready; and

- a member function then to attach a continuation to the future.

There is no interoperation between std::experimental::shared_future and std::shared_future.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a shared_future 
(public member function)

is_ready

checks if the shared state is ready 
(public member function)

then

attaches a continuation to a shared_future 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns the contents 
(public member function)

## Members identical to std::shared_future 

### Member functions

(destructor)

destructs the future object 
(public member function of std::shared_future<T>)

#### Getting the result 

get

returns the result 
(public member function of std::shared_future<T>)

#### State 

valid

checks if the future has a shared state 
(public member function of std::shared_future<T>)

wait

waits for the result to become available 
(public member function of std::shared_future<T>)

wait_for

waits for the result, returns if it is not available for the specified timeout duration 
(public member function of std::shared_future<T>)

wait_until

waits for the result, returns if it is not available until specified time point has been reached 
(public member function of std::shared_future<T>)
