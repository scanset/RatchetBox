virtual bool is_equal( const memory_resource& other ) const noexcept = 0;

(library fundamentals TS)

Compares *this for equality with other.

Two memory_resources compare equal if and only if memory allocated from one memory_resource can be deallocated from the other and vice versa.

### Notes

The most-derived type of other may not match the most derived type of *this. A derived class implementation therefore must typically check whether the most derived types of *this and other match using dynamic_cast, and immediately return false if the cast fails.
