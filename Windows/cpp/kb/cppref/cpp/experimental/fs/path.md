class path;

(filesystem TS)

Objects of type path represent paths on a filesystem. Only syntactic aspects of paths are handled: the pathname may represent a non-existing path or even one that is not allowed to exist on the current file system or OS.

The path name has the following syntax:

- root-name(optional): identifies the root on a filesystem with multiple roots (such as "C:" or "//myserver". POSIX filesystems have single root.

- root-directory(optional): a directory separator that, if present, marks this path as absolute. If it is missing (and the first element other than the root name is a file name), then the path is relative and requires another path as the starting location to resolve to a file name.

- Zero or more of the following:

- file-name: sequence of characters that aren't directory separators or preferred directory separators (additional limitations may be imposed by the OS or file system). This name may identify a file, a hard link, a symbolic link, or a directory. Two special file-names are recognized:

- dot: the file name consisting of a single dot character . is a directory name that refers to the current directory.

- dot-dot: the file name consisting of two dot characters .. is a directory name that refers to the parent directory.

- directory-separators: the forward slash character / or the alternative character provided as path::preferred_separator. If this character is repeated, it is treated as a single directory separator: /usr///////lib is the same as /usr/lib.

The path can be traversed element-wise via iterators returned by the begin() and end() functions, which iterates over root name, root directory, and the subsequent file name elements (directory separators are skipped except the one that identifies the root directory). If the very last element in the path is a directory separator, the last iterator will dereference to a file name dot.

Calling any non-const member function of a path invalidates all iterators referring to elements of that object.

If the OS uses a native syntax that is different from the portable generic syntax described above, all library functions accept path names in both formats.

Paths are implicitly convertible to and from std::basic_strings, which makes it possible to use them with other file APIs, e.g. as an argument to std::ifstream::open.

### Member types

Type

Definition

value_type

character type used by the native encoding of the filesystem: char on POSIX, wchar_t on Windows

string_type

std::basic_string<value_type>

const_iterator

a constant LegacyBidirectionalIterator with a value_type of path

iterator

an alias to const_iterator

### Member constants

constexpr value_type preferred_separator

[static]

alternative directory separator which may be used in addition to the portable /. On Windows, this is the backslash character \. On POSIX, this is the same forward slash / as the portable separator 
(public static member constant)
