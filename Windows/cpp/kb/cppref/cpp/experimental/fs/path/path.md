Constructs a new path object.

1) Constructs an empty path.

2) Copy constructor. Constructs a copy of p.

3) Move constructor. Constructs a copy of p, p is left in valid but unspecified state.

4,5) Constructs the path from a character sequence provided by source (4), which is a pointer or an input iterator to a null-terminated character/wide character sequence or an std::basic_string, or represented as a pair of input iterators [first, last) (5). Any of the four character types char, char16_t, char32_t, wchar_t is allowed, and the method of conversion to the native character set depends on the character type used by source.

- If the source character type is char, the encoding of the source is assumed to be the native narrow encoding (so no conversion takes place on POSIX systems).

- If the source character type is char16_t, conversion from UTF-16 to native filesystem encoding is used.

- If the source character type is char32_t, conversion from UTF-32 to native filesystem encoding is used.

- If the source character type is wchar_t, the input is assumed to be the native wide encoding (so no conversion takes places on Windows).

6,7) Constructs the path from a character sequence provided by source (6), which is a pointer or an input iterator to a null-terminated character sequence or an std::string, or represented as a pair of input iterators [first, last) (7). The only character type allowed is char. Uses loc to perform the character encoding conversion. If value_type is wchar_t, converts from to wide using the std::codecvt<wchar_t, char, std::mbstate_t> facet of loc. Otherwise, first converts to wide using the std::codecvt<wchar_t, char, std::mbstate_t> facet and then converts to filesystem native character type using std::codecvt<wchar_t, value_type> facet of loc.

### Parameters

p

-

a path to copy

source

-

a std::basic_string, pointer to a null-terminated character string, or an input iterator with a character value type that points to a null-terminated character sequence (the character type must be char for overload (6)

first, last

-

pair of LegacyInputIterators that specify a UTF-8 encoded character sequence

loc

-

locale that defines encoding conversion to use

Type requirements

-

InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

-

The value type of InputIt must be one of the four character types char, wchar_t, char16_t and char32_t to use the overload (5).

-

The value type of InputIt must be char to use the overload (7).

### Exceptions

1,2) (none)

3) noexcept specification:  noexcept

4-7) (none)

### Notes

For portable pathname generation from Unicode strings, see u8path.

### Example

Run this code

#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <iostream>
namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
fs::path p1 = "/usr/lib/sendmail.cf"; // portable format
fs::path p2 = "C:\\users\\abcdef\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\"; // native format
fs::path p3 = L"D:/猫.txt"; // wide string
 
std::cout << "p1 = " << p1 << '\n'
<< "p2 = " << p2 << '\n'
<< "p3 = " << p3 << '\n';
}

Output:

p1 = "/usr/lib/sendmail.cf"
p2 = "C:\users\abcdef\AppData\Local\Temp\"
p3 = "D:/猫.txt"
