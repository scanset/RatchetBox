Defined in header <experimental/filesystem>

class directory_iterator;

(filesystem TS)

directory_iterator is a LegacyInputIterator that iterates over the directory_entry elements of a directory (but does not visit the subdirectories). The iteration order is unspecified, except that each directory entry is visited only once. The special pathnames dot and dot-dot are skipped.

If the directory_iterator is advanced past the last directory entry, it becomes equal to the default-constructed iterator, also known as the end iterator. Two end iterators are always equal, dereferencing or incrementing the end iterator is undefined behavior.

If a file or a directory is deleted or added to the directory tree after the directory iterator has been created, it is unspecified whether the change would be observed through the iterator.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a directory iterator 
(public member function)

(destructor)

default destructor 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns contents 
(public member function)

operator*operator->

accesses the pointed-to entry 
(public member function)

incrementoperator++

advances to the next entry 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

filesystem::begin(filesystem::directory_iterator)filesystem::end(filesystem::directory_iterator)

range-based for loop support 
(function)

Additionally, operator== and operator!= are provided, either as members or as non-members, as required by LegacyInputIterator.

### Example

Run this code

#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
fs::create_directories("sandbox/a/b");
std::ofstream{"sandbox/file1.txt"};
std::ofstream{"sandbox/file2.txt"};
for (const fs::directory_entry& entry : fs::directory_iterator{"sandbox"})
std::cout << entry << '\n';
fs::remove_all("sandbox");
}

Possible output:

"sandbox/a"
"sandbox/file1.txt"
"sandbox/file2.txt"
