Defined in header <experimental/filesystem>

std::uintmax_t file_size( const path& p );

std::uintmax_t file_size( const path& p, error_code& ec );

(1)
(filesystem TS)

Returns the size of the regular file p, determined as if by reading the st_size member of the structure obtained by POSIX stat (symlinks are followed).

Attempting to determine the size of a directory (as well as any other file that is not a regular file or a symlink) is treated as an error.

The non-throwing overload returns returns -1 on errors.

### Parameters

p

-

path to examine

ec

-

out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload

### Return value

The size of the file, in bytes.

### Exceptions

The overload that does not take an error_code& parameter throws filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with p as the first argument and the OS error code as the error code argument. std::bad_alloc may be thrown if memory allocation fails. The overload taking an error_code& parameter sets it to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur. This overload has noexcept specification:  noexcept

### Example

Run this code

#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
fs::path p = fs::current_path() / "example.bin";
std::ofstream(p).put('a'); // create file of size 1
std::cout << "File size = " << fs::file_size(p) << '\n';
fs::remove(p);
 
try
{
fs::file_size("/dev"); // attempt to get size of a directory
}
catch (fs::filesystem_error& e)
{
std::cout << e.what() << '\n';
} 
}

Possible output:

File size = 1
filesystem error: cannot get file size: Is a directory [/dev]
