Finds the last character equal to any of the characters in the given character sequence.

1) Finds the last occurence of any of the characters of v in this view, starting at position pos.

2) Equivalent to find_last_of(basic_string_view(&c, 1), pos).

3) Equivalent to find_last_of(basic_string_view(s, count), pos).

4) Equivalent to find_last_of(basic_string_view(s), pos).

### Parameters

v

-

view to search for

pos

-

position at which to start the search

count

-

length of the string of characters to search for

s

-

pointer to a string of characters to search for

ch

-

character to search for

### Return value

Position of the last occurrence of any character of the substring, or npos if no such character is found.

### Complexity

O(size() * v.size()) at worst.
