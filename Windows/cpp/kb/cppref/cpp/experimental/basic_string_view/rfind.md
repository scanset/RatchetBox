Finds the last substring equal to the given character sequence.

1) Finds the last occurence of v in this view, starting at position pos.

2) Equivalent to rfind(basic_string_view(&c, 1), pos).

3) Equivalent to rfind(basic_string_view(s, count), pos).

4) Equivalent to rfind(basic_string_view(s), pos).

### Parameters

v

-

view to search for

pos

-

position at which to start the search

count

-

length of substring to search for

s

-

pointer to a character string to search for

ch

-

character to search for

### Return value

Position of the first character of the found substring or npos if no such substring is found.

### Complexity

O(size() * v.size()) at worst.
