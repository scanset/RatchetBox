constexpr const_pointer data() const noexcept;

(library fundamentals TS)

Returns a pointer to the underlying character array. The pointer is such that the range [data(), data() + size()) is valid and the values in it correspond to the values of the view. (n.b. Unlike basic_string::data() and string literals, data() may return a pointer to a buffer that is not null-terminated. Therefore it is typically a mistake to pass data() to a routine that takes just a const CharT* and expects a null-terminated string.)

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

A pointer to the underlying character array.
