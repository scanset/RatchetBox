(ranges TS)

The concept Copyable<T> specifies that T is an Movable object type that can also copied (that is, it supports copy construction and copy assignment).

### Notes

It is intended that Copyable<T> also requires Assignable<T&, const T> (assignment from const rvalue) and Assignable<T&, T&> (assignment from non-const lvalue) to be satisfied.
