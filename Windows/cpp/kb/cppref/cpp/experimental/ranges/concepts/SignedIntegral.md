template< class T >

concept bool SignedIntegral = Integral<T> && std::is_signed<T>::value;

(ranges TS)

The concept SignedIntegral<T> is satisfied if and only if T is an integral type and std::is_signed<T>::value is true.

There need not be any subsumption relationship between SignedIntegral<T> and std::is_signed<T>::value. 

### Notes

SignedIntegral<T> may be satisfied by a type that is not a signed integer type, for example, char (on a system where char is signed).
