template<>

struct less_equal<void>;

(ranges TS)

Function object for performing comparisons. The primary template invokes operator< on const lvalues of type T with the argument order inverted and then negates the result. The specialization less_equal<void> deduces the parameter types of the function call operator from the arguments (but not the return type).

All specializations of less_equal are Semiregular.

### Member functions

operator()

checks if the first argument is less than or equal to the second 
(public member function)

## std::experimental::ranges::less_equal::operator()

constexpr bool operator()(const T& x, const T& y) const;

(1)
(member only of primary less_equal<T> template)

template< class T, class U >

    requires StrictTotallyOrderedWith<T, U>

             /* std::declval<T>() < std::declval<U>() resolves to

                a built-in operator comparing pointers */

constexpr bool operator()(T&& t, U&& u) const;

(2)
(member only of less_equal<void> specialization)

1) Compares x and y. Equivalent to return !ranges::less<>{}(y, x);.

2) Compares t and u. Equivalent to return !ranges::less<>{}(std::forward<U>(u), std::forward<T>(t));.

### Notes

Unlike std::less_equal, ranges::less_equal requires all six comparison operators <, <=, >, >=, == and != to be valid (via the StrictTotallyOrdered and StrictTotallyOrderedWith constraints) and is entirely defined in terms of ranges::less. However, the implementation is free to use operator<= directly, because those concepts require the results of the comparison operators to be consistent.
