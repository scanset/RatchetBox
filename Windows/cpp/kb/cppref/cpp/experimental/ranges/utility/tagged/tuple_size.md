template< class Base, class... Tags >

struct tuple_size<std::experimental::ranges::tagged<Base, Tags...>>

: std::tuple_size<Base> {};

(ranges TS)

The partial specialization of std::tuple_size for tagged provides the ability to obtain the number of elements in a tagged object using tuple-like syntax. It simply forwards to std::tuple_size<Base>.

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

std::tuple_size<Base>::value 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator std::size_t

converts the object to std::size_t, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)
