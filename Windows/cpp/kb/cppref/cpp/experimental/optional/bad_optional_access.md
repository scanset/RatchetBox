Defined in header <experimental/optional>

class bad_optional_access;

(library fundamentals TS)

Defines a type of object to be thrown by std::experimental::optional::value when accessing an optional object that does not contain a value.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new bad_optional_access object 
(public member function)

operator=

replaces the bad_optional_access object 
(public member function)

what

returns the explanatory string 
(public member function)

## std::experimental::bad_optional_access::bad_optional_access

bad_optional_access() noexcept;

(1)
(library fundamentals TS)

bad_optional_access( const bad_optional_access& other ) noexcept;

(2)
(library fundamentals TS)

Constructs a new bad_optional_access object with an implementation-defined null-terminated byte string which is accessible through what().

1) Default constructor.

2) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::experimental::bad_optional_access then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0.

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to copy

## std::experimental::bad_optional_access::operator=

bad_optional_access& operator=( const bad_optional_access& other ) noexcept;

(library fundamentals TS)

Assigns the contents with those of other.If *this and other both have dynamic type std::experimental::bad_optional_access then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment.

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to assign with

### Return value

*this

## std::experimental::bad_optional_access::what

virtual const char* what() const noexcept;

(library fundamentals TS)

Returns the explanatory string.

### Return value

Pointer to an implementation-defined null-terminated string with explanatory information. The string is suitable for conversion and display as a std::wstring. The pointer is guaranteed to be valid at least until the exception object from which it is obtained is destroyed, or until a non-const member function (e.g. copy assignment operator) on the exception object is called.

The returned string is encoded with the ordinary literal encoding during constant evaluation.

(since C++26)

### Notes

Implementations are allowed but not required to override what().

## Inherited from std::logic_error 

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

(destructor)

[virtual]

destroys the exception object 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)
