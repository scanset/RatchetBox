template< class... Args > 

void emplace( Args&&... args );

(library fundamentals TS)

template< class U, class... Args > 

void emplace( std::initializer_list<U> ilist, Args&&... args );

(library fundamentals TS)

Constructs the contained value in-place. If *this already contains a value before the call, the contained value is destroyed by calling its destructor.

1) Initializes the contained value by direct-initializing (but not direct-list-initializing) with std::forward<Args>(args)... as parameters.

2) Initializes the contained value by calling its constructor with ilist, std::forward<Args>(args)... as parameters. This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_constructible<T, std::initializer_list<U>&, Args&&...>::value is true.

### Parameters

args...

-

the arguments to pass to the constructor

ilist

-

the initializer list to pass to the constructor

Type requirements

-

T must be constructible from Args...

-

T must be constructible from std::initializer_list and Args...

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown by the selected constructor of T. If an exception is thrown, *this does not contain a value after this call (the previously contained value, if any, had been destroyed).
