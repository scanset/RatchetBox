Creates a shared state of type V that is immediately ready, with the result constructed from std::forward<T>(value), then returns a std::experimental::future associated with that shared state.

2) Creates a shared state of type void that is immediately ready, then returns a std::experimental::future associated with that shared state.

### Return value
