(library fundamentals TS)

The struct std::experimental::pmr::pool_options contains a set of constructor options for std::experimental::pmr::synchronized_pool_resource and std::experimental::pmr::unsynchronized_pool_resource.

### Data members

std::size_t max_blocks_per_chunk

the maximum number of blocks that will be allocated at once from the upstream memory resource to replenish a pool 
(public member object)

std::size_t largest_required_pool_block

the largest allocation size that is required to be fulfilled through the pooling mechanism 
(public member object)

If the value of max_blocks_per_chunk is zero or greater than an implementation-defined limit, that limit is used instead. The implementation may use a smaller value than is specified and may use different values for different pools.

If the value of largest_required_pool_block is zero or greater than an implementation-defined limit, that limit is used instead. The implementation may use a threshold greater than specified in this field.
