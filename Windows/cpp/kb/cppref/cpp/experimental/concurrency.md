The C++ Extensions for Concurrency, ISO/IEC TS 19571:2016, defines the following new components for the C++ standard library:

### Continuations and other extensions for std::future

Defined in header <experimental/future> 

future

(concurrency TS)

a version of std::future enhanced with continuations and other features 
(class template)

shared_future

(concurrency TS)

a version of std::shared_future enhanced with continuations and other features 
(class template)

promise

(concurrency TS)

a modified version of std::promise that uses std::experimental::future 
(class template)

packaged_task

(concurrency TS)

a modified version of std::packaged_task that uses std::experimental::future 
(class template)

when_all

(concurrency TS)

produces a future that becomes ready when all given futures or shared_futures are ready 
(function template)

when_any

(concurrency TS)

produces a future that becomes ready when at least one of the given futures or shared_futures is ready 
(function template)

make_ready_future

(concurrency TS)

produces a future that is ready immediately and holds the given value 
(function template)

make_exceptional_future

(concurrency TS)

produces a future that is ready immediately and holds the given exception 
(function template)

### Feature test macros

Defined in header <experimental/future> 

__cpp_lib_experimental_future_continuations

a value of at least 201505 indicates that future::then and other extensions are supported 
(macro constant)

Defined in header <experimental/latch> 

__cpp_lib_experimental_latch

a value of at least 201505 indicates that the latch type is supported 
(macro constant)

Defined in header <experimental/barrier> 

__cpp_lib_experimental_barrier

a value of at least 201505 indicates that barrier type is supported 
(macro constant)

Defined in header <experimental/atomic> 

__cpp_lib_experimental_atomic_smart_pointers

a value of at least 201505 indicates that the atomic smart pointers are supported 
(macro constant)

## Merged into C++20

The following components of the Concurrency TS have been adopted into the C++20 standard.

### Latches and barriers

Defined in header <experimental/latch> 

latch

(concurrency TS)

single-use thread barrier 
(class)

Defined in header <experimental/barrier> 

barrier

(concurrency TS)

reusable thread barrier 
(class)

flex_barrier

(concurrency TS)

reusable thread barrier with customizable behavior on completion 
(class)

### Atomic smart pointers

These class templates replace the shared_ptr atomic function overloads

Defined in header <experimental/atomic> 

atomic_shared_ptr

(concurrency TS)

atomic version of std::shared_ptr 
(class template)

atomic_weak_ptr

(concurrency TS)

atomic version of std::weak_ptr 
(class template)
