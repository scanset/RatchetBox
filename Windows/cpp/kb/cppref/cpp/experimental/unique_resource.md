class unique_resource;

(library fundamentals TS v3)

unique_resource is universal RAII wrapper for resource handles that owns and manages a resource through a handle and disposes of that resource when the unique_resource is destroyed.

The resource is disposed of using the deleter of type D when either of the following happens:

- the managing unique_resource object is destroyed,

- the managing unique_resource object is assigned from another resource via operator= or reset().

Let type RS be R if R is an object type, or std::reference_wrapper<std::remove_reference_t<R>> otherwise:

- unique_resource effectively holds a subobject of type RS which is or wraps the resource handle, a deleter of type D and a bool flag indicating whether the wrapper is owning the resource.

- For explanatory purpose, the subobject of type RS is called stored resource handle, and the stored (if R is an object type) or wrapped (if R is a reference type) R is called underlying resource handle. These two terms are not used by the LFTS.

### Template parameters

R

-

resource handle type

D

-

deleter type

Type requirements

-

R shall be an object type or an lvalue reference to an object type. Let UnrefR be std::remove_reference_t<R>, UnrefR shall be MoveConstructible, and if UnrefR is not CopyConstructible, std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<UnrefR> shall be true.

-

D shall be a Destructible and MoveConstructible FunctionObject type, and if D is not CopyConstructible, std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<D> shall be true. Given an lvalue d of type D and an lvalue r of type UnrefR, the expression d(r) shall be well-formed.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new unique_resource 
(public member function)

(destructor)

disposes the managed resource if such is present 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns a unique_resource 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

release

releases the ownership 
(public member function)

reset

disposes or replaces the managed resource 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

get

accesses the underlying resource handle 
(public member function)

get_deleter

accesses the deleter used for disposing of the managed resource 
(public member function)

operator*operator->

accesses the pointee if the resource handle is a pointer 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

make_unique_resource_checked

creates a unique_resource, checking invalid value 
(function template)

### Deduction guides

### Notes

Resource handle types satisfying NullablePointer can also be managed by std::unique_ptr. Unlike unique_ptr, unique_resource does not require NullablePointer.
