(3)

Converts the calendar date and time stored in the std::tm object pointed to by t into a character string, according to the format string [fmtbeg, fmtend). The format string is the same as used by std::strftime, but each format specifier is processed by an individual call to do_put(), which can be customized by extending this facet.

1) Steps through the character sequence [fmtbeg, fmtend), examining the characters. Every character that is not a part of a format sequence is written to the output iterator out immediately. To identify format sequences, this function narrows the next character c in [fmtbeg, fmtend) as if by std::ctype<char_type>(str.getloc()).narrow(c, 0) and if it equals '%', the next one or two characters are compared to the list of format sequences recognized by std::strftime plus any additional implementation-defined formats supported by this locale. For each valid format sequence, a call to do_put(out, str, fill, t, format, modifier) is made, where format is the format sequence character, and modifier is the optional format sequence modifier ('E' or 'O'). A value of '\0' is used if the modifier is absent.

2) Calls the do_put member function of the most derived class.

3) Converts the calendar date and time stored in the std::tm object pointed to by t into a character string, according to the format conversion sequence formed by concatenating '%', the value of modifier if not '\0', and the value of format. The format is interpreted the same way as the function std::strftime, except that the formats that are described as locale-dependent are defined by this locale, and additional format specifiers may be supported (the fill argument is provided for these implementation-defined format specifiers to use). The string is written to the output iterator out.

### Parameters

out

-

output iterator where the result of the conversion is written

str

-

a stream object that this function uses to obtain locale facets when needed, e.g. std::ctype to narrow characters

t

-

pointer to the std::tm object from which the date/time values are obtained

fmtbeg

-

pointer to the first character of a sequence of char_type characters specifying the conversion format

fmtend

-

pointer one past the last character of a sequence of char_type characters specifying the conversion format

fill

-

fill character (usually space)

format

-

the character that names a conversion specifier

modifier

-

the optional modifier that may appear between % and the conversion specifier

### Format string

The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers and ordinary characters (except %). All ordinary characters, including the terminating null character, are copied to the output string without modification. Each conversion specification begins with % character, optionally followed by E or O modifier (ignored if unsupported by the locale), followed by the character that determines the behavior of the specifier. The following format specifiers are available:

### Return value

Iterator pointing one past the last character that was produced.

### Notes

No error handling is provided.

The fill character is provided for those implementation-defined format specifiers and for the user-defined overrides of do_put() that use padding and filling logic. Such implementations typically make use of the formatting flags from str.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <ctime>
 
void try_time_put(const std::tm* t, const std::string& fmt)
{
std::cout.imbue(std::locale());
std::cout << "In the locale '" << std::cout.getloc().name() << "' : '";
 
std::use_facet<std::time_put<char>>(std::cout.getloc()).put(
{std::cout}, std::cout, ' ', t, &fmt[0], &fmt[0] + fmt.size());
 
std::cout << "'\n";
}
 
int main()
{
std::time_t t = std::time(NULL);
std::tm tm = *std::localtime(&t);
 
std::string fmt = "%c";
std::cout << "Using the format string '" << fmt
<< "' to format the time: " << std::ctime(&t) << '\n';
 
std::locale::global(std::locale("de_DE.utf8"));
try_time_put(&tm, fmt);
 
std::locale::global(std::locale("el_GR.utf8"));
try_time_put(&tm, fmt);
 
std::locale::global(std::locale("ja_JP.utf8"));
try_time_put(&tm, fmt);
}

Possible output:

Using the format string '%c' to format the time: Mon Feb 11 22:58:50 2013
 
In the locale 'de_DE.utf8' : 'Mo 11 Feb 2013 23:02:38 EST'
In the locale 'el_GR.utf8' : 'Δευ 11 Φεβ 2013 11:02:38 μμ EST'
In the locale 'ja_JP.utf8' : '2013年02月11日 23時02分38秒'
