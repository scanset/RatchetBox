: public std::codecvt<Elem, char, std::mbstate_t>;

(since C++11) 
(deprecated in C++17) 
(removed in C++26)

std::codecvt_utf8 is a std::codecvt facet which encapsulates conversion between a UTF-8 encoded byte string and UCS-2 or UTF-32 character string (depending on the type of Elem). This std::codecvt facet can be used to read and write UTF-8 files, both text and binary.

UCS-2 is an archaic encoding that is a subset of UTF-16, which encodes scalar values in the range U+0000-U+FFFF (Basic Multilingual Plane) only.

### Template Parameters

Elem

-

either char16_t, char32_t, or wchar_t

Maxcode

-

the largest value of Elem that this facet will read or write without error

Mode

-

a constant of type std::codecvt_mode

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new codecvt_utf8 facet 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destroys a codecvt_utf8 facet 
(public member function)

## std::codecvt_utf8::codecvt_utf8

explicit codecvt_utf8( std::size_t refs = 0 );

Constructs a new std::codecvt_utf8 facet, passes the initial reference counter refs to the base class.

### Parameters

refs

-

the number of references that link to the facet

## std::codecvt_utf8::~codecvt_utf8

~codecvt_utf8();

Destroys the facet. Unlike the locale-managed facets, this facet's destructor is public.

### Protected member functions

do_out

[virtual]

converts a string from InternT to ExternT, such as when writing to file 
(virtual protected member function of std::codecvt<InternT,ExternT,StateT>)

do_in

[virtual]

converts a string from ExternT to InternT, such as when reading from file 
(virtual protected member function of std::codecvt<InternT,ExternT,StateT>)

do_unshift

[virtual]

generates the termination character sequence of ExternT characters for incomplete conversion 
(virtual protected member function of std::codecvt<InternT,ExternT,StateT>)

do_encoding

[virtual]

returns the number of ExternT characters necessary to produce one InternT character, if constant 
(virtual protected member function of std::codecvt<InternT,ExternT,StateT>)

do_always_noconv

[virtual]

tests if the facet encodes an identity conversion for all valid argument values 
(virtual protected member function of std::codecvt<InternT,ExternT,StateT>)

do_length

[virtual]

calculates the length of the ExternT string that would be consumed by conversion into given InternT buffer 
(virtual protected member function of std::codecvt<InternT,ExternT,StateT>)

do_max_length

[virtual]

returns the maximum number of ExternT characters that could be converted into a single InternT character 
(virtual protected member function of std::codecvt<InternT,ExternT,StateT>)

## Inherited from std::codecvt_base

Nested type

Definition

enum result { ok, partial, error, noconv };

Unscoped enumeration type

Enumeration constant

Definition

ok

conversion was completed with no error

partial

not all source characters were converted

error

encountered an invalid character

noconv

no conversion required, input and output types are the same

### Notes

Although the standard requires that this facet works with UCS-2 when the size of Elem is 16 bits, some implementations use UTF-16 instead. The term "UCS-2" was deprecated and removed from ISO 10646.

### Example

The following example demonstrates the difference between UCS-2/UTF-8 and UTF-16/UTF-8 conversions: the third character in the string is not a valid UCS-2 character.

Run this code

#include <codecvt>
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
// UTF-8 data. The character U+1d10b, musical sign segno, does not fit in UCS-2
std::string utf8 = "z\u6c34\U0001d10b";
 
// the UTF-8 / UTF-16 standard conversion facet
std::wstring_convert<std::codecvt_utf8_utf16<char16_t>, char16_t> utf16conv;
std::u16string utf16 = utf16conv.from_bytes(utf8);
std::cout << "UTF-16 conversion produced " << utf16.size() << " code units:\n"
<< std::showbase << std::hex;
for (char16_t c : utf16)
std::cout << static_cast<std::uint16_t>(c) << ' ';
 
// the UTF-8 / UCS-2 standard conversion facet
std::wstring_convert<std::codecvt_utf8<char16_t>, char16_t> ucs2conv;
try
{
std::u16string ucs2 = ucs2conv.from_bytes(utf8);
}
catch(const std::range_error& e)
{
std::u16string ucs2 = ucs2conv.from_bytes(utf8.substr(0, ucs2conv.converted()));
std::cout << "\nUCS-2 failed after producing " << std::dec << ucs2.size()
<< " characters:\n" << std::showbase << std::hex;
for (char16_t c : ucs2)
std::cout << static_cast<std::uint16_t>(c) << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}
}

Output:

UTF-16 conversion produced 4 code units:
0x7a 0x6c34 0xd834 0xdd0b
UCS-2 failed after producing 2 characters:
0x7a 0x6c34
