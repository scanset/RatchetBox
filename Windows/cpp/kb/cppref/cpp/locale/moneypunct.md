template< class CharT, bool International = false >

class moneypunct;

The facet std::moneypunct encapsulates monetary value format preferences. Stream I/O manipulators std::get_money and std::put_money use std::moneypunct through std::money_get and std::money_put for parsing monetary value input and formatting monetary value output.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale object):

Defined in header <locale> 

std::moneypunct<char>

provides equivalents of the "C" locale preferences

std::moneypunct<wchar_t>

provides wide character equivalents of the "C" locale preferences

std::moneypunct<char, true>

provides equivalents of the "C" locale preferences, with international currency symbols

std::moneypunct<wchar_t, true>

provides wide character equivalents of the "C" locale preferences, with international currency symbols
