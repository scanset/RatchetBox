> class money_put;

Class std::money_put encapsulates the rules for formatting monetary values as strings. The standard I/O manipulator std::put_money uses the std::money_put facet of the I/O stream's locale.

Inheritance diagram

If a std::money_put specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by the standard library (see below), the behaviors of its put() and do_put() are not guaranteed as specified.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale object):

Defined in header <locale> 

std::money_put<char>

creates narrow string representations of monetary values

std::money_put<wchar_t>

creates wide string representations of monetary values

In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every specialization that satisfies the following type requirements:

- CharT is one of
char,

- wchar_t, and

- any other implementation-defined character container type that meets the requirements for a character on which any of the iostream components can be instantiated; and

- OutputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator.

### Data members

Member

Description

std::locale::id id [static]

the identifier of the facet

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new money_put facet 
(public member function)

put

invokes do_put 
(public member function)

### Protected member functions

(destructor)

destructs a money_put facet 
(protected member function)

do_put

[virtual]

formats a monetary value and writes to output stream 
(virtual protected member function)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
// using the I/O manipulator
std::cout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
std::cout << "American locale: "
<< std::showbase << std::put_money(12345678.9) << '\n';
 
// using the facet directly
std::cout.imbue(std::locale("de_DE.UTF-8"));
std::cout << "German locale: ";
auto& f = std::use_facet<std::money_put<char>>(std::cout.getloc());
f.put({std::cout}, false, std::cout, std::cout.fill(), 12345678.9);
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

American locale: $123,456.79
German locale: 123.456,79 €

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

LWG 427

C++98

money_put was guaranteed to accept any CharT that
meets the requirements for a character on which
any of the iostream components can be instantiated

only guarantees to accept char,
wchar_t and other implementation-
defined character types

LWG 2392

C++98

only character type CharT could be
guaranteed to be accepted by money_put

can guarantee to accept implementation-
defined character container types
