Defined in header <locale>

class locale;

An object of class std::locale is an immutable indexed set of immutable facets. Each stream object of the C++ input/output library is associated with an std::locale object and uses its facets for parsing and formatting of all data. In addition, a locale object is associated with each std::basic_regex object.(since C++11) Locale objects can also be used as predicates that perform string collation with the standard containers and algorithms and can be accessed directly to obtain or modify the facets they hold.

Each locale constructed in a C++ program holds at least the following standard facets (i.e. std::has_facet returns true for all these facet types), but a program may define additional specializations or completely new facets and add them to any existing locale object. 

Supported facets

std::ctype<char>
std::ctype<wchar_t>

std::codecvt<char, char, std::mbstate_t>
std::codecvt<wchar_t, char, std::mbstate_t>

std::num_get<char>
std::num_get<wchar_t>

std::numpunct<char>
std::numpunct<wchar_t>

std::num_put<char>
std::num_put<wchar_t>

std::money_get<char>
std::money_get<wchar_t>

std::moneypunct<char>
std::moneypunct<char, true>
std::moneypunct<wchar_t>
std::moneypunct<wchar_t, true>

std::money_put<char>
std::money_put<wchar_t>

std::time_get<char>
std::time_get<wchar_t>

std::collate<char>
std::collate<wchar_t>

std::time_put<char>
std::time_put<wchar_t>

std::messages<char>
std::messages<wchar_t>

Deprecated facets

std::codecvt<char16_t, char, std::mbstate_t> (since C++11)(deprecated in C++20)
std::codecvt<char32_t, char, std::mbstate_t> (since C++11)(deprecated in C++20)
std::codecvt<char16_t, char8_t, std::mbstate_t> (since C++20)(deprecated)
std::codecvt<char32_t, char8_t, std::mbstate_t> (since C++20)(deprecated)

Internally, a locale object is implemented as if it is a reference-counted pointer to an array (indexed by std::locale::id) of reference-counted pointers to facets: copying a locale only copies one pointer and increments several reference counts. To maintain the standard C++ library thread safety guarantees (operations on different objects are always thread-safe), both the locale reference count and each facet reference count are updated in a thread-safe manner, similar to std::shared_ptr.

### Member types

Type

Description

id

the facet index type: each facet class must declare or inherit a public static member of this type 
(class)

facet

the base class for all facet categories: each facet of any category is derived from this type 
(class)

category

int 
(typedef)

### Member constants

Name

Explanation

const category none

[static]

a zero value indicating no facet category 
(public static member constant)

const category collate

[static]

a bitmask value indicating the collate facet category 
(public static member constant)

const category ctype

[static]

a bitmask value indicating the ctype facet category 
(public static member constant)

const category monetary

[static]

a bitmask value indicating the monetary facet category 
(public static member constant)

const category numeric

[static]

a bitmask value indicating the numeric facet category 
(public static member constant)

const category time

[static]

a bitmask value indicating the time facet category 
(public static member constant)

const category messages

[static]

a bitmask value indicating the messages facet category 
(public static member constant)

const category all

[static]

collate | ctype | monetary | numeric | time | messages 
(public static member constant)

std::locale member functions expecting a category argument require one of the category values defined above, or the union of two or more such values. The LC constants are not accepted.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new locale 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destructs the locale and the facets whose reference count becomes zero 
(public member function)

operator=

replaces a locale 
(public member function)

combine

constructs a locale with compile-time identified facet copied from another locale 
(public member function)

name

returns the name of the locale or "*" if unnamed 
(public member function)

encoding

(C++26)

returns the character encoding scheme associated with the locale 
(public member function)

operator==operator!=

(removed in C++20)

equality comparison between locale objects 
(public member function)

operator()

lexicographically compares two strings using this locale's collate facet 
(public member function)

global

[static]

changes the global locale 
(public static member function)

classic

[static]

obtains a reference to the "C" locale 
(public static member function)

### Example

Demonstrates the typical prologue of a locale-sensitive program (cross-platform).

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
std::wcout << L"User-preferred locale setting is "
<< std::locale("").name().c_str() << L'\n';
// on startup, the global locale is the "C" locale
std::wcout << 1000.01 << L'\n';
 
// replace the C++ global locale and the "C" locale with the user-preferred locale
std::locale::global(std::locale(""));
// use the new global locale for future wide character output
std::wcout.imbue(std::locale());
 
// output the same number again
std::wcout << 1000.01 << L'\n';
}

Possible output:

User-preferred locale setting is en_US.UTF8
1000.01
1,000.01
