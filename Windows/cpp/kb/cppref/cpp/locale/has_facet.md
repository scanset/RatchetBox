Defined in header <locale>

template< class Facet >

bool has_facet( const locale& loc ) throw();

(until C++11)

template< class Facet >

bool has_facet( const locale& loc ) noexcept;

(since C++11)

Checks if the locale loc implements the facet Facet.

The program is ill-formed if Facet is not a facet or it is a volatile-qualified facet.

### Parameters

loc

-

the locale object to query

### Return value

Returns true if the facet Facet was installed in the locale loc, false otherwise.

### Notes

std::has_facet must return true for all locales loc if Facet is one of the standard facets given here.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
// minimal custom facet
struct myfacet : public std::locale::facet
{
static std::locale::id id;
};
 
std::locale::id myfacet::id;
 
int main()
{
// loc is a "C" locale with myfacet added
std::locale loc(std::locale::classic(), new myfacet);
std::cout << std::boolalpha
<< "Can loc classify chars? "
<< std::has_facet<std::ctype<char>>(loc) << '\n'
<< "Can loc classify char32_t? "
<< std::has_facet<std::ctype<char32_t>>(loc) << '\n'
<< "Does loc implement myfacet? "
<< std::has_facet<myfacet>(loc) << '\n';
}

Output:

Can loc classify chars? true
Can loc classify char32_t? false
Does loc implement myfacet? true
