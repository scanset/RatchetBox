Defined in header <locale>

const char* scan_is( mask m, const char* beg, const char* end ) const;

(1)

Locates the first character in the character array [beg, end) that satisfies the classification mask m, that is, the first character c such that table()[(unsigned char) c] & m would return true.

If (unsigned char)c >= std::ctype<char>::table_size, then an implementation-defined value is substituted instead of table()[(unsigned char)c], possibly different for different values of c.

### Parameters

m

-

mask to search for

beg

-

pointer to the first character in an array of characters to search

end

-

one past the end pointer for the array of characters to search

### Return value

Pointer to the first character in [beg, end) that satisfies the mask, or end if no such character was found.

### Notes

Unlike the primary template std::ctype, this specialization does not perform a virtual function call when classifying characters. To customize the behavior, a derived class may provide a non-default classification table to the base class constructor.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
std::locale loc("");
auto& f = std::use_facet<std::ctype<char>>(loc);
 
// skip until the first letter
char s1[] = " \t\t\n Test";
const char* p1 = f.scan_is(std::ctype_base::alpha, std::begin(s1), std::end(s1));
std::cout << '\'' << p1 << "'\n";
 
// skip until the first letter
char s2[] = "123456789abcd";
const char* p2 = f.scan_is(std::ctype_base::alpha, std::begin(s2), std::end(s2));
std::cout << '\'' << p2 << "'\n";
}

Output:

'Test'
'abcd'
