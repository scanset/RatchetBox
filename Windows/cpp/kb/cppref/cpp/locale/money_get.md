> class money_get;

Class template std::money_get encapsulates the rules for parsing monetary values from character streams. The standard I/O manipulator std::get_money uses the std::money_get facet of the I/O stream's locale.

Inheritance diagram

If a std::money_get specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by the standard library (see below), the behaviors of its get() and do_get() are not guaranteed as specified.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale object):

Defined in header <locale> 

std::money_get<char>

parses narrow string representations of monetary values

std::money_get<wchar_t>

parses wide string representations of monetary values

In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every specialization that satisfies the following type requirements:

- CharT is one of
char,

- wchar_t, and

- any other implementation-defined character container type that meets the requirements for a character on which any of the iostream components can be instantiated; and

- InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

### Data members

Member

Description

std::locale::id id [static]

the identifier of the facet

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new money_get facet 
(public member function)

get

invokes do_get 
(public member function)

### Protected member functions

(destructor)

destructs a money_get facet 
(protected member function)

do_get

[virtual]

parses a monetary value from an input stream 
(virtual protected member function)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <locale>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
std::string str = "$1.11 $2.22 $3.33";
std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(2);
 
std::cout << '\"' << str << "\" parsed with the I/O manipulator: ";
std::istringstream s1(str);
s1.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
 
long double val;
while (s1 >> std::get_money(val))
std::cout << val / 100 << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
 
str = "USD 1,234.56";
std::cout << '\"' << str << "\" parsed with the facet directly: ";
std::istringstream s2(str);
s2.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
 
auto& f = std::use_facet<std::money_get<char>>(s2.getloc());
std::ios_base::iostate err;
std::istreambuf_iterator<char> beg(s2), end;
f.get(beg, end, true, s2, err, val);
 
std::cout << val / 100 << '\n';
}

Output:

"$1.11 $2.22 $3.33" parsed with the I/O manipulator: 1.11 2.22 3.33
"USD 1,234.56" parsed with the facet directly: 1234.56

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

LWG 427

C++98

money_get was guaranteed to accept any CharT that
meets the requirements for a character on which
any of the iostream components can be instantiated

only guarantees to accept char,
wchar_t and other implementation-
defined character types

LWG 2392

C++98

only character type CharT could be
guaranteed to be accepted by money_get

can guarantee to accept implementation-
defined character container types
