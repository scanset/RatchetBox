explicit facet( std::size_t refs = 0 );

(1)

facet( const facet& ) = delete;

(2)

1) Creates a facet with starting reference count refs. If refs is non-zero, the facet will not be deleted when the last locale referencing it goes out of scope. A facet with static or dynamic storage duration should always be constructed with a non-zero refs.

2) Copy constructor is deleted; std::locale::facet is not copyable.
