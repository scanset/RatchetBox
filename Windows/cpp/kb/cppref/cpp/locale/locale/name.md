Defined in header <locale>

std::string name() const;

Returns the name of the locale, which is the name by which it is known to the operating system, such as "POSIX" or "en_US.UTF8" or "English_United States.1252". If the locale is not a copy of a system-supplied locale, the string "*" is returned.

### Return value

The name of the locale or "*" if unnamed.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::locale loc(std::locale(), new std::ctype<char>);
std::cout << "The default locale is " << std::locale().name() << '\n'
<< "The user's locale is " << std::locale("").name() << '\n'
<< "A nameless locale is " << loc.name() << '\n';
}

Possible output:

The default locale is C
The user's locale is en_US.UTF8
A nameless locale is *
