static locale global( const locale& loc );

Replaces the global C++ locale with loc, which means all future calls to the std::locale default constructor will now return a copy of loc. If loc has a name, also replaces the C locale as if by std::setlocale(LC_ALL, loc.name().c_str());. This function is the only way to modify the global C++ locale, which is otherwise equivalent to std::locale::classic() at program startup.
