template< class Facet >

locale combine( const locale& other ) const;

Constructs a locale object which is a copy of *this except for the facet of type Facet, which is copied from other.

The program is ill-formed if Facet is not a facet or it is a volatile-qualified facet.

### Return value

The new, nameless, locale.

### Exceptions

std::runtime_error if other does not implement Facet.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
const double number = 1000.25;
std::cout << "\"C\" locale: " << number << '\n';
std::locale loc = std::locale()
.combine<std::numpunct<char>>(std::locale("en_US.UTF8"));
std::cout.imbue(loc);
std::cout << "\"C\" locale with en_US numpunct: " << number << '\n';
}

Output:

"C" locale: 1000.25
"C" locale with en_US numpunct: 1,000.25

Correct behavior

LWG 14

locale::combine was non-const

made const

LWG 436

C++98

it was unclear whether Facet can be cv-qualified

it can be const-qualified, but not volatile-qualified
