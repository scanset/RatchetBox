class numpunct;

The facet std::numpunct encapsulates numeric punctuation preferences. Stream I/O operations use std::numpunct through std::num_get and std::num_put for parsing numeric input and formatting numeric output. 

The numbers that are supported by std::numpunct have the format described below. Here digit represents the radix set specified by the fmtflags argument value, thousands-sep and decimal-point are the results of thousands_sep() and decimal_point() functions respectively.

The format of integer values is as follows:

integer  ::= [sign] units
sign  ::= plusminus
plusminus  ::= '+' | '-'
units  ::= digits [thousands-sep units]
digits  ::= digit [digits]

The number of digits between the thousand-seps (maximum size of digits) is specified by the result of grouping().

The format of floating-point values is as follows:

floatval  ::= [sign] units [decimal-point [digits]] [e [sign] digits]
[sign] decimal-point digits [e [sign] digits]
e  ::= 'e' | 'E'

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale object):

Defined in header <locale> 

std::numpunct<char>

provides equivalents of the "C" locale preferences

std::numpunct<wchar_t>

provides wide character equivalents of the "C" locale preferences

### Data members

Member

Description

std::locale::id id [static]

the identifier of the facet

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new numpunct facet 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destructs a numpunct facet 
(protected member function)

decimal_point

invokes do_decimal_point 
(public member function)

thousands_sep

invokes do_thousands_sep 
(public member function)

grouping

invokes do_grouping 
(public member function)

truenamefalsename

invokes do_truename or do_falsename 
(public member function)

### Protected member functions

do_decimal_point

[virtual]

provides the character to use as decimal point 
(virtual protected member function)

do_thousands_sep

[virtual]

provides the character to use as thousands separator 
(virtual protected member function)

do_grouping

[virtual]

provides the numbers of digits between each pair of thousands separators 
(virtual protected member function)

do_truenamedo_falsename

[virtual]

provides the string to use as the name of the boolean true and false 
(virtual protected member function)

### Example

The following example changes the string representations of true and false:

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
struct french_bool : std::numpunct<char>
{
string_type do_truename() const override { return "vrai"; }
string_type do_falsename() const override { return "faux"; }
};
 
int main()
{
std::cout << "default locale: "
<< std::boolalpha << true << ", " << false << '\n';
std::cout.imbue(std::locale(std::cout.getloc(), new french_bool));
std::cout << "locale with modified numpunct: "
<< std::boolalpha << true << ", " << false << '\n';
}

Output:

default locale: true, false
locale with modified numpunct: vrai, faux
