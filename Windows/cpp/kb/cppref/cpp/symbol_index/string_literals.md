This page tries to list all the symbols that are available from the standard library in the namespace std::literals::string_literals. The symbols are written as follows:

- Function names with ().

- Templates with <>.

### Notes

These operators are declared in the namespace std::literals::string_literals, where both literals and string_literals are inline namespaces. Access to these operators can be gained with:

- using namespace std::literals,

- using namespace std::string_literals, or

- using namespace std::literals::string_literals.

std::chrono::duration also defines operator""s to represent literal seconds, but it is an arithmetic literal: 10.0s and 10s are ten seconds, but "10"s is a string.
