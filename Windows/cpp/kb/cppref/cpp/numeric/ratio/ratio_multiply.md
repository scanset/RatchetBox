Defined in header <ratio>

template< class R1, class R2 >

using ratio_multiply = /* see below */;

(since C++11)

The alias template std::ratio_multiply denotes the result of multiplying two exact rational fractions represented by the std::ratio specializations R1 and R2.

The result is a std::ratio specialization std::ratio<U, V>, such that given Num == R1::num * R2::num and Denom == R1::den * R2::den (computed without arithmetic overflow), U is std::ratio<Num, Denom>::num and V is std::ratio<Num, Denom>::den.

### Notes

If U or V is not representable in std::intmax_t, the program is ill-formed. If Num or Denom is not representable in std::intmax_t, the program is ill-formed unless the implementation yields correct values for U and V.

The above definition requires that the result of std::ratio_multiply<R1, R2> be already reduced to lowest terms; for example, std::ratio_multiply<std::ratio<1, 6>, std::ratio<4, 5>> is the same type as std::ratio<2, 15>.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <ratio>
 
int main()
{
using two_third = std::ratio<2, 3>;
using one_sixth = std::ratio<1, 6>;
using product = std::ratio_multiply<two_third, one_sixth>;
static_assert(std::ratio_equal_v<product, std::ratio<13, 117>>);
std::cout << "2/3 * 1/6 = " << product::num << '/' << product::den << '\n';
}

Output:

2/3 * 1/6 = 1/9
