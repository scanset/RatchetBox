Defined in header <ratio>

template< class R1, class R2 >

struct ratio_greater_equal : std::integral_constant<bool, /* see below */> { };

(since C++11)

If the ratio R1 is greater than or equal to the ratio R2, provides the member constant value equal true. Otherwise, value is false.

### Helper variable template

template< class R1, class R2 >

constexpr bool ratio_greater_equal_v = ratio_greater_equal<R1, R2>::value;

(since C++17)

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

true if R1::num * R2::den >= R2::num * R1::den, or equivalent expression that avoids overflow, false otherwise 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator bool

converts the object to bool, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)

### Example

Run this code

#include <ratio>
 
int main()
{
static_assert(std::ratio_greater_equal<
std::ratio<2, 3>,
std::ratio<2, 3>>::value, "2/3 >= 2/3");
 
// since C++17
static_assert(std::ratio_greater_equal_v<
std::ratio<999'998, 999'999>,
std::ratio<999'997, 999'998>>);
}
