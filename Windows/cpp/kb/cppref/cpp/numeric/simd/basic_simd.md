class basic_simd;

(1)
(since C++26)

template< class T, /*simd-size-type*/ N = /*simd-size-v*/<T, /*native-abi*/<T>> >

(since C++26)

1) std::basic_simd specialization is a data-parallel type. The default ABI tag is determined by the implementation at compile-time.

2) std::simd is an alias template that allows users to specify the width to a certain size. The default width is determined by the implementation at compile-time.

Every specialization of basic_simd is a complete type. The specialization is

- enabled, if T is a vectorizable type, and there exists value M in the range [1, 64] such that Abi is deduce-abi-t<T, M>,

- otherwise disabled, if T is not a vectorizable type,

- otherwise, it is implementation-defined if such specialization is enabled.

If basic_simd<T, Abi> is disabled, the specialization has all deleted default constructor, destructor, copy constructor, and copy assignment. In addition, only the member types below are present.

If basic_simd<T, Abi> is enabled, basic_simd<T, Abi> is TriviallyCopyable.

### Template parameters

T

-

element type; a vectorizable type

Abi

-

tag type used to determine the width and storage

N

-

the width of the data-parallel type; the number of elements

### Member types

### Member constant

constexpr std::integral_constant<simd-size-type, simd-size-v<T, Abi>> size

[static]

(public static member constant)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a basic_simd object 
(public member function)

operator[]

accesses specified element 
(public member function)

operator++operator++(int)operator--operator--(int)

element-wise increment and decrement 
(public member function)

operator!operator~operator+operator-

element-wise unary operators 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

(function)

operator+=operator-=operator*=operator/=operator%=operator&=operator|=operator^=operator<<=operator>>=

element-wise compound binary operators 
(function)

operator==operator!=operator>=operator<=operator>operator<

(C++26)

element-wise relational operators 
(function)

(C++26)

(exposition-only function*)

### Deduction guide

template< class R, class... Ts >

basic_simd( R&& r, Ts... ) -> /* see below */;

(since C++26)

The deduction guide is present only if:

- R models contiguous_range and sized_range, and

- ranges::size(r) is a constant expression.

The deduced type is equivalent to std::simd<ranges::range_value_t<R>, ranges::size(r)>.

### Notes

Implementations are recommended to support explicit conversions between enabled specializations of basic_simd and appropriate implementation-defined types. These appropriate types are non-standard vector types which are available in the implementation.
