Each of these macro constants expands to a nonnegative integer constant expression, which can be used with std::fesetround and std::fegetround to indicate one of the supported floating-point rounding modes. The implementation may define additional rounding mode constants in <cfenv>, which should all begin with FE_ followed by at least one uppercase letter. Each macro is only defined if it is supported.

Constant

Explanation

FE_DOWNWARD

rounding towards negative infinity

FE_TONEAREST

rounding towards nearest representable value

FE_TOWARDZERO

rounding towards zero

FE_UPWARD

rounding towards positive infinity

Additional rounding modes may be supported by an implementation.

The current rounding mode affects the following:

- results of floating-point arithmetic operators outside of constant expressions

double x = 1;
x / 10; // 0.09999999999999999167332731531132594682276248931884765625
// or 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625

- results of standard library mathematical functions

std::sqrt(2); // 1.41421356237309492343001693370752036571502685546875
// or 1.4142135623730951454746218587388284504413604736328125

- floating-point to floating-point implicit conversion and casts

double d = 1 + std::numeric_limits<double>::epsilon();
float f = d; // 1.00000000000000000000000
// or 1.00000011920928955078125

- string conversions such as std::strtod or std::printf

std::stof("0.1"); // 0.0999999940395355224609375
// or 0.100000001490116119384765625

- the library rounding functions std::nearbyint, std::rint, std::lrint

std::lrint(2.1); // 2 or 3

The current rounding mode does NOT affect the following:

- floating-point to integer implicit conversion and casts (always towards zero),

- results of floating-point arithmetic operators in expressions executed at compile time (always to nearest),

- the library functions std::round, std::lround, std::llround, std::ceil, std::floor, std::trunc.

As with any floating-point environment functionality, rounding is only guaranteed if #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON is set.

Compilers that do not support the pragma may offer their own ways to support current rounding mode. For example Clang and GCC have the option -frounding-math intended to disable optimizations that would change the meaning of rounding-sensitive code.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cfenv>
#include <cmath>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
// #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
 
int main()
{
std::fesetround(FE_DOWNWARD);
std::cout << "rounding down: \n" << std::setprecision(50)
<< " pi = " << std::acos(-1.f) << '\n'
<< "stof(\"1.1\") = " << std::stof("1.1") << '\n'
<< " rint(2.1) = " << std::rint(2.1) << "\n\n";
std::fesetround(FE_UPWARD);
std::cout << "rounding up: \n"
<< " pi = " << std::acos(-1.f) << '\n'
<< "stof(\"1.1\") = " << std::stof("1.1") << '\n'
<< " rint(2.1) = " << std::rint(2.1) << '\n';
}

Output:

rounding down:
pi = 3.141592502593994140625
stof("1.1") = 1.099999904632568359375
rint(2.1) = 2
 
rounding up:
pi = 3.1415927410125732421875
stof("1.1") = 1.10000002384185791015625
rint(2.1) = 3
