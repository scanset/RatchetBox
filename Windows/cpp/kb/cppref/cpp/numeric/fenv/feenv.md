int fegetenv( std::fenv_t* envp )

(1)
(since C++11)

int fesetenv( const std::fenv_t* envp );

(2)
(since C++11)

Manages the status of the floating-point environment.

1) Attempts to store the status of the floating-point environment in the object pointed to by envp.

2) Attempts to establish the floating-point environment from the object pointed to by envp. The value of that object must be previously obtained by a call to std::feholdexcept or std::fegetenv or be a floating-point macro constant. If any of the floating-point status flags are set in envp, they become set in the environment (and are then testable with std::fetestexcept), but the corresponding floating-point exceptions are not raised (execution continues uninterrupted)

### Parameters

envp

-

pointer to the object of type std::fenv_t which holds the status of the floating-point environment

### Return value

​0​ on success, non-zero otherwise.
