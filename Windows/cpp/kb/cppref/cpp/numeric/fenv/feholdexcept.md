int feholdexcept( std::fenv_t* envp )

(since C++11)

First, saves the current floating-point environment to the object pointed to by envp (similar to std::fegetenv), then clears all floating-point status flags, and then installs the non-stop mode: future floating-point exceptions will not interrupt execution (will not trap), until the floating-point environment is restored by std::feupdateenv or std::fesetenv.

This function may be used in the beginning of a subroutine that must hide the floating-point exceptions it may raise from the caller. If only some exceptions must be suppressed, while others must be reported, the non-stop mode is usually ended with a call to std::feupdateenv after clearing the unwanted exceptions.

### Parameters

envp

-

pointer to the object of type std::fenv_t where the floating-point environment will be stored

### Return value

​0​ on success, non-zero otherwise.
