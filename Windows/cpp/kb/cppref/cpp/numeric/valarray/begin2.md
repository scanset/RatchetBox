/* see below */ begin( const valarray<T>& v );

The overload of std::begin for valarray returns an iterator of unspecified type referring to the first element in the numeric array. 

1) The return type must

- meet the requirements of mutable LegacyRandomAccessIterator,

- model contiguous_iterator,

(since C++20)

- have a member type value_type, which is T, and

- have a member type reference, which is T&.

2) The return type must

- meet the requirements of constant LegacyRandomAccessIterator,

- model contiguous_iterator,

(since C++20)

- have a member type value_type, which is T, and

- have a member type reference, which is const T&.

The iterator returned from this function is invalidated when the member function resize() is called on v or when the lifetime of v ends, whichever comes first.

### Parameters

v

-

a numeric array

### Return value

Iterator to the first value in the numeric array.

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions. 

### Notes

Unlike other functions that take std::valarray arguments, begin() cannot accept the replacement types (such as the types produced by expression templates) that may be returned from expressions involving valarrays: std::begin(v1 + v2) is not portable, std::begin(std::valarray<T>(v1 + v2)) has to be used instead.

The intent of this function is to allow range for loops to work with valarrays, not to provide container semantics.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <valarray>
 
void show(const std::valarray<int>& v)
{
std::for_each(std::begin(v), std::end(v), [](int c)
{
std::cout << c << ' ';
});
std::cout << '\n';
};
 
int main()
{
const std::valarray<int> x{47, 70, 37, 52, 90, 23, 17, 33, 22, 16, 21, 4};
const std::valarray<int> y{25, 31, 71, 56, 21, 21, 15, 34, 21, 27, 12, 6};
 
show(x); 
show(y); 
 
const std::valarray<int> z{x + y};
 
for (char c : z)
std::cout << c;
}

Output:

47 70 37 52 90 23 17 33 22 16 21 4 
25 31 71 56 21 21 15 34 21 27 12 6
