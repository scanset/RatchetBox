T sum() const;

Computes the sum of the elements. 

The function can be used only if operator+= is defined for type T. If the std::valarray is empty, the behavior is undefined. The order in which the elements are processed by this function is unspecified.

### Parameters

### Return value

The sum of the elements.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <valarray>
 
int main()
{
std::valarray<int> a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
std::cout << a.sum() << '\n';
}

Output:
