template< class T > 

/* see below */ end( const valarray<T>& v );

(2)
(since C++11)

The overload of std::end for valarray returns an iterator of unspecified type referring to the one past the last element in the numeric array. 

1) The return type must

- meet the requirements of mutable LegacyRandomAccessIterator,

- model contiguous_iterator,

(since C++20)

- have a member type value_type, which is T, and

- have a member type reference, which is T&.

2) The return type must

- meet the requirements of constant LegacyRandomAccessIterator,

- model contiguous_iterator,

(since C++20)

- have a member type value_type, which is T, and

- have a member type reference, which is const T&.

The iterator returned from this function is invalidated when the member function resize() is called on v or when the lifetime of v ends, whichever comes first.

### Parameters

v

-

a numeric array

### Return value

Iterator to one past the last value in the numeric array.

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions. 

### Notes

Unlike other functions that take std::valarray arguments, end() cannot accept the replacement types (such as the types produced by expression templates) that may be returned from expressions involving valarrays: std::end(v1 + v2) is not portable, std::end(std::valarray<T>(v1 + v2)) has to be used instead.

The intent of this function is to allow range for loops to work with valarrays, not to provide container semantics.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <valarray>
 
int main()
{
const std::valarray<char> va
{
'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 
',', ' ', 
'C', '+', '+', '!', '\n'
};
 
std::for_each(std::begin(va), std::end(va),
[](char c){ std::cout << c; });
}

Output:

Hello, C++!
