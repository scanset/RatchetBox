(3)

complex& operator=( F x );

(until C++20)

constexpr complex& operator=( F x );

(since C++20) 
(until C++23)

Assigns new values to the contents.

1,2) Assigns cx.real() and cx.imag() to the real and the imaginary parts of the complex number respectively. The copy assignment operator (1) is trivial when T is a floating-point type.(since C++23)

3) Assigns x to the real part of the complex number. Imaginary part is set to zero.

### Parameters

x

-

value to assign

cx

-

complex value to assign

### Return value

*this

### Notes

The copy assignment operator is required to be trivial since C++23, but implementations generally make it trivial in all modes.
