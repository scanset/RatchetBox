template< class T > 

complex<T> sinh( const complex<T>& z );

(since C++11)

Computes complex hyperbolic sine of a complex value z. 

### Parameters

z

-

complex value

### Return value

If no errors occur, complex hyperbolic sine of z is returned.

### Error handling and special values

Errors are reported consistent with math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic,

- std::sinh(std::conj(z)) == std::conj(std::sinh(z))

- std::sinh(z) == -std::sinh(-z)

- If z is (+0,+0), the result is (+0,+0)

- If z is (+0,+∞), the result is (±0,NaN) (the sign of the real part is unspecified) and FE_INVALID is raised

- If z is (+0,NaN), the result is (±0,NaN)

- If z is (x,+∞) (for any positive finite x), the result is (NaN,NaN) and FE_INVALID is raised

- If z is (x,NaN) (for any positive finite x), the result is (NaN,NaN) and FE_INVALID may be raised

- If z is (+∞,+0), the result is (+∞,+0)

- If z is (+∞,y) (for any positive finite y), the result is +∞cis(y)

- If z is (+∞,+∞), the result is (±∞,NaN) (the sign of the real part is unspecified) and FE_INVALID is raised

- If z is (+∞,NaN), the result is (±∞,NaN) (the sign of the real part is unspecified)

- If z is (NaN,+0), the result is (NaN,+0)

- If z is (NaN,y) (for any finite nonzero y), the result is (NaN,NaN) and FE_INVALID may be raised

- If z is (NaN,NaN), the result is (NaN,NaN)

where cis(y) is cos(y) + i sin(y).

### Notes

Mathematical definition of hyperbolic sine is sinh z = ez
-e-z

.
Hyperbolic sine is an entire function in the complex plane and has no branch cuts. It is periodic with respect to the imaginary component, with period 2πi.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::cout << std::fixed;
std::complex<double> z(1.0, 0.0); // behaves like real sinh along the real line
std::cout << "sinh" << z << " = " << std::sinh(z)
<< " (sinh(1) = " << std::sinh(1) << ")\n";
 
std::complex<double> z2(0.0, 1.0); // behaves like sine along the imaginary line
std::cout << "sinh" << z2 << " = " << std::sinh(z2)
<< " ( sin(1) = " << std::sin(1) << ")\n";
}

Output:

sinh(1.000000,0.000000) = (1.175201,0.000000) (sinh(1) = 1.175201)
sinh(0.000000,1.000000) = (0.000000,0.841471) ( sin(1) = 0.841471)
