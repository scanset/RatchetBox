template< class T >

(1)

Additional overloads (since C++11)

Defined in header <complex>

(A)

float       arg( float f );

double      arg( double f );

long double arg( long double f );

(until C++23)

template< class FloatingPoint > 

FloatingPoint

arg( FloatingPoint f );

(since C++23)

template< class Integer > 

double      arg( Integer i );

(B)

1) Calculates the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number z.

A,B) Additional overloads are provided for all integer and floating-point types, which are treated as complex numbers with zero imaginary component.

(since C++11)

### Parameters

z

-

complex value

f

-

floating-point value

i

-

integer value

### Return value

1) std::atan2(std::imag(z), std::real(z)). If no errors occur, this is the phase angle of z in the interval [−π; π].

A) Zero if f is positive or +0, π if f is negative or -0, NaN otherwise.

B) Zero if i is non-negative, π if it is negative.

### Notes

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A,B). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num:

- If num has a standard(until C++23) floating-point type T, then std::arg(num) has the same effect as std::arg(std::complex<T>(num)).

- Otherwise, if num has an integer type, then std::arg(num) has the same effect as std::arg(std::complex<double>(num)).

### Example

Run this code

#include <complex>
#include <iostream>
 
int main() 
{
std::complex<double> z1(1, 0);
std::complex<double> z2(0, 0);
std::complex<double> z3(0, 1);
std::complex<double> z4(-1, 0);
std::complex<double> z5(-1, -0.0);
double f = 1.;
int i = -1;
 
std::cout << "phase angle of " << z1 << " is " << std::arg(z1) << '\n'
<< "phase angle of " << z2 << " is " << std::arg(z2) << '\n'
<< "phase angle of " << z3 << " is " << std::arg(z3) << '\n'
<< "phase angle of " << z4 << " is " << std::arg(z4) << '\n'
<< "phase angle of " << z5 << " is " << std::arg(z5) << " "
"(the other side of the cut)\n"
<< "phase angle of " << f << " is " << std::arg(f) << '\n'
<< "phase angle of " << i << " is " << std::arg(i) << '\n';
 
}

Output:

phase angle of (1,0) is 0
phase angle of (0,0) is 0
phase angle of (0,1) is 1.5708
phase angle of (-1,0) is 3.14159
phase angle of (-1,-0) is -3.14159 (the other side of the cut)
phase angle of 1 is 0
phase angle of -1 is 3.14159
