Defined in header <complex>

template< class T >

struct tuple_size<std::complex<T>>

: std::integral_constant<std::size_t, 2> {};

(since C++26)

The partial specialization of std::tuple_size for std::complex provides a compile-time way to obtain the number of components of a complex, which is always 2, using tuple-like syntax. It is provided for structured binding support.

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

the constant value 2 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator std::size_t

converts the object to std::size_t, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)

### Member types

### Example

Run this code

#include <complex>
 
static_assert(std::tuple_size_v<std::complex<float>> == 2);
 
static_assert([]
{
using namespace std::literals;
auto [re, im] = -1.5 + 2.5i;
return re == -1.5 && im == 2.5;
}());
 
static_assert([]
{
using namespace std::literals;
auto z = std::complex<double>{};
auto& [re, im] = z;
re = 1.0;
im = 2.0;
return z == 1.0 + 2.0i;
}());
 
int main() {}
