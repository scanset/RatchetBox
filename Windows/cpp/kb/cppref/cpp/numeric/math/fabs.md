Additional overloads (since C++11)

Defined in header <cmath>

double      fabs ( Integer num );

(A)
(since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++23)

1-4) Computes the absolute value of the floating-point value num. The library provides overloads of std::abs and std::fabs for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter num.(since C++23)

A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double.

(since C++11)

For integral arguments, the integral overloads of std::abs are likely better matches. If std::abs is called with an unsigned integral argument that cannot be converted to int by integral promotion, the program is ill-formed.

### Parameters

num

-

floating-point or integer value

### Return value

If successful, returns the absolute value of arg (|arg|). The value returned is exact and does not depend on any rounding modes.

### Error handling

This function is not subject to any of the error conditions specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- If the argument is ±0, +0 is returned.

- If the argument is ±∞, +∞ is returned.

- If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, std::fabs(num) has the same effect as std::fabs(static_cast<double>(num)).

### Example

Run this code

#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::cout << "abs(+3.0) = " << std::abs(+3.0) << '\n'
<< "abs(-3.0) = " << std::abs(-3.0) << '\n';
 
// special values
std::cout << "abs(-0.0) = " << std::abs(-0.0) << '\n'
<< "abs(-Inf) = " << std::abs(-INFINITY) << '\n'
<< "abs(-NaN) = " << std::abs(-NAN) << '\n';
}

Possible output:

abs(+3.0) = 3
abs(-3.0) = 3
abs(-0.0) = 0
abs(-Inf) = inf
abs(-NaN) = nan
