Additional overloads (since C++11)

Defined in header <cmath>

double      log2 ( Integer num );

(A)
(constexpr since C++26)

1-3) Computes the binary (base-2) logarithm of num. The library provides overloads of std::log2 for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter.(since C++23)

S) The SIMD overload performs an element-wise std::log2 on v_num.

(See math-floating-point and deduced-simd-t for their definitions.)

(since C++26)

A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double.

(since C++11)

### Parameters

num

-

floating-point or integer value

### Return value

If no errors occur, the base-2 logarithm of num (log2(num) or lb(num)) is returned.

If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned (NaN where supported).

If a pole error occurs, -HUGE_VAL, -HUGE_VALF, or -HUGE_VALL is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

Domain error occurs if num is less than zero.

Pole error may occur if num is zero.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- If the argument is ±0, -∞ is returned and FE_DIVBYZERO is raised.

- If the argument is 1, +0 is returned.

- If the argument is negative, NaN is returned and FE_INVALID is raised.

- If the argument is +∞, +∞ is returned.

- If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

For integer num, the binary logarithm can be interpreted as the zero-based index of the most significant 1 bit in the input.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, std::log2(num) has the same effect as std::log2(static_cast<double>(num)).

### Example

Run this code

#include <cerrno>
#include <cfenv>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
// #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
 
int main()
{
std::cout << "log2(65536) = " << std::log2(65536) << '\n'
<< "log2(0.125) = " << std::log2(0.125) << '\n'
<< "log2(0x020f) = " << std::log2(0x020f)
<< " (highest set bit is in position 9)\n"
<< "base-5 logarithm of 125 = "
<< std::log2(125) / std::log2(5) << '\n';
 
// special values
std::cout << "log2(1) = " << std::log2(1) << '\n'
<< "log2(+Inf) = " << std::log2(INFINITY) << '\n';
 
// error handling
errno = 0;
std::feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
 
std::cout << "log2(0) = " << std::log2(0) << '\n';
 
if (errno == ERANGE)
std::cout << " errno == ERANGE: " << std::strerror(errno) << '\n';
if (std::fetestexcept(FE_DIVBYZERO))
std::cout << " FE_DIVBYZERO raised\n";
}

Possible output:

log2(65536) = 16
log2(0.125) = -3
log2(0x020f) = 9.04166 (highest set bit is in position 9)
base-5 logarithm of 125 = 3
log2(1) = 0
log2(+Inf) = inf
log2(0) = -inf
errno == ERANGE: Numerical result out of range
FE_DIVBYZERO raised
