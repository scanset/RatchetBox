#define math_errhandling  /*implementation defined*/

(since C++11)

The macro constant math_errhandling expands to an expression of type int that is either equal to MATH_ERRNO, or equal to MATH_ERREXCEPT, or equal to their bitwise OR (MATH_ERRNO | MATH_ERREXCEPT).

The value of math_errhandling indicates the type of error handling that is performed by the floating-point operators and functions:

Constant

Explanation

MATH_ERREXCEPT

Indicates that floating-point exceptions are used: at least FE_DIVBYZERO, FE_INVALID, and FE_OVERFLOW are defined in <cfenv>.

MATH_ERRNO

Indicates that floating-point operations use the variable errno to report errors.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559), math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT is required to be non-zero.

The following floating-point error conditions are recognized:

Condition
Explanation
errno
Floating-point exception
Example

Domain error

The argument is outside the range in which the operation is mathematically defined (the description of each function lists the required domain errors)

EDOM

FE_INVALID

std::acos(2)

Pole error

The mathematical result of the function is exactly infinite or undefined

ERANGE

FE_DIVBYZERO

std::log(0.0), 1.0 / 0.0

Range error due to overflow

The mathematical result is finite, but becomes infinite after rounding, or becomes the largest representable finite value after rounding down

ERANGE

FE_OVERFLOW

std::pow(DBL_MAX, 2)

Range error due to underflow

The result is non-zero, but becomes zero after rounding, or becomes subnormal with a loss of precision

ERANGE or unchanged (implementation-defined)

FE_UNDERFLOW or nothing (implementation-defined)

DBL_TRUE_MIN / 2

Inexact result

The result has to be rounded to fit in the destination type

Unchanged

FE_INEXACT or nothing (unspecified)

std::sqrt(2), 1.0 / 10.0

### Notes

Whether FE_INEXACT is raised by the mathematical library functions is unspecified in general, but may be explicitly specified in the description of the function (e.g. std::rint vs std::nearbyint).

Before C++11, floating-point exceptions were not specified, EDOM was required for any domain error, ERANGE was required for overflows and implementation-defined for underflows.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cerrno>
#include <cfenv>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
// #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
 
int main()
{
std::cout << "MATH_ERRNO is "
<< (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO ? "set" : "not set") << '\n'
<< "MATH_ERREXCEPT is "
<< (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT ? "set" : "not set") << '\n';
std::feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
errno = 0;
std::cout << "log(0) = " << std::log(0) << '\n';
if (errno == ERANGE)
std::cout << "errno = ERANGE (" << std::strerror(errno) << ")\n";
if (std::fetestexcept(FE_DIVBYZERO))
std::cout << "FE_DIVBYZERO (pole error) reported\n";
}

Possible output:

MATH_ERRNO is set
MATH_ERREXCEPT is set
log(0) = -inf
errno = ERANGE (Numerical result out of range)
FE_DIVBYZERO (pole error) reported
