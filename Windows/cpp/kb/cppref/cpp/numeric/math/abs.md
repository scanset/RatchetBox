(7)
(since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++23)

Computes the absolute value of the integer number num. The behavior is undefined if the result cannot be represented by the return type.

If std::abs is called with an unsigned integral argument that cannot be converted to int by integral promotion, the program is ill-formed.

Overload (6) of std::abs for std::intmax_t is provided in <cinttypes> if and only if std::intmax_t is an extended integer type.

(since C++11)

### Parameters

num

-

integer value

### Return value

The absolute value of num (i.e. |num|), if it is representable.

### Notes

In 2's complement systems, the absolute value of the most-negative value is out of range, e.g. for 32-bit 2's complement type int, INT_MIN is -2147483648, but the would-be result 2147483648 is greater than INT_MAX, which is 2147483647.

### Example

Run this code

#include <climits>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::cout << std::showpos
<< "abs(+3) = " << std::abs(3) << '\n'
<< "abs(-3) = " << std::abs(-3) << '\n';
 
// std::cout << std::abs(INT_MIN); // undefined behavior on 2's complement systems
}

Output:

abs(+3) = +3
abs(-3) = +3
