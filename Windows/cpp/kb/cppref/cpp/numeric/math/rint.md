1-3) Rounds the floating-point argument num to an integer value (in floating-point format), using the current rounding mode. The library provides overloads of std::rint for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter num.(since C++23)

4-9) Rounds the floating-point argument num to an integer value, using the current rounding mode. The library provides overloads of std::lrint and std::llrint for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter num.(since C++23)

A-C) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double.

### Parameters

num

-

floating-point or integer value

### Return value

If no errors occur, the nearest integer value to num, according to the current rounding mode, is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

If the result of std::lrint or std::llrint is outside the range representable by the return type, a domain error or a range error may occur.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

For the std::rint function:

- If num is ±∞, it is returned, unmodified.

- If num is ±0, it is returned, unmodified.

- If num is NaN, NaN is returned.

For std::lrint and std::llrint functions:

- If num is ±∞, FE_INVALID is raised and an implementation-defined value is returned.

- If the result of the rounding is outside the range of the return type, FE_INVALID is raised and an implementation-defined value is returned.

- If num is NaN, FE_INVALID is raised and an implementation-defined value is returned.

### Notes

POSIX specifies that all cases where std::lrint or std::llrint raise FE_INEXACT are domain errors.

As specified in math_errhandling, FE_INEXACT may be (but isn't required to be on non-IEEE floating-point platforms) raised by std::rint when rounding a non-integer finite value.

The only difference between std::rint and std::nearbyint is that std::nearbyint never raises FE_INEXACT.

The largest representable floating-point values are exact integers in all standard floating-point formats, so std::rint never overflows on its own; however the result may overflow any integer type (including std::intmax_t), when stored in an integer variable.

If the current rounding mode is:

- FE_DOWNWARD, then std::rint is equivalent to std::floor.

- FE_UPWARD, then std::rint is equivalent to std::ceil.

- FE_TOWARDZERO, then std::rint is equivalent to std::trunc.

- FE_TONEAREST, then std::rint differs from std::round in that halfway cases are rounded to even rather than away from zero.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A-C). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type:

- std::rint(num) has the same effect as std::rint(static_cast<double>(num)).

- std::lrint(num) has the same effect as std::lrint(static_cast<double>(num)).

- std::llrint(num) has the same effect as std::llrint(static_cast<double>(num)).

Possible output:

Rounding to nearest (halfway cases to even):
rint(+2.3) = 2
rint(+2.5) = 2
rint(+3.5) = 4
rint(-2.3) = -2
rint(-2.5) = -2
rint(-3.5) = -4
Rounding down:
rint(+2.3) = 2
rint(+2.5) = 2
rint(+3.5) = 4
rint(-2.3) = -2
rint(-2.5) = -2
rint(-3.5) = -4
Rounding down with lrint:
lrint(+2.3) = 2
lrint(+2.5) = 2
lrint(+3.5) = 3
lrint(-2.3) = -3
lrint(-2.5) = -3
lrint(-3.5) = -4

lrint(-0.0) = 0
lrint(-Inf) = 0x8000000000000000
std::rint(0.1) = 0
std::lrint(LONG_MIN-2048.0) = 0x8000000000000000
