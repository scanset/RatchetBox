Defined in header <numeric>

template< class T >

constexpr T sub_sat( T x, T y ) noexcept;

(since C++26)

Computes the saturating subtraction x - y. This operation (unlike built-in arithmetic operations on integers) behaves as-if it is a mathematical operation with an infinite range. Let q denote the result of such operation.
Returns:

- q, if q is representable as a value of type T. Otherwise,

- the largest or smallest value of type T, whichever is closer to the q.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if T is an integer type, that is: signed char, short, int, long, long long, an extended signed integer type, or an unsigned version of such types. In particular, T must not be (possibly cv-qualified) bool, char, wchar_t, char8_t, char16_t, and char32_t, as these types are not intended for arithmetic.

### Parameters

x, y

-

integer values

### Return value

Saturated x - y.

### Notes

Unlike the built-in arithmetic operators on integers, the integral promotion does not apply to the x and y arguments.

If two arguments of different type are passed, the call fails to compile, i.e. the behavior relative to template argument deduction is the same as for std::min or std::max.

Most modern hardware architectures have efficient support for saturation arithmetic on SIMD vectors, including SSE2 for x86 and NEON for ARM.

Run this code

#include <climits>
#include <numeric>
 
static_assert
(""
&& (std::sub_sat<int>(INT_MIN + 4, 3) == INT_MIN + 1) // not saturated
&& (std::sub_sat<int>(INT_MIN + 4, 5) == INT_MIN) // saturated
&& (std::sub_sat<int>(INT_MAX - 4, -3) == INT_MAX - 1) // not saturated
&& (std::sub_sat<int>(INT_MAX - 4, -5) == INT_MAX) // saturated
&& (std::sub_sat<unsigned>(4, 3) == 1) // not saturated
&& (std::sub_sat<unsigned>(4, 5) == 0) // saturated
);
