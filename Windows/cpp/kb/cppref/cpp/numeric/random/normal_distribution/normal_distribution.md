normal_distribution() : normal_distribution(0.0) {}

(1)
(since C++11)

explicit normal_distribution( RealType mean, RealType stddev = 1.0 );

(2)
(since C++11)

explicit normal_distribution( const param_type& params );

(3)
(since C++11)

Constructs a new distribution object.

2) Uses mean and stddev as the distribution parameters.

3) Uses params as the distribution parameters.

The behavior is undefined if stddev is not greater than zero.

### Parameters

mean

-

the μ distribution parameter (mean)

stddev

-

the σ distribution parameter (standard deviation)

params

-

the distribution parameter set
