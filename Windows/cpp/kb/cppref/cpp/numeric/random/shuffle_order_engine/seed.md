void seed();

(1)
(since C++11)

void seed( result_type value );

(2)
(since C++11)

template< class SeedSeq > 

void seed( SeedSeq& seq );

(3)
(since C++11)

Reinitializes the internal state of the underlying engine using a new seed value.

1) Seeds the underlying engine with the default seed value. Effectively calls e.seed(), where e is the underlying engine.

2) Seeds the underlying engine with the seed value value. Effectively calls e.seed(value), where e is the underlying engine.

3) Seeds the underlying engine with the seed sequence seq. Effectively calls e.seed(seq), where e is the underlying engine.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if SeedSeq satisfies the requirements of SeedSequence.

### Parameters

value

-

seed value to use in the initialization of the internal state of the underlying engine

seq

-

seed sequence to use in the initialization of the internal state of the underlying engine

### Exceptions

3) If SeedSeq is not std::seed_seq, throws the exceptions thrown by the seq.generate call.
