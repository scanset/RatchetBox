friend bool operator!=( const shuffle_order_engine& lhs,

                        const shuffle_order_engine& rhs );

(2)
(since C++11) 
(until C++20)

Compares two pseudo-random number engine adaptors. Two engine adaptors are equal, if their underlying engines are equal and their internal state (if any) is equal, that is, if they would generate equivalent values for any number of calls of operator().

These functions are not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::shuffle_order_engine<Engine, k> is an associated class of the arguments.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

(since C++20)
