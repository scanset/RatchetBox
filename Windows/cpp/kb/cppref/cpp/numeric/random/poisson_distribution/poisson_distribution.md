poisson_distribution() : poisson_distribution(1.0) {}

(1)
(since C++11)

explicit poisson_distribution( double mean );

(2)
(since C++11)

explicit poisson_distribution( const param_type& params );

(3)
(since C++11)

1) Uses 1.0 as the distribution parameter.

2) Uses mean as the distribution parameter.

3) Uses params as the distribution parameter.

### Parameters
