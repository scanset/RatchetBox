uniform_real_distribution() : uniform_real_distribution(0.0) { }

(1)
(since C++11)

explicit uniform_real_distribution( RealType a, RealType b = 1.0 );

(2)
(since C++11)

explicit uniform_real_distribution( const param_type& params );

(3)
(since C++11)

Constructs a new distribution object.

2) Uses a and b as the distribution parameters.

3) Uses params as the distribution parameters.

### Parameters

a

-

the a distribution parameter (minimum value)

b

-

the b distribution parameter (maximum value)

params

-

the distribution parameter set

### Notes

Requires that a ≤ b and b - a ≤ std::numeric_limits<RealType>::max().

If a == b, subsequent calls to the operator() overload that does not accept a param_type object will cause undefined behavior.

To create a distribution over the closed interval [a,b], std::nextafter(b, std::numeric_limits<RealType>::max()) may be used as the second parameter.
