1) Writes the textual representation of the current state of e to os with fmtflags set to std::ios_base::dec | std::ios_base::left and the fill character set to the space character.

After writing, os's original fmtflags and fill character are restored.

2) Reads a textual representation of engine state from is (denoted as text) with fmtflags set to std::ios_base::dec, and sets the state of e to that state.

After reading, is's original fmtflags is restored.

- If text was not previously written using an output stream pr, the behavior is undefined.

- Otherwise, if any of the following values is false, the behavior is undefined:

- is.getloc() == pr.getloc()

- std::is_same<decltype(is)::char_type,
             decltype(pr)::char_type>::value

- std::is_same<decltype(is)::traits_type,
             decltype(pr)::traits_type>::value

- Otherwise, if text is not a valid textual representation of any state of decltype(e), the state of e is unchanged and is.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit) is called.

- Otherwise, given another engine eng of the same type as e. If text was previously written by pr << eng and there is no intervening invocations of e or of eng between pr << eng and is >> e, e == eng is true.

These function templates are not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when decltype(e) is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

os

-

output stream to insert the data to

is

-

input stream to extract the data from

e

-

pseudo-random number engine

### Return value

1) os

2) is

### Complexity

1,2) Constant.

### Exceptions

2) May throw std::ios_base::failure when setting std::ios_base::failbit.
