void seed( result_type value = default_seed );

(1)
(since C++11)

template< class SeedSeq > 

void seed( SeedSeq& seq );

(2)
(since C++11)

Sets the state of the random-number engine.

1) Right after the state is set, *this == std::mersenne_twister_engine(value) is true.

2) Right after the state is set, *this == std::mersenne_twister_engine(seq) is true.

### Parameters

value

-

seed value to use to set the state

seq

-

seed sequence to use to set the state

### Exceptions

2) If SeedSeq is not std::seed_seq, throws the exceptions thrown by the seq.generate call.

### Complexity

1) Same as std::mersenne_twister_engine(value).

2) Same as std::mersenne_twister_engine(seq).

(public member function)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <random>
 
int main()
{
std::mt19937 gen;
 
// Seed the engine with an unsigned int
gen.seed(1);
std::cout << "after seed by 1: " << gen() << '\n';
 
// Seed the engine with two unsigned ints
std::seed_seq sseq{1, 2};
gen.seed(sseq);
std::cout << "after seed by {1,2}: " << gen() << '\n';
}

Possible output:

after seed by 1: 1791095845
after seed by {1,2}: 3127717181
