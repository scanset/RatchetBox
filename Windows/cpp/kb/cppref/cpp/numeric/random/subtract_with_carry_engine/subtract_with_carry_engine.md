Constructs the pseudo-random number engine.

1) The default constructor.

- If the default-constructed engine is of type std::ranlux24_base, the 10000th consecutive invocation of it produces the value 7937952.

- If the default-constructed engine is of type std::ranlux48_base, the 10000th consecutive invocation of it produces the value 61839128582725.

2) Constructs the engine with a seed value value. The sequence X of the engine's initial state is determined as follows:

- Constructs a std::linear_congruential_engine<std::uint_least32_t, 40014u, 0u, 2147483563u> object e with argument value == 0u ? default_seed : static_cast<std::uint_least32_t>(value % 2147483563u).

- Let n be std::size_t(w / 32) + 1.

- Sets the values of \(\scriptsize X_{-r} \)X-r, ..., \(\scriptsize X_{-1} \)X-1, in that order. Each value \(\scriptsize X_i \)Xi is set as specified below:

- Successively calls e for n times, the return values are denoted as \(\scriptsize z_0 \)z0 ... \(\scriptsize z_{n-1} \)zn-1.

- Sets \(\scriptsize X_i \)Xi to \(\scriptsize (\sum^{n-1}_{j=0} z_j \cdot 2^{32j}) \mod m \)(∑n-1
j=0 zj·232j
) mod m.

If \(\scriptsize X_{-1} \)X-1 is ​0​, sets the carry value c of the engine's initial state to 1. Otherwise, sets c to ​0​.

3) Constructs the engine with a seed sequence seq. Given std::size_t(w / 32) + 1 as k, the sequence X of the engine's initial state is determined as follows:

- Creates an invented array object a of length r * k.

- Calls seq.generate(a + 0, a + r * k).

- For each integer i in [-r, -1], sets \(\scriptsize X_{i} \)Xi to \(\scriptsize (\sum^{k-1}_{j=0} a_{k(i+r)+j} \cdot 2^{32j}) \mod m \)(∑k-1
j=0 ak(i+r)+j·232j
) mod m.

If \(\scriptsize X_{-1} \)X-1 is ​0​, sets the carry value c of the engine's initial state to 1. Otherwise, sets c to ​0​.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if SeedSeq meets the requirements of SeedSequence.

4) The copy constructor. Upon construction, *this == other is true.

### Parameters

value

-

seed value to use in the initialization of the internal state

seq

-

seed sequence to use in the initialization of the internal state

### Complexity

1,2) (std::size_t(w / 32) + 1) * r invocations of e.

3) Same as the complexity of the seq.generate call.

4) \(\scriptsize O(r) \)O(r).

### Exceptions

3) If SeedSeq is not std::seed_seq, throws the exceptions thrown by the seq.generate call.

### Example

This section is incomplete
Reason: demos for overloads (2-4) required

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <random>
 
int main()
{
std::ranlux24_base gen24; // overload (1)
std::ranlux48_base gen48; // overload (1)
gen24.discard(10000 - 1);
gen48.discard(10000 - 1);
assert(gen24() == 7'937'952);
assert(gen48() == 61'839'128'582'725);
}
