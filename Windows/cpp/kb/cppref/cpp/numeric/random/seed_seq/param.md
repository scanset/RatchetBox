template< class OutputIt >

void param( OutputIt dest ) const;

(since C++11)

Copies the stored seeds to the range beginning with dest. Equivalent to std::copy(v ﻿.begin(), v ﻿.end(), dest);.

If values of type result_type are not writable to dest, the program is ill-formed.

If OutputIt does not satisfy the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

dest

-

the beginning iterator of the output range

### Exceptions

Only throws the exceptions thrown by the operations on dest.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <random>
 
int main()
{
std::seed_seq s1 = {-1, 0, 1};
s1.param(std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, " "));
}

Output:

-1 0 1
