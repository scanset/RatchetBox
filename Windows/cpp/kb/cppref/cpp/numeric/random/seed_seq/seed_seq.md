seed_seq() noexcept;

(1)
(since C++11)

seed_seq( const seed_seq& ) = delete;

(2)
(since C++11)

template< class InputIt >

seed_seq( InputIt begin, InputIt end );

(3)
(since C++11)

template< class T >

seed_seq( std::initializer_list<T> il );

(4)
(since C++11)

1) The default constructor. After construction, v is empty.

2) The copy constructor is deleted: std::seed_seq is not copyable.

3) Constructs a std::seed_seq with the values in the range [begin, end). Equivalent to default-initializing v ﻿ followed by for (InputIt s = begin; s != end; ++s)
    v ﻿.push_back(modseed(*s));, where \(\scriptsize \mathrm{modseed}(x)=x \mod 2^{32} \)mod_seed(x)=x mod 232
.

If std::iterator_traits<InputIt>::value_type is not an integer type, the program is ill-formed.

If InputIt does not satisfy the requirements of LegacyInputIterator, the behavior is undefined.

4) Equivalent to seed_seq(il.begin(), il.end()). This constructor enables list-initialization from the list of seed values.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if T is an integer type.

### Parameters

begin, end

-

the pair of iterators denoting the initial seed sequence

il

-

the initial seed sequence

### Example

Run this code

#include <iterator>
#include <random>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
std::seed_seq s1; // default-constructible
std::seed_seq s2{1, 2, 3}; // can use list-initialization
std::seed_seq s3 = {-1, 0, 1}; // another form of list-initialization
int a[10] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
std::seed_seq s4(a, a + 10); // can use iterators
std::istringstream buf("1 2 3 4 5"); 
std::istream_iterator<int> beg(buf), end;
std::seed_seq s5(beg, end); // even stream input iterators
}
