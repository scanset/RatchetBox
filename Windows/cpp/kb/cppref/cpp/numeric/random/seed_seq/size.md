std::size_t size() const noexcept;

(since C++11)

Returns the size of the underlying seed sequence.

### Return value

v ﻿.size()

### Complexity

Constant time.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <random>
 
int main()
{
std::seed_seq s1 = {-1, 0, 1};
std::cout << s1.size() << '\n';
}

Output:

3
