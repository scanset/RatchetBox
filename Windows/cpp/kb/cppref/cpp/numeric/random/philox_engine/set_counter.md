void set_counter( const std::array<result_type, n>& c );

(since C++26)

Sets the counter of the random-number engine.

- For each integer k in [​0​, n), sets \(\scriptsize X_k \)Xk to \(\scriptsize c_{n-1-k} \mod 2^w \)cn-1-k mod 2w
.

- The value of j is set to n - 1.[1]

- ↑ As j is being set to n - 1, the next state transition always generates new random values.

### Parameters

c

-

counter sequence to use to set the counter

### Complexity

\(\scriptsize O(n) \)O(n).
