Constructs the pseudo-random number engine.

1) The default constructor.

- If the default-constructed engine is of type std::philox4x32, the 10000th consecutive invocation of it produces the value 1955073260.

- If the default-constructed engine is of type std::philox4x64, the 10000th consecutive invocation of it produces the value 3409172418970261260.

2) Constructs the engine with a seed value value. The engine's initial state is determined as follows:[1]

- All elements of the sequence X are set to zero.

- The first element of the sequence K is set to \(\scriptsize value \mod 2^w \)value mod 2w
, the remaining elements are set to zero.

- The value of j is set to n - 1.

3) Constructs the engine with a seed sequence seq. The engine's initial state is determined as follows:[1]

- All elements of the sequence X are set to zero.

- Given (w - 1) / 32 + 1 as p, the elements of the sequence K are set by the following steps:

- Creates an invented array object a of length n / 2 * p.

- Calls seq.generate(a + 0, a + n / 2 * p).

- For each integer k in [​0​, n / 2), sets \(\scriptsize K_k \)Kk to \(\scriptsize (\sum^{p-1}_{i=0} a_{k \cdot p+i} \cdot 2^{32i}) \mod 2^w \)(∑p-1
i=0 ak·p+i·232i
) mod 2w
.

- The value of j is set to n - 1.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if SeedSeq meets the requirements of SeedSequence.

4) The copy constructor. Upon construction, *this == other is true.

- ↑ 1.0 1.1 The buffer Y is intentionally not being set. As j is being set to n - 1, the next state transition always generates new random values and stores them in Y.

### Parameters

value

-

seed value to use in the initialization of the internal state

seq

-

seed sequence to use in the initialization of the internal state

### Complexity

1,2) Constant.

3) Same as the complexity of the seq.generate call.

4) Constant.

### Exceptions

3) If SeedSeq is not std::seed_seq, throws the exceptions thrown by the seq.generate call.
