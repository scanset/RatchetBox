Specifies that an object of the type can be destroyed by a given Allocator.

### Requirements

Given the following types, values and expressions:

Type

Definition

T

an object type

A

an allocator type

X

a container type satisfying all following conditions:

- X::value_type is the same as T.

- X::allocator_type is the same as std::allocator_traits<A>::rebind_alloc<T>.

Value

Definition

m

an lvalue of type A

p

a pointer of type T*

If the expression std::allocator_traits<A>::destroy(m, p) is well-formed, T is Erasable from X.

### Notes

All standard library containers require that their value types satisfy Erasable.

With the default allocator, this requirement is equivalent to the validity of p->~T(), which accepts class types with accessible destructors and all scalar types, but rejects array types, function types, reference types, and void.

(until C++20)

With the default allocator, this requirement is equivalent to the validity of std::destroy_at(p), which accepts class types with accessible destructors and all scalar types, as well as arrays thereof.

(since C++20)

Although it is required that customized destroy is used when destroying elements of std::basic_string until C++23, all implementations only used the default mechanism. The requirement is corrected by P1072R10 to match existing practice.
