The Lockable requirements extends the BasicLockable requirements to include attempted locking.

### Requirements

- BasicLockable

For type L to be Lockable, it must meet the above condition as well as the following:

Expression
Effects
Return value

m.try_lock()

Attempts to acquire the lock for the current execution agent (thread, process, task) without blocking. If an exception is thrown, no lock is obtained.

true if the lock was acquired, false otherwise

### Notes

The try_lock member functions obtains a non-shared lock on m on success.

### Standard library

The following standard library types satisfy Lockable requirements:

mutex

(C++11)

provides basic mutual exclusion facility 
(class)

recursive_mutex

(C++11)

provides mutual exclusion facility which can be locked recursively by the same thread 
(class)

recursive_timed_mutex

(C++11)

provides mutual exclusion facility which can be locked recursively
by the same thread and implements locking with a timeout 
(class)

shared_mutex

(C++17)

provides shared mutual exclusion facility 
(class)

shared_timed_mutex

(C++14)

provides shared mutual exclusion facility and implements locking with a timeout 
(class)

timed_mutex

(C++11)

provides mutual exclusion facility which implements locking with a timeout 
(class)
