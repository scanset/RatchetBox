The BasicLockable requirements describe the minimal characteristics of types that provide exclusive blocking semantics for execution agents (i.e. threads).

### Requirements

For type L to be BasicLockable, the following conditions have to be satisfied for an object m of type L:

Expression
Preconditions
Effects

m.lock()

Blocks until a lock can be acquired for the current execution agent (thread, process, task). If an exception is thrown, no lock is acquired.

m.unlock()

The current execution agent holds a non-shared lock on m.

Releases the non-shared lock held by the execution agent.
Throws no exceptions.

#### Non-shared locks

A lock on an object is said to be non-shared lock if it is acquired by a call to lock, try_lock, try_lock_for, or try_lock_until member function.

### Standard library

The following standard library types satisfy BasicLockable requirements:

mutex

(C++11)

provides basic mutual exclusion facility 
(class)

recursive_mutex

(C++11)

provides mutual exclusion facility which can be locked recursively by the same thread 
(class)

recursive_timed_mutex

(C++11)

provides mutual exclusion facility which can be locked recursively
by the same thread and implements locking with a timeout 
(class)

shared_mutex

(C++17)

provides shared mutual exclusion facility 
(class)

shared_timed_mutex

(C++14)

provides shared mutual exclusion facility and implements locking with a timeout 
(class)

timed_mutex

(C++11)

provides mutual exclusion facility which implements locking with a timeout 
(class)
