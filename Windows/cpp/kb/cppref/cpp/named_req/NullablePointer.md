Specifies that the type is a pointer-like object which can be compared to std::nullptr_t objects.

### Requirements

The type must meet all of the following requirements:

- EqualityComparable

- DefaultConstructible

- CopyConstructible

- CopyAssignable

- Swappable

- Destructible

In addition, a value-initialized object of the type must produce a null value of that type. This null value shall only be equivalent to itself. Default initialization of the type may have an indeterminate or erroneous(since C++26) value.

A value of the type must be contextually convertible to bool. The effect of this conversion returns false if the value is equivalent to its null value and true otherwise.

None of the operations that this type performs may throw exceptions.

The type must satisfy the following additional expressions, given two values p and q that are of the type, and that np is a value of std::nullptr_t type (possibly const-qualified):

Declaration

Effects

Type p(np);
Type p = np;

Afterwards, p is equivalent to nullptr

Expression

Effects

Type(np)

A temporary object that is equivalent to nullptr

p = np

Must return a Type&, and afterwards, p is equivalent to nullptr

p != q

Type and value meet the BooleanTestable requirements

(until C++20)

decltype(p != q) models boolean-testable

(since C++20)

The effect is !(p == q)

p == np
np == p

Type and value of both expressions the BooleanTestable requirements

(until C++20)

decltype(p == np) and decltype(np == p) each model boolean-testable

(since C++20)

The effect is (p == Type())

p != np
np != p

Type and value of both expressions the BooleanTestable requirements

(until C++20)

decltype(p != np) and decltype(np != p) each model boolean-testable

(since C++20)

The effect is !(p == np)

### Notes

Note that dereferencing (operator* or operator->) is not required for a NullablePointer type. A minimalistic type that satisfies these requirements is

class handle
{
int id = 0;
public:
handle() = default;
handle(std::nullptr_t) {}
explicit operator bool() const { return id != 0; }
friend bool operator==(handle l, handle r) { return l.id == r.id; }
friend bool operator!=(handle l, handle r) { return !(l == r); }
// or only a defaulted operator== (since C++20)
};

### Standard library

The following types satisfy NullablePointer:

- std::exception_ptr.

The following types must satisfy NullablePointer in order to communicate with standard library components:

- The member types X::pointer, X::const_pointer, X::void_pointer and X::const_void_pointer of every Allocator type X.

- The member type pointer of std::unique_ptr.

- The adapted pointer type of std::inout_ptr_t and std::out_ptr_t.

(since C++23)
