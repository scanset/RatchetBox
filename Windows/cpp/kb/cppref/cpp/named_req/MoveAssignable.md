Specifies that an instance of the type can be assigned from an rvalue argument. 

### Requirements

The type T satisfies MoveAssignable if

Given

- t, a modifiable lvalue expression of type T,

- rv, an rvalue expression of type T.

The following expressions must be valid and have their specified effects.

Expression
Return type
Return value
Post-conditions

t = rv

T&

t

If t and rv do not refer to the same object, the value of t is equivalent to the value of rv before the assignment.
The new value of rv is unspecified.

### Notes

The type does not have to implement move assignment operator in order to satisfy this type requirement: a copy assignment operator that takes its parameter by value or as a const Type&, will bind to rvalue argument.

If a MoveAssignable class implements a move assignment operator, it may also implement move semantics to take advantage of the fact that the value of rv after assignment is unspecified.
