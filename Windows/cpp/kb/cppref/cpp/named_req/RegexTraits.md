RegexTraits is a traits class that abstracts operations needed for a given character type when as template type parameters for std::basic_regex.

### Requirements

Given

- CharT, a character type

- X, a RegexTraits type for type CharT

- u, an object of type X

- v, an object of type const X

- p, a value of type const CharT*

- I1, I2, input iterators

- F1, F2, forward iterators

- c, a value of type const CharT

- s, an object of type X::string_type

- cs, an object of type const X::string_type

- b, a value of type bool

- I, a value of type int

- cl, an object of type X::char_class_type

- loc, an object of type X::locale_type

semantics

X::char_type
CharT
Used to refer to the character type.

X::string_type
std::basic_string<CharT>

X::locale_type

A CopyConstructible type that represents the locale used by the traits class.

X::char_class_type

A BitmaskType type that represents a particular character classification.

X::length(p)
std::size_t
Returns: the smallest i such that p[i] == 0. Complexity is linear in i.

v.translate(c)
X::char_type
Returns: a character such that for any character d considered to be equivalent to c, then v.translate(c) == v.translate(d).

v.translate_nocase(c)
X::char_type
Returns: a character such that for any character C considered to be equivalent to c without regard to case, then v.translate_nocase(c) == v.translate_nocase(C).

v.transform(F1, F2)
X::string_type
Returns: a sort key for the character sequence designated by the iterator range [F1, F2) such that if the character sequence [G1, G2) sorts before the character sequence [H1, H2), then v.transform(G1, G2) < v.transform(H1, H2).

v.transform_primary(F1, F2)
X::string_type
Returns: a sort key for the character sequence designated by the iterator range [F1, F2) such that if the character sequence [G1, G2) sorts before the character sequence [H1, H2) without regard to case, then v.transform_primary(G1, G2) < v.transform_primary(H1, H2).

v.lookup_collatename(F1, F2)
X::string_type
Returns:

- An empty string if the character sequence is not a valid collating element

- A sequence of characters that represents the collating element consisting of the character sequence designated by the iterator range [F1, F2) otherwise

v.lookup_classname(F1, F2, b)
X::char_class_type

- Converts the character sequence designated by the iterator range [F1, F2) into a value of a BitmaskType that can subsequently be passed to isctype

- Values returned from lookup_classname can be bitwise or'ed together; the resulting value represents membership in either of the corresponding character classes

- If b is true, the returned bitmask is suitable for matching characters without regard to their case.

- Returns ​0​ if the character sequence is not the name of a character class recognized by X.

- The value returned shall be independent of the case of the characters in the sequence.

v.isctype(c, cl)
bool
Returns: whether c is a member of one of the character classes designated by cl or not.

v.value(c, I)
int
Returns:

- The value represented by the digit c in base I if the character c is a valid digit in base I

- -1 otherwise

u.imbue(loc)
X::locale_type

- Imbues u with the locale loc

- Returns: The previous locale used by u if any

v.getloc()
X::locale_type
Returns: The previous locale used by v if any.

### Standard library

RegexTraits is satisfied by the following standard library classes:

template<> class regex_traits<char>;

template<> class regex_traits<wchar_t>;
