A LegacyBidirectionalIterator is a LegacyForwardIterator that can be moved in both directions (i.e. incremented and decremented). 

If a LegacyBidirectionalIterator it originates from a Container, then it's value_type is the same as the container's, so dereferencing (*it) obtains the container's value_type.

### Requirements

The type It satisfies LegacyBidirectionalIterator if

- The type It satisfies LegacyForwardIterator

And, given

- a and b, lvalues of type It

- reference, the type denoted by std::iterator_traits<It>::reference

The following expressions must be valid and have their specified effects:

Expression
Return
Equivalent expression
Notes

--a
It&

Preconditions:

- a is decrementable (there exists such b that a == ++b)

Postconditions:

- a is dereferenceable

- --(++a) == a

- If --a == --b then a == b

- a and --a designate the same iterator object

a--
convertible to const It&
It temp = a;

--a;

return temp;

*a--
reference

A mutable LegacyBidirectionalIterator is a LegacyBidirectionalIterator that additionally satisfies the LegacyOutputIterator requirements.

### Notes

The begin iterator is not decrementable and the behavior is undefined if --container.begin() is evaluated.

A bidirectional iterator does not have to be dereferenceable to be decrementable (in particular, the end iterator is not dereferenceable but is decrementable).

### Concept

For the definition of std::iterator_traits, the following exposition-only concept is defined.

template<class I>

concept __LegacyBidirectionalIterator =

    __LegacyForwardIterator<I> && requires(I i)

    {

        {  --i } -> std::same_as<I&>;

        {  i-- } -> std::convertible_to<const I&>;

        { *i-- } -> std::same_as<std::iter_reference_t<I>>;

};

where the exposition-only concept __LegacyForwardIterator is described in LegacyForwardIterator.

(since C++20)

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

LWG 299
(N3066)

C++98

the return type of *a-- was
required to be convertible to T

changed the return
type to reference[1]

LWG 383

C++98

b was required to be dereferenceable after --a

a is required to be dereferenceable instead

LWG 1212
(N3066)

C++98

the return type of *a-- did not match the return
type of *a++ required by LegacyForwardIterator

changed the return
type to reference

- ↑ This issue was initially resolved by N2758 (iterator concepts), which was dropped later from the C++ standard.
