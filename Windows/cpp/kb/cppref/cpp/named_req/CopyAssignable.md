Specifies that an instance of the type can be copy-assigned from an lvalue expression.

### Requirements

The type T satisfies CopyAssignable if

- The type T satisfies MoveAssignable, and

Given

- t, a modifiable lvalue expression of type T,

- v, an lvalue expression of type T or const T or an rvalue expression of type const T.

The following expressions must be valid and have their specified effects.
