The TrivialClock requirements describe the requirements satisfied by several clocks in the chrono library.

### Requirements

For a type TC:

- The type must meet Clock requirements.

- The types TC::rep, TC::duration, and TC::time_point satisfy the requirements of EqualityComparable, LessThanComparable, DefaultConstructible, CopyConstructible, CopyAssignable, Destructible(until C++17), Swappable, and NumericType.

- The function TC::now() does not throw exceptions.

- The type TC::time_point::clock meets the TrivialClock requirements, recursively.

### Standard library

The following types in the standard library satisfy TrivialClock requirements:

system_clock

(C++11)

wall clock time from the system-wide realtime clock 
(class)

steady_clock

(C++11)

monotonic clock that will never be adjusted 
(class)

high_resolution_clock

(C++11)

the clock with the shortest tick period available 
(class)

file_clock

(C++20)

Clock used for file time 
(typedef)

file_time_type

(C++17)

represents file time values 
(typedef)
