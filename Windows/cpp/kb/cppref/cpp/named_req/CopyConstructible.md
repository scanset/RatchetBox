Specifies that an instance of the type can be copy-constructed from an lvalue expression.

### Requirements

The type T satisfies CopyConstructible if

- The type T satisfies MoveConstructible, and

Given

- v, an lvalue expression of type T or const T or an rvalue expression of type const T,

- u, an arbitrary identifier.

The following expressions must be valid and have their specified effects:

Expression
Post-conditions

T u = v;

The value of u is equivalent to the value of v.
The value of v is unchanged.

T(v)

The value of T(v) is equivalent to the value of v.
The value of v is unchanged.

The expression v.~T() also must be valid, and, for lvalue v, the expression &v must have the type T* or const T* and must evaluate to the address of v.

(until C++11)

### Notes

Until C++11, classes that overloaded operator& were not CopyConstructible and thus were not usable in the standard library containers. This is a design decision in C++98 (instead of a defect, see LWG issue 390).

Since C++11, the standard library uses std::addressof whenever the address of an object is needed.

Extended content

Being a CopyConstructible class implies std::is_copy_constructible but not vice versa since std::is_copy_constructible will only check for the ability to call the constructor with the correct arguments, and, e.g., not a MoveConstructible requirement.

Run this code

#include <type_traits>
#include <utility>
 
struct S
{
S() = default;
S(S&&) = delete;
S(const S&) = default;
};
static_assert(std::is_copy_constructible_v<S>);
 
int main()
{
S s1;
 
// Class `S` doesn't satisfy MoveConstructible requirement,
// hence doesn't satisfy CopyConstructible requirement
[[maybe_unused]] S s2{std::move(s1)}; // ill-formed, use of deleted function
}
