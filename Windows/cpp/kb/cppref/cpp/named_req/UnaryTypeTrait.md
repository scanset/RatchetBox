A UnaryTypeTrait is a class template that describes a property of its template type parameter with an std::integral_constant (typically std::bool_constant) specialization.

### Requirements

- DefaultConstructible and CopyConstructible.

- Takes one template type parameter (additional template parameters are optional and allowed).

- Publicly and unambiguously derived from a specialization of std::integral_constant, known as its base characteristic.

- The member names of the base characteristic are not hidden and are unambiguously available.

### Standard library

The following type traits all satisfy UnaryTypeTrait:

- Primary type categories

- Composite type categories

- Type properties

- Supported operations

- Property queries

The following standard library class templates also satisfy UnaryTypeTrait.

integral_constant

(C++11)

compile-time constant of specified type with specified value 
(class template)

negation

(C++17)

logical NOT metafunction 
(class template)

std::tuple_size<std::tuple>

(C++11)

obtains the size of
a tuple 
(class template specialization) 

std::tuple_size<std::array>

(C++11)

obtains the size of an array 
(class template specialization)

std::tuple_size<std::pair>

(C++11)

obtains the size of a pair 
(class template specialization)

variant_sizevariant_size_v

(C++17)

obtains the size of the variant's list of alternatives at compile time
(class template) (variable template)

is_bind_expression

(C++11)

indicates that an object is std::bind expression or can be used as one 
(class template)

is_placeholder

(C++11)

indicates that an object is a standard placeholder or can be used as one 
(class template)

is_execution_policy

(C++17)

test whether a class represents an execution policy 
(class template)
