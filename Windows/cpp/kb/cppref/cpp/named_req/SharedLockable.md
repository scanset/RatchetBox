The SharedLockable requirements describe the minimal characteristics of types that provide shared blocking semantics for execution agents (i.e. threads).

### Requirements

For type L to be SharedLockable, the following conditions have to be satisfied for an object m of type L:

Expression
Preconditions
Effects
Return value

m.lock_shared()

Blocks until a lock can be obtained for the current execution agent (thread, process, task). If an exception is thrown, no lock is obtained.

m.try_lock_shared()

Attempts to obtain a lock for the current execution agent (thread, process, task) without blocking. If an exception is thrown, no lock is obtained.

true if the lock was obtained, false otherwise

m.unlock_shared()

The current execution agent holds a shared lock on m.

Releases the shared lock held by the execution agent.
Throws no exceptions.

#### Shared locks

A lock on an object is said to be shared lock if it is acquired by a call to lock_shared, try_lock_shared, try_lock_shared_for, or try_lock_shared_until member function.

### Standard library

The following standard library types satisfy SharedLockable requirements:

shared_mutex

(C++17)

provides shared mutual exclusion facility 
(class)

shared_timed_mutex

(C++14)

provides shared mutual exclusion facility and implements locking with a timeout 
(class)
