The type must work with == operator and the result should have standard semantics.

### Requirements

The type T satisfies EqualityComparable if given expressions a, b and c of type T or (since C++11) const T, the following expression is valid and has its specified effects:

Effects

a == b

meets BooleanTestable
(until C++20)

Establishes an equivalence relation, that is, it satisfies the following properties:

- For all values of a, a == a yields true. 

- If a == b, then b == a.

- If a == b and b == c, then a == c.

models boolean-testable
(since C++20)

### Notes

To satisfy this requirement, types that do not have built-in comparison operators have to provide a user-defined operator==.

For the types that are both EqualityComparable and LessThanComparable, the C++ standard library makes a distinction between

- Equality, which is the value of the expression a == b and

- Equivalence, which is the value of the expression !(a < b) && !(b < a).
