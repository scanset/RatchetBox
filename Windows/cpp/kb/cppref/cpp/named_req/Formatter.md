Formatter is a type that abstracts formatting operations for a given formatting argument type and character type. Specializations of std::formatter provided by the standard library are required to meet the requirements of Formatter except as noted otherwise.

A Formatter is able to format both const and non-const arguments, typically by providing a format member function that takes a const reference.

### Requirements

A type satisfies Formatter if it satisfies BasicFormatter and given the following types and values, the expressions shown in the table below are valid and have the indicated semantics:

Type

Definition

CharT

a character type

Arg

a formatting argument type

Formatter

a Formatter type for types Arg and CharT

OutputIt

a LegacyOutputIterator type

ParseCtx

std::basic_format_parse_context<CharT>

FmtCtx

std::basic_format_context<OutputIt, CharT>

Value

Definition

f

a value of type (possibly const-qualified) Formatter

arg

an lvalue of type Arg

t

a value of type convertible to (possibly const-qualified) Arg

parse_ctx

an lvalue of type ParseCtx satisfying all following conditions:

- parse_ctx.begin() points to the beginning of the format-spec of the replacement field being formatted in the format string.

- If format-spec is not present or empty, then either parse_ctx.begin() == parse_ctx.end() or *parse_ctx.begin() == '}'.

fmt_ctx

an lvalue of type FmtCtx

Expression

Return type

Semantics

f.format(t, fmt_ctx)

FmtCtx::iterator 

- Formats t according to the specifiers stored in f, writes the output to fmt_ctx.out() and returns an end iterator of the output range.

- The output can only depend on
t,

- fmt_ctx.locale(),

- the range [parse_ctx.begin(), parse_ctx.end()) from the last call to f.parse(parse_ctx), and

- fmt_ctx.arg(n) for any value n of type std::size_t.

f.format(arg, fmt_ctx)

FmtCtx::iterator

As above, but does not modify arg.
