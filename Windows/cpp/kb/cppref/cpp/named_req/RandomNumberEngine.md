A random number engine is a function object returning unsigned integer values such that each value in the range of possible results has (ideally) equal probability.

Any random number engine is also a UniformRandomBitGenerator, and therefore may be plugged into any random number distribution in order to obtain a random number (formally, a random variate).

### Requirements

A type satisfies RandomNumberEngine if it satisfies UniformRandomBitGenerator and, given the following types and values, the semantic and complexity requirements in the table below are satisfied:

Type

Definition

E

a RandomNumberEngine type

T

E::result_type

Value

Definition

e

a value of type E

v

an lvalue of type E

x, y

values of type (possibly const-qualified) E

s

a value of type T

q

a SeedSequence lvalue

z

a value of type unsigned long long

os

an lvalue whose type is a specialization of std::basic_ostream

is

an lvalue whose type is a specialization of std::basic_istream

n

the size of E's state

TA

the transition algorithm of E

GA

the generation algorithm of E

Expression

Return type

Semantics

Complexity

E()

N/A

Creates an engine with the same initial state as all other default-constructed engines of type E.

\(\scriptsize O(n)\)O(n)

E(x)

Creates an engine that compares equal to x.

\(\scriptsize O(n)\)O(n)

E(s)

Creates an engine whose initial state is determined by s.

\(\scriptsize O(n)\)O(n)

E(q)

Creates an engine whose initial state is determined by a single call to q.generate.

same as the complexity of q.generate called on a sequence whose length is n

e.seed()

void

Postcondition: e == E().

same as E()

e.seed(s)

void

Postcondition: e == E(s).

same as E(s)

e.seed(q)

void

Postcondition: e == E(q).

same as E(q)

e()

T

Advances e’s state from ei to ei+1 (i.e. TA(ei)) and returns GA(ei).

amortized constant

e.discard(z)

void

Advances e’s state from ei to ei+z by any means equivalent to z consecutive calls of e().

no worse than the complexity of z consecutive calls of e()

x == y

bool

For all positive integer i, if the ith consecutive calls of x() and y() return the same value, returns true. Otherwise returns false.

\(\scriptsize O(n)\)O(n)

x != y

bool

!(x == y)

\(\scriptsize O(n)\)O(n)

os << x

decltype(os)& 

With fmtflags set to std::ios_base::dec | std::ios_base::left and the fill character set to the space character, writes to os the textual representation of x's current state.Postcondition: os's fmtflags and the fill character are the same as before.

\(\scriptsize O(n)\)O(n)

is >> v

decltype(is)&

With fmtflags set to std::ios_base::dec, reads from is the textual representation of v's current state. If bad input is encountered, ensures that v’s state is unchanged by the operation and calls is.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit) (which may throw std::ios_base::failure).Precondition: is provides a textual representation that was previously written using an output stream pr satisfying all following conditions:

- is.getloc() == pr.getloc() is true.

- std::is_same<decltype(is)::char_type,
             decltype(pr)::char_type>::value is true.

- std::is_same<decltype(is)::traits_type,
             decltype(pr)::traits_type>::value is true.

Postcondition: is's fmtflags are the same as before.

\(\scriptsize O(n)\)O(n)
