The Clock requirements describe a bundle consisting of a std::chrono::duration, a std::chrono::time_point, and a function now() to get the current time_point. The origin of the clock's time_point is referred to as the clock's epoch.

### Requirements

C1 and C2 denote clock types. t1 and t2 are values returned by C1::now() where the call returning t1 happens before the call returning t2 and both of these calls occur before C1::time_point::max().

Expression
Return type
Operational semantics

C1::rep

An arithmetic type or a class emulating an arithmetic type

The representation type of C1::duration.

C1::period

A specialization of std::ratio

The tick period of the clock in seconds.

C1::duration

std::chrono::duration<C1::rep, C1::period>

The duration type of the clock.

C1::time_point

std::chrono::time_point<C1> or std::chrono::time_point<C2, C1::duration>

The std::chrono::time_point type of the clock. C1 and C2 shall refer to the same epoch.

C1::is_steady

const bool

true if t1 <= t2 is always true and the clock advances at a steady rate relative to real time (so the difference between two distinct reported times is approximately the elapsed real time between the clock updates), otherwise false

C1::now()

C1::time_point

Returns a time_point object representing the current point in time.
