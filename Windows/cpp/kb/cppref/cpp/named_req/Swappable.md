Any lvalue or rvalue of this type can be swapped with any lvalue or rvalue of some other type, using unqualified function call swap() in the context where both std::swap and the user-defined swap()s are visible.

### Requirements

Type U is swappable with type T if, for any object u of type U and any object t of type T,

Expression
Requirements
Semantics

#include <algorithm> // until C++11

#include <utility> // since C++11

using std::swap;

swap(u, t);

After the call, the value of t is the value held by u before the call, and the value of u is the value held by t before the call.

Calls the function named swap() found by overload resolution among all functions with that name that are found by argument-dependent lookup and the two std::swap templates defined in the header <algorithm>(until C++11)<utility>(since C++11).

#include <algorithm> // until C++11

#include <utility> // since C++11

using std::swap;

swap(t, u);

Many standard library functions (for example, many algorithms) expect their arguments to satisfy Swappable, which means that any time the standard library performs a swap, it uses the equivalent of using std::swap; swap(t, u);.

Typical implementations either

1) Define a non-member swap in the enclosing namespace, which may forward to a member swap if access to non-public data members is required.

2) Define a friend function in-class (this approach hides the class-specific swap from name lookup other than ADL).

### Notes

It is unspecified whether <algorithm>(until C++11)<utility>(since C++11) is actually included when the standard library functions perform the swap, so the user-provided swap() should not expect it to be included.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
 
struct IntVector
{
std::vector<int> v;
 
IntVector& operator=(IntVector) = delete; // not assignable
 
void swap(IntVector& other)
{
v.swap(other.v);
}
 
void operator()(auto rem, auto term = " ")
{
std::cout << rem << "{{";
for (int n{}; int e : v)
std::cout << (n++ ? ", " : "") << e;
std::cout << "}}" << term;
}
};
 
void swap(IntVector& v1, IntVector& v2)
{
v1.swap(v2);
}
 
int main()
{
IntVector v1{{1, 1, 1, 1}}, v2{{2222, 2222}};
 
auto prn = [&]{ v1("v1", ", "), v2("v2", ";\n"); };
 
// std::swap(v1, v2); // Compiler error! std::swap requires MoveAssignable
prn();
std::iter_swap(&v1, &v2); // OK: library calls unqualified swap()
prn();
std::ranges::swap(v1, v2); // OK: library calls unqualified swap()
prn();
}

Output:

v1{{1, 1, 1, 1}}, v2{{2222, 2222}};
v1{{2222, 2222}}, v2{{1, 1, 1, 1}};
v1{{1, 1, 1, 1}}, v2{{2222, 2222}};
