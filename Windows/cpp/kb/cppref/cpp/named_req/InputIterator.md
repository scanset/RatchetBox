A LegacyInputIterator is a LegacyIterator that can read from the pointed-to element. LegacyInputIterators only guarantee validity for single pass algorithms: once a LegacyInputIterator i has been incremented, all copies of its previous value may be invalidated.

### Requirements

Type

Definition

X

An input iterator type

T

The value type of X (i.e. std::iterator_traits<X>::value_type)

R

std::iterator_traits<X>::reference

Value

Definition

i, j

Values of type X or const X

r

A value of type X&

Other

Definition

m

An identifier which possibly denotes a data member or member function

X satisfies LegacyInputIterator if all following conditions are satisfied:

- X satisfies LegacyIterator.

- X satisfies EqualityComparable.

- The following expressions are well-formed and have the specified semantics:

Expression 

Type

Semantics

i != j

a type satisfying BooleanTestable
(until C++20)

a type modeling boolean-testable
(since C++20)

Precondition

i and j are in the domain of ==.

Effect

Equivalent to !(i == j).

*i

R, convertible to T

Precondition

i is dereferenceable.

Effect

- The expression (void)*i, *i is equivalent to *i.

- If i and j are in the domain of ==, and i == j, then *i is equivalent to *j.

i->m

Precondition

i is dereferenceable.

Effect

Equivalent to (*i).m.

++r

X&

Precondition

r is dereferenceable.

Postcondition 

- r is dereferenceable or r is past-the-end.

- Any copies of the previous value of r are no longer required to be either dereferenceable or to be in the domain of ==.

(void)r++

Effect

Equivalent to (void)++r.

*r++

convertible to T

Effect

Equivalent to T x = *r; ++r; return x;.

### Equality domain

The term the domain of == is used in the ordinary mathematical sense to denote the set of values which can be compared using ==. This set can change over time.

Each algorithm places additional requirements on the equality domain for the iterator values it uses. These requirements can be inferred from the uses that algorithm makes of == and !=.

### Notes

For an input iterator X that is not a LegacyForwardIterator, std::iterator_traits<X>::reference does not have to be a reference type: dereferencing an input iterator may return a proxy object or std::iterator_traits<X>::value_type itself by value (as in the case of std::istreambuf_iterator).

### Concept

For the definition of std::iterator_traits, the following exposition-only concept is defined.

template<class I>

concept __LegacyInputIterator =

__LegacyIterator<I> && std::equality_comparable<I> && requires(I i)

{

    typename std::incrementable_traits<I>::difference_type;

    typename std::indirectly_readable_traits<I>::value_type;

    typename std::common_reference_t<std::iter_reference_t<I>&&,

                                     typename std::indirectly_readable_traits<I>::value_type&>;

    *i++;

    typename std::common_reference_t<decltype(*i++)&&,

                                     typename std::indirectly_readable_traits<I>::value_type&>;

    requires std::signed_integral<typename std::incrementable_traits<I>::difference_type>;

};

where the exposition-only concept __LegacyIterator is described in LegacyIterator.

(since C++20)
