Notes

- ↑ For an expression whose effect is equivalent to some other operations, the conditions of the expressions inside those operations are inherited on top of the conditions listed in the table.

- ↑ std::array supports assignment from a brace-enclosed initializer list, but not from an std::initializer_list.

- ↑ All operations below except prepend_range and append_range(since C++23) take amortized constant time.

- ↑ In C++98, tmp was declared to have type C::iterator.

- ↑ In C++98, tmp was declared to have type C::const_iterator.

- ↑ 6.0 6.1 Insertion order, relative to order of elements in rg, is non-reversing.

Additionally, for every sequence container:

- A constructor template that takes two input iterators and the member function template overloads of insert, append, assign, replace that take two input iterators do not participate in overload resolution if the corresponding template argument does not satisfy LegacyInputIterator.

- A deduction guide that has either a LegacyInputIterator or an Allocator template parameter does not participate in overload resolution if the type that does not qualify as an input iterator or an allocator respectively is deduced for that parameter.

(since C++17)

Container

Cons

std::vector

Fixed capacity and mostly inefficient insertions/deletions

std::array

Fast access, inplace contiguous storage

Fixed number of elements and no insertion/deletion

std::deque

std::list
std::forward_list

Efficient insertion/deletion in the middle of the sequence

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

DR

Applied to

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

LWG 139

C++98

the optional operations were not required to
be implemented for the designated containers

required with amortized time

LWG 149

C++98

v.insert(p, t) returned Iter while
v.insert(p, n, t) and v.insert(p, n, t) returned void

they all return Iter

LWG 151

C++98

q1 was required to be dereferenceable[1]

it can be non-dereferenceable

LWG 355

C++98

calling v.back() or v.pop_back() would
execute --v.end(), which is dangerous[2]

decrements a copy
of v.end() instead

LWG 589

C++98

the elements that i and j refer to
might not be convertible to C::value_type

they are implicitly
convertible to C::value_type

LWG 2194

C++11

std::queue, std::priority_queue and
std::stack were also SequenceContainers[3]

they are not SequenceContainers

LWG 2231

C++11

the complexity requirement of v.clear()
was mistakenly omitted in C++11

complexity reaffirmed as linear

LWG 3927

C++98

operator[] had no implicit requirement

added the implicit requirement

- ↑ It is a defect because it makes the behavior of v.erase(v.begin(), v.end()) undefined is v is an empty container.

- ↑ If the type of v.end() is a fundamental type, --v.end() is ill-formed. It is dangerous when the type of v is templated, in this case this bug can be difficult to be found.

- ↑ They were not documented as SequenceContainers in C++98.
