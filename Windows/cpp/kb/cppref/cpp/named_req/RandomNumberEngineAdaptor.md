A RandomNumberEngineAdaptor is a RandomNumberEngine that transforms the output of another RandomNumberEngine, the latter of which is termed a base engine.

### Requirements

Given

- B, a RandomNumberEngine

- b, an object of type B

- A, a RandomNumberEngineAdaptor, adapting B as a base engine

- a, an object of type A

function
semantics

A::A();
The base engine is initialized as if by its default constructor.

bool operator==(const A& lhs, const A& rhs);
Returns whether lhs's base engine is equal to rhs's base engine or not.

A::A(result_type s);
The base engine is initialized with s.

template<class Sseq> A::A(Sseq& q);
The base engine is initialized with q.

void seed();
Invokes b.seed().

void seed(result_type s);
Invokes b.seed(s).

template<class Sseq> void seed(Sseq& q);
Invokes b.seed(q).

Furthermore

- The complexity of each function of A does not exceed the complexity of the function of B

- The state of A includes the state of B

- The size of A's state is no less than the size of b

- Copying A's state includes copying B's state

- The textual representation of A includes the textual representation of B

### Standard library

The following standard library facilities satisfy RandomNumberEngineAdaptor:

discard_block_engine

(C++11)

discards some output of a random number engine 
(class template)

independent_bits_engine

(C++11)

packs the output of a random number engine into blocks of a specified number of bits 
(class template)

shuffle_order_engine

(C++11)

delivers the output of a random number engine in a different order 
(class template)
