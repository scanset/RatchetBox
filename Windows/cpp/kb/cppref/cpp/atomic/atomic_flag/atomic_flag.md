constexpr atomic_flag() noexcept;

(since C++20)

atomic_flag( const atomic_flag& ) = delete;

(2)
(since C++11)

Constructs a new std::atomic_flag. 

1) Trivial default constructor, initializes std::atomic_flag to unspecified state.

(until C++20)

1) Initializes std::atomic_flag to clear state.

(since C++20)

2) The copy constructor is deleted; std::atomic_flag is not copyable.

In addition, std::atomic_flag can be value-initialized to clear state with the expression ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT. For an atomic_flag with static storage duration, this guarantees static initialization: the flag can be used in constructors of static objects.
