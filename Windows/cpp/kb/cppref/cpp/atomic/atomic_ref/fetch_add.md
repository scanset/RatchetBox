Provided only when T is an arithmetic type other than cv bool or a pointer-to-object type

value_type fetch_add( difference_type arg,

                      std::memory_order order =

std::memory_order_seq_cst ) const noexcept;

(constexpr since C++26)

Atomically replaces the current value referenced by *ptr with the result of arithmetic addition of the value and arg. This operation is a read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the value of order.

- For signed integral types, arithmetic is defined to use two’s complement representation. There are no undefined results.

- For floating-point types, the floating-point environment in effect may be different from the calling thread's floating-point environment. The operation need not be conform to the corresponding std::numeric_limits traits but is encouraged to do so. If the result is not a representable value for its type, the result is unspecified but the operation otherwise has no undefined behavior.

- For pointer types, the result may be an undefined address, but the operation otherwise has no undefined behavior.
If std::remove_pointer_t<T> is not a complete object type, the program is ill-formed.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_const_v<T> is false.
