Provided only when T is an integral type other than cv bool or a pointer-to-object type

value_type fetch_min( value_type arg,

                      std::memory_order order =

std::memory_order_seq_cst ) const noexcept;

(since C++26)

Atomically replaces the current value of the referenced object with the result of std::min of the value and arg. That is, it performs atomic minimum operation. The operation is a read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the value of order.

If T is a pointer type and the pointers point to different complete objects (or subobjects thereof), pointer comparison does not establish a strict weak ordering.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_const_v<T> is false.

### Parameters

arg

-

the other argument of std::min

order

-

memory order constraints to enforce

### Return value

The value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification order of *this.
