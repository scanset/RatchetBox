Provided only when T is an integral type other than cv bool

value_type fetch_xor( value_type arg,

                      std::memory_order order =

std::memory_order_seq_cst ) const noexcept;

(since C++20)

Atomically replaces the current value of the referenced object with the result of bitwise XOR of the value and arg. This operation is a read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the value of order.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_const_v<T> is false.

### Parameters

arg

-

the other argument of bitwise XOR

order

-

memory order constraints to enforce

### Return value

The value of the referenced object, immediately preceding the effects of this function.

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
