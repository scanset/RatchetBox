Atomically compares the value representation of the referenced object with that of expected, and if those are bitwise-equal, replaces the former with desired (performs a read-modify-write operation). Otherwise, loads the actual value stored in the referenced object into expected (performs a load operation).

1,3) The memory models for the read-modify-write and load operations are success and failure respectively.

2,4) order is used for both read-modify-write and load operations, except that std::memory_order_acquire and std::memory_order_relaxed are used for the load operation if order is std::memory_order_acq_rel or std::memory_order_release respectively.

These overloads participate in overload resolution only if std::is_const_v<T> is false.

If failure is not std::memory_order_relaxed, std::memory_order_consume, std::memory_order_acquire or std::memory_order_seq_cst, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

expected

-

reference to the value expected to be found in the object referenced by the atomic_ref object

desired

-

the value to store in the referenced object if it is as expected

success

-

the memory synchronization ordering for the read-modify-write operation if the comparison succeeds

failure

-

the memory synchronization ordering for the load operation if the comparison fails

order

-

the memory synchronization ordering for both operations

### Return value

true if the referenced object was successfully changed, false otherwise.

### Notes

The comparison and copying are bitwise (similar to std::memcmp and std::memcpy); no constructor, assignment operator, or comparison operator are used.

The weak forms (1,2) of the functions are allowed to fail spuriously, that is, act as if *this != expected even if they are equal. When a compare-and-exchange is in a loop, the weak version will yield better performance on some platforms.

When a weak compare-and-exchange would require a loop and a strong one would not, the strong one is preferable unless the object representation of value_type may include trap bits, or offers multiple object representations for the same value (e.g. floating-point NaN). In those cases, weak compare-and-exchange typically works because it quickly converges on some stable object representation.

For a union with bits that participate in the value representations of some members but not the others, compare-and-exchange might always fail because such padding bits have indeterminate values when they do not participate in the value representation of the active member.

Padding bits that never participate in an object's value representation are ignored.
