void store( value_type desired,

            std::memory_order order =

std::memory_order_seq_cst ) const noexcept;

(constexpr since C++26)

Atomically replaces the current value of the referenced object with desired. Memory is affected according to the value of order.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_const_v<T> is false.

If order is not std::memory_order_relaxed, std::memory_order_release or std::memory_order_seq_cst, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

desired

-

the value to store into the referenced object

order

-

memory order constraints to enforce
