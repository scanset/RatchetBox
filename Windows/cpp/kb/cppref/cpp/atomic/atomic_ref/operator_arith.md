Atomically increments or decrements the current value of the referenced object. These operations are read-modify-write operations. 

1) Performs atomic pre-increment. Equivalent to return fetch_add(1) + 1;.

2) Performs atomic post-increment. Equivalent to return fetch_add(1);.

3) Performs atomic pre-decrement. Equivalent to return fetch_sub(1) - 1;

4) Performs atomic post-decrement. Equivalent to return fetch_sub(1);.

- For signed integral types, arithmetic is defined to use two’s complement representation. There are no undefined results. 

- For pointer-to-object types, the result may be an undefined address, but the operations otherwise have no undefined behavior. The program is ill-formed if std::remove_pointer_t<T> is not a complete object type.

These overloads participate in overload resolution only if std::is_const_v<T> is false.

### Return value

1,3) The value of the referenced object after the modification.

2,4) The value of the referenced object before the modification.

### Notes

Unlike most pre-increment and pre-decrement operators, the pre-increment and pre-decrement operators for atomic_ref do not return a reference to the modified object. They return a copy of the stored value instead.
