static constexpr std::size_t required_alignment = /*implementation-defined*/;

(since C++20)

The value of required_alignment is the required alignment for an object to be referenced by an atomic reference, which is at least alignof(T).

### Notes

Hardware could require that an object to be referenced by an atomic_ref<T> have stricter alignment than other T objects, and whether operations on an atomic_ref are lock-free can depend on the alignment of the referenced object.
