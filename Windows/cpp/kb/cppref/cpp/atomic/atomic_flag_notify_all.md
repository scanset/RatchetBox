void atomic_flag_notify_all( volatile std::atomic_flag* object ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++20)

Performs atomic notifying operations.

Unblocks all threads blocked in atomic waiting operations (i.e. std::atomic_flag_wait(), std::atomic_flag_wait_explicit(), or std::atomic_flag::wait()) on *object, if there are any; otherwise does nothing.

Equivalent to object->notify_all().

### Parameters

object

-

pointer to the atomic_flag object to notify

### Return value

(none)

### Notes

This form of change-detection is often more efficient than simple polling or pure spinlocks.
