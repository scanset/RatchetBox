void atomic_notify_all( volatile std::atomic<T>* object );

(2)
(since C++20)

Performs atomic notifying operations.

Unblocks all threads blocked in atomic waiting operations (i.e. std::atomic_wait(), std::atomic_wait_explicit(), or std::atomic::wait()) on *object, if there are any; otherwise does nothing.

Equivalent to object->notify_all().

### Parameters
