Atomically replaces the current value with the result of arithmetic subtraction of the value and arg. That is, it performs atomic post-decrement. The operation is read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the value of order.

1,2) For signed integral types, arithmetic is defined to use two’s complement representation. There are no undefined results.

For floating-point types, the floating-point environment in effect may be different from the calling thread's floating-point environment. The operation need not be conform to the corresponding std::numeric_limits traits but is encouraged to do so. If the result is not a representable value for its type, the result is unspecified but the operation otherwise has no undefined behavior.

(since C++20)

3,4) The result may be an undefined address, but the operation otherwise has no undefined behavior.

If T is not a complete object type, the program is ill-formed.

It is deprecated if std::atomic<T>::is_always_lock_free is false and overload (2) or (4) participates in overload resolution.
