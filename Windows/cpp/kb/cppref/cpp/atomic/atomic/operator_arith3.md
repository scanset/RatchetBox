Atomically replaces the current value with the result of computation involving the previous value and arg. The operation is read-modify-write operation.

- operator&= performs atomic bitwise and. Equivalent to return fetch_and(arg) & arg;.

- operator|= performs atomic bitwise or. Equivalent to return fetch_or(arg) | arg;.

- operator^= performs atomic bitwise exclusive or. Equivalent to return fetch_xor(arg) ^ arg;.

It is deprecated if std::atomic<T>::is_always_lock_free is false and any volatile overload participates in overload resolution.

(since C++20)

### Parameters

arg

-

the argument for the arithmetic operation

### Return value

The resulting value (that is, the result of applying the corresponding binary operator to the value immediately preceding the effects of the corresponding member function in the modification order of *this).

### Notes

Unlike most compound assignment operators, the compound assignment operators for atomic types do not return a reference to their left-hand arguments. They return a copy of the stored value instead.
