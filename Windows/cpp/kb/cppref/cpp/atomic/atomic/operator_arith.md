Atomically increments or decrements the current value. The operation is read-modify-write operation.

- operator++() performs atomic pre-increment. Equivalent to return fetch_add(1) + 1;.

- operator++(int) performs atomic post-increment. Equivalent to return fetch_add(1);.

- operator--() performs atomic pre-decrement. Equivalent to return fetch_sub(1) - 1;.

- operator--(int) performs atomic post-decrement. Equivalent to return fetch_sub(1);.

1-8) For signed integral types, arithmetic is defined to use two’s complement representation. There are no undefined results.

9-16) The result may be an undefined address, but the operations otherwise have no undefined behavior.

If T is not a complete object type, the program is ill-formed.

It is deprecated if std::atomic<T>::is_always_lock_free is false and any volatile overload participates in overload resolution.

(since C++20)

### Return value

operator++() and operator--() return the value of the atomic variable after the modification. Formally, the result of incrementing/decrementing the value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification order of *this.

operator++(int) and operator--(int) return the value of the atomic variable before the modification. Formally, the value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification order of *this.

### Notes

Unlike most pre-increment and pre-decrement operators, the pre-increment and pre-decrement operators for atomic types do not return a reference to the modified object. They return a copy of the stored value instead.

### Example

Run this code

#include <atomic>
#include <chrono>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <random>
#include <string>
#include <thread>
 
std::atomic<int> atomic_count{0};
 
std::mutex cout_mutex;
int completed_writes{0};
 
constexpr int global_max_count{72};
constexpr int writes_per_line{8};
constexpr int max_delay{100};
 
template<int Max>
int random_value()
{
static std::uniform_int_distribution<int> distr{1, Max};
static std::random_device engine;
static std::mt19937 noise{engine()};
static std::mutex rand_mutex;
std::lock_guard lock{rand_mutex};
return distr(noise);
}
 
int main()
{
auto work = [](const std::string id)
{
for (int count{}; (count = ++atomic_count) <= global_max_count;)
{
std::this_thread::sleep_for(
std::chrono::milliseconds(random_value<max_delay>()));
 
// print thread `id` and `count` value
{
std::lock_guard lock{cout_mutex};
 
const bool new_line = ++completed_writes % writes_per_line == 0;
 
std::cout << id << std::setw(3) << count << " "
<< (new_line ? "\n" : "") << std::flush;
}
}
};
 
std::jthread j1(work, "░"), j2(work, "▒"), j3(work, "▓"), j4(work, "█");
}

Possible output:

▒ 2 ░ 1 ▒ 5 ▒ 7 █ 4 ░ 6 ▓ 3 ▒ 8 
▓ 11 █ 9 ▓ 13 ░ 10 █ 14 ▒ 12 ░ 16 ░ 19 
▓ 15 ▒ 18 ▓ 21 ▒ 22 █ 17 █ 25 ▒ 24 █ 26 
░ 20 ░ 29 ▒ 27 ▓ 23 ▒ 31 ▒ 33 ▓ 32 █ 28 
░ 30 ░ 37 ▒ 34 ▓ 35 █ 36 █ 41 ▓ 40 ▒ 39 
░ 38 ▓ 43 █ 42 ▓ 46 ▓ 48 █ 47 █ 50 ░ 45 
▒ 44 ▒ 53 ▒ 54 ▓ 49 ▒ 55 █ 51 ▒ 57 █ 58 
░ 52 ▓ 56 ░ 61 ▒ 59 █ 60 ▓ 62 ▒ 64 ░ 63 
░ 68 ▓ 66 █ 65 █ 71 ▒ 67 ▓ 70 ░ 69 █ 72
