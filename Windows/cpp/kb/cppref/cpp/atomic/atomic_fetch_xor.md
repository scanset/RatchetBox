(4)
(since C++11)

Atomically replaces the value pointed by obj with the result of bitwise XOR between the old value of obj and arg. Returns the value obj held previously. 

The operation is performed as if the following is executed:

1,2) obj->fetch_xor(arg)

3,4) obj->fetch_xor(arg, order)

If std::atomic<T> has no fetch_xor member (this member is only provided for integral types except bool), the program is ill-formed.

### Parameters

obj

-

pointer to the atomic object to modify

arg

-

the value to bitwise XOR to the value stored in the atomic object

order

-

the memory synchronization ordering

### Return value

The value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification order of *obj.

exact type match was required because
T was deduced from multiple arguments

T is only deduced
from obj
