Defined in header <atomic>

extern "C" void atomic_signal_fence( std::memory_order order ) noexcept;

(since C++11)

Establishes memory synchronization ordering of non-atomic and relaxed atomic accesses, as instructed by order, between a thread and a signal handler executed on the same thread. This is equivalent to std::atomic_thread_fence, except no CPU instructions for memory ordering are issued. Only reordering of the instructions by the compiler is suppressed as order instructs. For example, a fence with release semantics prevents reads or writes from being moved past subsequent writes and a fence with acquire semantics prevents reads or writes from being moved ahead of preceding reads.
