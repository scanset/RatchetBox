void atomic_flag_wait_explicit( const volatile atomic_flag* object,

(4)
(since C++20)

Performs atomic waiting operations.

Compares object->test(std::memory_order_seq_cst) or object->test(order) with old, and if they are equal then blocks until *object is notified by std::atomic_flag::notify_one() or std::atomic_flag::notify_all() (or the thread is unblocked spuriously). This is repeated until the values compare unequal.

1,2) The memory synchronization order is std::memory_order_seq_cst.

3,4) The memory synchronization order is order.

If order is one of std::memory_order_release and std::memory_order_acq_rel, the behavior is undefined.

These functions are guaranteed to return only if value has changed, even if underlying implementation unblocks spuriously.

### Parameters

object

-

pointer to the atomic flag to check and wait on

old

-

the value to check the atomic flag no longer contains

order

-

the memory synchronization ordering

### Return value

(none)

### Notes

This form of change-detection is often more efficient than simple polling or pure spinlocks.

Due to the ABA problem, transient changes from old to another value and back to old might be missed, and not unblock.
