struct atomic_ref;

(since C++20)

The std::atomic_ref class template applies atomic operations to the object it references.

For the lifetime of the std::atomic_ref object, the object it references is considered an atomic object. If one thread writes to an atomic object while another thread reads from it, the behavior is well-defined (see memory model for details on data races). In addition, accesses to atomic objects may establish inter-thread synchronization and order non-atomic memory accesses as specified by std::memory_order.

The lifetime of an object must exceed the lifetime of all std::atomic_refs that references the object. While any std::atomic_ref instance referencing an object exists, the object must be exclusively accessed through these std::atomic_ref instances. No subobject of an object referenced by an std::atomic_ref object may be concurrently referenced by any other std::atomic_ref object.

Atomic operations applied to an object through an std::atomic_ref are atomic with respect to atomic operations applied through any other std::atomic_ref referencing the same object.

Like references in the core language, constness is shallow for std::atomic_ref - it is possible to modify the referenced value through a const std::atomic_ref object.

If any of the following conditions are satisfied, the program is ill-formed:

- std::is_trivially_copyable_v<T> is false.

- is_always_lock_free is false and std::is_volatile_v<T> is true.

std::atomic_ref is CopyConstructible.

value_type

std::remove_cv_t<T>

difference_type

- value_type, if T is an arithmetic type other than cv bool.

- Otherwise, std::ptrdiff_t, if T is a pointer-to-object type.

### Data members

Member

Description

T* ptr

the pointer to the referenced object
(exposition-only member object*)

is_always_lock_free

[static]

indicates that the type is always lock-free 
(public static member constant)

required_alignment

[static]

indicates the required alignment of an object to be referenced by atomic_ref 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs an atomic_ref object 
(public member function)

operator=

stores a value into the object referenced by an atomic_ref object 
(public member function)

is_lock_free

checks if the atomic_ref object is lock-free 
(public member function)

store

atomically replaces the value of the referenced object with a non-atomic argument 
(public member function)

load

atomically obtains the value of the referenced object 
(public member function)

operator value_type

loads a value from the referenced object 
(public member function)

exchange

atomically replaces the value of the referenced object and obtains the value held previously 
(public member function)

compare_exchange_weakcompare_exchange_strong

atomically compares the value of the referenced object with non-atomic argument and performs atomic exchange if equal or atomic load if not 
(public member function)

wait

blocks the thread until notified and the atomic value changes 
(public member function)

notify_one

notifies at least one thread waiting on the atomic object 
(public member function)

notify_all

notifies all threads blocked waiting on the atomic object 
(public member function)

address

(C++26)

returns the object's address 
(public member function)

#### Provided only when T is an arithmetic type other than cv bool or a pointer-to-object type 

fetch_add

atomically adds the argument to the value stored in the referenced object and obtains the value held previously 
(public member function)

fetch_sub

atomically subtracts the argument from the value stored in the referenced object and obtains the value held previously 
(public member function)

operator+=operator-=

atomically adds to or subtracts from the referenced value 
(public member function)

#### Provided only when T is an integral type other than cv bool or a pointer-to-object type 

fetch_max

(C++26)

atomically performs std::max between the argument and the value of the referenced object and obtains the value held previously 
(public member function)

fetch_min

(C++26)

atomically performs std::min between the argument and the value of the referenced object and obtains the value held previously 
(public member function)

operator++operator++(int)operator--operator--(int)

atomically increments or decrements the referenced object by one 
(public member function)

#### Provided only when T is an integral type other than cv bool 

fetch_and

atomically performs bitwise AND between the argument and the value of the referenced object and obtains the value held previously 
(public member function)

fetch_or

atomically performs bitwise OR between the argument and the value of the referenced object and obtains the value held previously 
(public member function)

fetch_xor

atomically performs bitwise XOR between the argument and the value of the referenced object and obtains the value held previously 
(public member function)

operator&=operator|=operator^=

atomically performs bitwise AND, OR, XOR with the referenced value 
(public member function)

### Specializations

The standard specifies that std::atomic_ref has following specializations:

template<>

struct atomic_ref</*integral-type*/>;

(1)
(since C++20)

template<>

struct atomic_ref</*floating-point-type*/>;

(2)
(since C++20)

template< class /*pointer-type*/ >

    requires /* see below */

struct atomic_ref</*pointer-type*/>;

(3)
(since C++20)

1) /*integral-type*/ denotes a possibly cv-qualified integral type other than cv bool.

2) /*floating-point-type*/ denotes a possibly cv-qualified floating-point type.

3) The partial specialization is provided for /*pointer-type*/ types that are possibly cv-qualified pointer-to-object types.

### Notes

Implementations may merge the specified specializations. E.g. MSVC STL merges all of them into the primary template.

When T is cv void or a function type, std::atomic_ref<T*> (i.e. std::atomic_ref<void*>, std::atomic_ref<int(*)()> etc.) does not have difference_type or any operation requiring pointer arithmetic or relational comparison(since C++26).
