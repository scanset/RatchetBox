1) The syntax_option_type is a BitmaskType that contains options that govern how regular expressions behave.

2,3) The possible values (icase, optimize, etc.) for type (1) are duplicated inside std::basic_regex.

### Constants

Grammar option

Effect(s)

ECMAScript

Use the Modified ECMAScript regular expression grammar.

basic

Use the basic POSIX regular expression grammar (grammar documentation).

extended

Use the extended POSIX regular expression grammar (grammar documentation).

awk

Use the regular expression grammar used by the awk utility in POSIX (grammar documentation).

grep

Use the regular expression grammar used by the grep utility in POSIX. This is effectively the same as the basic option with the addition of newline '\n' as an alternation separator.

egrep

Use the regular expression grammar used by the grep utility, with the -E option, in POSIX. This is effectively the same as the extended option with the addition of newline '\n' as an alternation separator in addition to '|'.

Grammar variation

Effect(s)

icase

Character matching should be performed without regard to case.

nosubs

When performing matches, all marked sub-expressions (expr) are treated as non-marking sub-expressions (?:expr). No matches are stored in the supplied std::regex_match structure and mark_count() is zero.

optimize

Instructs the regular expression engine to make matching faster, with the potential cost of making construction slower. For example, this might mean converting a non-deterministic FSA to a deterministic FSA.

collate

Character ranges of the form "[a-b]" will be locale sensitive.

multiline (C++17)

Specifies that ^ shall match the beginning of a line and $ shall match the end of a line, if the ECMAScript engine is selected.

At most one grammar option can be chosen out of ECMAScript, basic, extended, awk, grep, egrep. If no grammar is chosen, ECMAScript is assumed to be selected. The other options serve as variations, such that std::regex("meow", std::regex::icase) is equivalent to std::regex("meow", std::regex::ECMAScript|std::regex::icase).

### Notes

Because POSIX uses "leftmost longest" matching rule (the longest matching subsequence is matched, and if there are several such subsequences, the first one is matched), it is not suitable, for example, for parsing markup languages: a POSIX regex such as "<tag[^>]*>.*</tag>" would match everything from the first "<tag" to the last "</tag>", including every "</tag>" and "<tag>" in-between. On the other hand, ECMAScript supports non-greedy matches, and the ECMAScript regex "<tag[^>]*>.*?</tag>" would match only until the first closing tag.

### Example

Illustrates the difference in the matching algorithm between ECMAScript and POSIX regular expressions:

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <regex>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::string str = "zzxayyzz";
std::regex re1(".*(a|xayy)"); // ECMA
std::regex re2(".*(a|xayy)", std::regex::extended); // POSIX
 
std::cout << "Searching for .*(a|xayy) in zzxayyzz:\n";
std::smatch m;
std::regex_search(str, m, re1);
std::cout << " ECMA (depth first search) match: " << m[0] << '\n';
std::regex_search(str, m, re2);
std::cout << " POSIX (leftmost longest) match: " << m[0] << '\n';
}

Output:

Searching for .*(a|xayy) in zzxayyzz:
ECMA (depth first search) match: zzxa
POSIX (leftmost longest) match: zzxayy
