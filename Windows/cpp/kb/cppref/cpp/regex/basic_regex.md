(since C++11)

The class template basic_regex provides a general framework for holding regular expressions. 

Several typedefs for common character types are provided:

std::regex

std::basic_regex<char>

std::wregex

std::basic_regex<wchar_t>

### Member types

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs the regex object 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destructs the regex object 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns the contents 
(public member function)

assign

assigns the contents 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

mark_count

returns the number of marked sub-expressions within the regular expression 
(public member function)

flags

returns the syntax flags 
(public member function)

#### Locale 

getloc

get locale information 
(public member function)

imbue

set locale information 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

swap

swaps the contents 
(public member function)

### Constants

Grammar option

Effect(s)

ECMAScript

Use the Modified ECMAScript regular expression grammar.

basic

Use the basic POSIX regular expression grammar (grammar documentation).

extended

Use the extended POSIX regular expression grammar (grammar documentation).

awk

Use the regular expression grammar used by the awk utility in POSIX (grammar documentation).

grep

Use the regular expression grammar used by the grep utility in POSIX. This is effectively the same as the basic option with the addition of newline '\n' as an alternation separator.

egrep

Use the regular expression grammar used by the grep utility, with the -E option, in POSIX. This is effectively the same as the extended option with the addition of newline '\n' as an alternation separator in addition to '|'.

Grammar variation

Effect(s)

icase

Character matching should be performed without regard to case.

nosubs

When performing matches, all marked sub-expressions (expr) are treated as non-marking sub-expressions (?:expr). No matches are stored in the supplied std::regex_match structure and mark_count() is zero.

optimize

Instructs the regular expression engine to make matching faster, with the potential cost of making construction slower. For example, this might mean converting a non-deterministic FSA to a deterministic FSA.

collate

Character ranges of the form "[a-b]" will be locale sensitive.

multiline (C++17)

Specifies that ^ shall match the beginning of a line and $ shall match the end of a line, if the ECMAScript engine is selected.

At most one grammar option can be chosen out of ECMAScript, basic, extended, awk, grep, egrep. If no grammar is chosen, ECMAScript is assumed to be selected. The other options serve as variations, such that std::regex("meow", std::regex::icase) is equivalent to std::regex("meow", std::regex::ECMAScript|std::regex::icase).

The member constants in basic_regex are duplicates of the syntax_option_type constants defined in the namespace std::regex_constants.

### Non-member functions

std::swap(std::basic_regex)

(C++11)

specializes the std::swap algorithm 
(function template)
