regex_token_iterator& operator++();

(since C++11)

regex_token_iterator operator++( int );

(since C++11)

Advances the iterator on the next sub match.

This section is incomplete
Reason: Explain better. For example, subs is an exposition-only vector of matched sub-expressions.

If *this is a suffix iterator, sets *this to an end-of-sequence iterator.

Otherwise, if N + 1 < subs.size(), increments N and sets result to the address of the current match.

Otherwise, sets N to ​0​ and increments position. If position is not an end-of-sequence iterator the operator sets result to the address of the current match.

Otherwise, if any of the values stored in subs is equal to -1 and prev->suffix().length() is not ​0​ the operator sets *this to a suffix iterator that points to the range [prev->suffix().first, prev->suffix().second).

Otherwise, sets *this to an end-of-sequence iterator.

The behavior is undefined if the iterator is end-of-sequence iterator.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

1) *this

2) The previous value of the iterator.
