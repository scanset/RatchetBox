Defined in header <regex>

template< class BidirIt >

class sub_match;

(since C++11)

The class template std::sub_match is used by the regular expression engine to denote sequences of characters matched by marked sub-expressions.
A match is a [begin, end) pair within the target range matched by the regular expression, but with additional observer functions to enhance code clarity.

Only the default constructor is publicly accessible. Instances of std::sub_match are normally constructed and populated as a part of a std::match_results container during the processing of one of the regex algorithms.

The member functions return defined default values unless the matched member is true.

std::sub_match inherits from std::pair<BidirIt, BidirIt>, although it cannot be treated as a std::pair object because member functions such as assignment will not work as expected.

### Type requirements

-

BidirIt must meet the requirements of LegacyBidirectionalIterator.

### Specializations

Several specializations for common character sequence types are provided:

### Data members

Member

Description

bool matched

whether this match was successful 
(public member object)

## Inherited from std::pair

BidirIt first

start of the match sequence 
(public member object)

BidirIt second

one-past-the-end of the match sequence 
(public member object)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs the match object 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

length

returns the length of the match (if any) 
(public member function)

stroperator string_type

converts to the underlying string type 
(public member function)

compare

compares matched subsequence (if any) 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

swap

swaps the contents 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator!=operator<operator<=operator>operator>=operator<=>

(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(C++20)

compares a sub_match with another sub_match, a string, or a character 
(function template)

operator<<

outputs the matched character subsequence 
(function template)

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <regex>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::string sentence{"Friday the thirteenth."};
const std::regex re{"([A-z]+) ([a-z]+) ([a-z]+)"};
std::smatch words;
std::regex_search(sentence, words, re);
std::cout << std::boolalpha;
for (const auto& m : words)
{
assert(m.matched);
std::cout << "m: [" << m << "], m.length(): " << m.length() << ", "
"*m.first: '" << *m.first << "', "
"*m.second: '" << *m.second << "'\n";
}
}

Output:

m: [Friday the thirteenth], m.length(): 21, *m.first: 'F', *m.second: '.'
m: [Friday], m.length(): 6, *m.first: 'F', *m.second: ' '
m: [the], m.length(): 3, *m.first: 't', *m.second: ' '
m: [thirteenth], m.length(): 10, *m.first: 't', *m.second: '.'
