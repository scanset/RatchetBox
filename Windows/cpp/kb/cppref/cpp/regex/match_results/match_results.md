match_results() : match_results(Allocator()) {}

(1)

explicit match_results( const Allocator& a );

(2)

match_results( const match_results& rhs );

(3)

match_results( const match_results& rhs, const Allocator& a );

(4)

match_results( match_results&& rhs ) noexcept;

(5)

match_results( match_results&& rhs, const Allocator& a );

(6)

1,2) Constructs a match result with no established result state.

1) The default constructor.

2) Constructs the match result using a copy of a as the allocator.

When the construction finishes, ready() returns false and size() returns ​0​.

3-6) Constructs a match result from rhs.

3) The copy constructor.

4) Constructs the match result using a copy of a as the allocator.

5) The move constructor. When the construction finishes, rhs is in a valid but unspecified state.

6) Constructs the match result using a copy of a as the allocator. When the construction finishes, rhs is in a valid but unspecified state.

Given the value of rhs before the construction as m and any integer in [​0​, m.size()) as n, when the construction finishes, the following member functions should return the specified values:

Member function 

Value

ready()

m.ready()

size()

m.size()

str(n)

m.str(n)

prefix()

m.prefix()

suffix()

m.suffix()

operator[](n)

m[n]

length(n)

m.length(n)

position(n)

 m.position(n) 

### Parameters

a

-

allocator to use for all memory allocations of this container

rhs

-

another match_results to use as source to initialize the match_results with

### Exceptions

1-4) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

6) Throws nothing if a == rhs.get_allocator() is true.
