difference_type length( size_type n = 0 ) const;

(since C++11)

Returns the length of the specified sub-match.

If n == 0, the length of the entire matched expression is returned.

If n > 0 && n < size(), the length of nth sub-match is returned.

if n >= size(), a length of the unmatched match is returned.

The call is equivalent to (*this)[n].length().

ready() must be true. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.
