template< class Duration >

static std::chrono::utc_time<std::common_type_t<Duration, std::chrono::seconds>>

to_utc( const std::chrono::gps_time<Duration>& t ) noexcept;

(since C++20)

Converts the gps_time t to a utc_time representing the same point in time.

### Return value

A std::chrono::utc_time representing the same point in time as t, computed as if by constructing a value of the return type from t.time_since_epoch() and adding 315964809s (315964809 is the number of seconds between the epochs of the two clocks: 1980-01-06 00:00:00 UTC for gps_clock and 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC for utc_clock).
