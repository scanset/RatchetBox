template< class Duration >

static std::chrono::utc_time<std::common_type_t<Duration, std::chrono::seconds>>

to_utc( const std::chrono::tai_time<Duration>& t ) noexcept;

(since C++20)

Converts the tai_time t to a utc_time representing the same point in time.

### Return value

A std::chrono::utc_time representing the same point in time as t, computed as if by constructing a value of the return type from t.time_since_epoch() and subtracting 378691210s (378691210 is the number of seconds between the epochs of the two clocks: 1958-01-01 00:00:00 TAI and 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).
