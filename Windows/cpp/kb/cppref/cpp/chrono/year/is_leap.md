constexpr bool is_leap() const noexcept;

(since C++20)

Determines if *this represents a leap year in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.

*this represents a leap year if the stored year value

- is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100; or

- is divisible by 400.

### Return value

true if *this represents a leap year, otherwise false.

### Example

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
using namespace std::chrono_literals;
for (const std::chrono::year y : {2020y, 2021y, 2000y, 3000y})
{
if (const int iy{static_cast<int>(y)}; y.is_leap())
std::cout << iy << " is a leap year because it is divisible by "
<< (iy % 400 == 0 ? "400\n" : "4 and not divisible by 100\n");
else
std::cout << iy << " is not a leap year\n";
}
}

Output:

2020 is a leap year because it is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100
2021 is not a leap year
2000 is a leap year because it is divisible by 400
3000 is not a leap year
