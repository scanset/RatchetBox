template< class CharT, class Traits >

std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&

    operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os,

const std::chrono::month_weekday_last& mwdl );

(since C++20)

Outputs a textual representation of mwdl into os, as if by

os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}/{:L}"),

                  mwdl.month(), mwdl.weekday_last());

where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}/{:L}") is "{:L}/{:L}" if CharT is char, and L"{:L}/{:L}" if CharT is wchar_t.
