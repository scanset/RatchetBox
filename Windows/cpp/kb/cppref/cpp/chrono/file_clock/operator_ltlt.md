std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&

    operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os,

const std::chrono::file_time<Duration>& tp );

(since C++20)

Outputs tp into the stream os, as if by os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY-WIDEN("{:L%F %T}"), tp), where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L%F %T}") is "{:L%F %T}" if CharT is char, and L"{:L%F %T}" if CharT is wchar_t.
