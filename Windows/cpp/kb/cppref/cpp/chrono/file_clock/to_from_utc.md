template< class Duration >

static std::chrono::file_time</* see below */>

from_utc( const std::chrono::utc_time<Duration>& t );

(2)
(since C++20) 
(optional*)

1) Converts the file_time t to a utc_time representing the same point in time.

2) Converts the utc_time t to a file_time representing the same point in time.

The duration of the return type is computed from Duration in an unspecified manner.

These function templates are optional: an implementation may choose to instead provide to_sys() and from_sys().

### Return value

1) A utc_time representing the same point in time as the argument.

2) A file_time representing the same point in time as the argument.

### Notes

User code should usually use std::chrono::clock_cast, which provides a generic interface to convert time points between clocks, rather than call these functions directly.
