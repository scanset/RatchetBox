Defined in header <chrono>

class leap_second;

(since C++20)

The class leap_second represents the date and time of a leap second insertion.

Users cannot construct leap_second objects except by copying from existing leap_second objects. The library implementation creates leap_second objects when it initializes the time zone database and provides const access to these objects.

leap_second has a defaulted copy constructor and a defaulted copy assignment operator.
