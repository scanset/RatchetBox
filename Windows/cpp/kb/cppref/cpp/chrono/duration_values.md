Defined in header <chrono>

template< class Rep >

struct duration_values;

(since C++11)

The std::chrono::duration_values type defines three common durations:

- std::chrono::duration_values::zero

- std::chrono::duration_values::min

- std::chrono::duration_values::max

The zero, min, and max static member functions in std::chrono::duration forward their work to these functions.

This type can be specialized if the representation Rep requires a specific implementation to return these duration objects.

### Member functions

zero

[static]

returns a zero-length representation 
(public static member function)

min

[static]

returns the smallest possible representation 
(public static member function)

max

[static]

returns the largest possible representation 
(public static member function)
