Defined in header <ctime>

double difftime( std::time_t time_end, std::time_t time_beg );

Computes difference between two calendar times as std::time_t objects (time_end - time_beg) in seconds. If time_end refers to time point before time_beg then the result is negative.

### Parameters

time_beg, time_end

-

times to compare

### Return value

Difference between two times in seconds.

### Notes

On POSIX systems, std::time_t is measured in seconds, and difftime is equivalent to arithmetic subtraction, but C and C++ allow fractional units for time_t.

### Example

Run this code

#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::time_t start = std::time(nullptr);
volatile double d = 1.0;
 
// some time-consuming operation
for (int p = 0; p < 10000; ++p)
for (int q = 0; q < 100000; ++q)
d = d + p * d * q + d;
 
std::cout << "Wall time passed: "
<< std::difftime(std::time(nullptr), start) << " s.\n";
}

Possible output:

Wall time passed: 9 s.
