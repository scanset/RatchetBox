std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&

    operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os,

const std::chrono::year_month_weekday_last& ymwdl );

(since C++20)

Outputs a textual representation of ymwdl into os, as if by

os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{}/{:L}/{:L}"),

                  ymwdl.year(), ymwdl.month(), ymwdl.weekday_last());

where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{}/{:L}/{:L}") is "{}/{:L}/{:L}" if CharT is char, and L"..." if CharT is wchar_t.
