template< class CharT, class Traits >

std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&

    operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os,

const std::chrono::year_month_weekday& ymwd );

(since C++20)

Outputs a textual representation of ymwd into os, as if by

os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{}/{:L}/{:L}"),

                  ymwd.year(), ymwd.month(), ymwd.weekday_indexed());

where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{}/{:L}/{:L}") is "{}/{:L}/{:L}" if CharT is char, and L"{}/{:L}/{:L}" if CharT is wchar_t.
