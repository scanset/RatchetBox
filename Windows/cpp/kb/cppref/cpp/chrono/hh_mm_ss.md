Defined in header <chrono>

template< class Duration >

class hh_mm_ss;

(since C++20)

The class template hh_mm_ss splits a std::chrono::duration into a "broken down" time such as hours:minutes:seconds, with the precision of the split determined by the Duration template parameter. It is primarily a formatting tool.

Duration must be a specialization of std::chrono::duration, otherwise the program is ill-formed.

### Member constants

constexpr unsigned fractional_width

[static]

the smallest possible integer in the range [​0​, 18] such that precision (see below) will exactly represent the value of Duration{1}, or 6 if there's no such integer 
(public static member constant)

### Member types

Member type

Definition

precision

std::chrono::duration<std::common_type_t<Duration::rep, std::chrono::seconds::rep>,
                      std::ratio<1, 10fractional_width>>

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a hh_mm_ss 
(public member function)

is_negativehoursminutessecondssubseconds

obtains components of the broken-down time 
(public member function)

operator precisionto_duration

obtains the stored std::chrono::duration 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator<<

(C++20)

outputs a hh_mm_ss into a stream 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::formatter<std::chrono::hh_mm_ss>

(C++20)

formatting support for hh_mm_ss 
(class template specialization)
