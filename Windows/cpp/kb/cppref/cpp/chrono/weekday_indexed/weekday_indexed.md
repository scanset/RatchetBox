weekday_indexed() = default;

(1)
(since C++20)

constexpr weekday_indexed( const std::chrono::weekday& wd, unsigned index ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++20)

Constructs a weekday_indexed.

1) Default constructor leaves both the std::chrono::weekday and the index value uninitialized.

2) Constructs a weekday_indexed storing the weekday wd and the index index. The values held are unspecified if !wd.ok() | index > 7.

### Notes

A more convenient way to construct a weekday_indexed is with weekday's operator[], i.e., wd[index].

### Example

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std::chrono;
 
int main()
{
constexpr auto third_friday = weekday_indexed(Friday, 3); // uses constructor (2)
static_assert(third_friday == Friday[3]);
 
weekday_indexed wdi = Tuesday[2]; // represents the 2nd Tuesday
std::cout << year_month_day{ wdi / October / 2019y } << '\n';
}

Possible output:

2019-10-08
