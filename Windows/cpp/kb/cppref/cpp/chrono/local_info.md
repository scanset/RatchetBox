Defined in header <chrono>

struct local_info;

(since C++20)

The class local_info describes the result of converting a std::chrono::local_time to a std::chrono::sys_time.

- If the result of the conversion is unique, then result == local_info::unique, first is filled out with the correct std::chrono::sys_info, and second is zero-initialized.

- If the local_time is nonexistent, then result == local_info::nonexistent, first is filled out with the std::chrono::sys_info that ends just prior to the local_time, and second is filled out with the std::chrono::sys_info that begins just after the local_time.

- If the local_time is ambiguous, then result == local_info::ambiguous, first is filled out with the std::chrono::sys_info that ends just after the local_time, and second is filled with the std::chrono::sys_info that starts just before the local_time.

This is a low-level data structure; typical conversions from local_time to sys_time will use it implicitly rather than explicitly.
