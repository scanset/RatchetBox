    class Clock,

    class Duration = typename Clock::duration

> class time_point;

(since C++11)

Class template std::chrono::time_point represents a point in time. It is implemented as if it stores a value of type Duration indicating the time interval from the start of the Clock's epoch.

Clock must meet the requirements for Clock or be std::chrono::local_t(since C++20).

(until C++23)

### Member types

Member type

Definition

clock

Clock, the clock on which this time point is measured

duration

Duration, a std::chrono::duration type used to measure the time since epoch

rep

Rep, an arithmetic type representing the number of ticks of the duration

period

Period, a std::ratio type representing the tick period of the duration

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new time point 
(public member function)

time_since_epoch

returns the time point as duration since the start of its clock 
(public member function)

operator+=operator-=

modifies the time point by the given duration 
(public member function)

operator++operator++(int)operator--operator--(int)

(C++20)

increments or decrements the duration 
(public member function)

min

[static]

returns the time point corresponding to the smallest duration 
(public static member function)

max

[static]

returns the time point corresponding to the largest duration 
(public static member function)

### Non-member functions

operator+operator-

(C++11)

performs add and subtract operations involving a time point 
(function template)

operator==operator!=operator<operator<=operator>operator>=operator<=>

(C++11)(C++11)(removed in C++20)(C++11)(C++11)(C++11)(C++11)(C++20)

compares two time points 
(function template)

time_point_cast

(C++11)

converts a time point to another time point on the same clock, with a different duration 
(function template)

floor(std::chrono::time_point)

(C++17)

converts a time_point to another, rounding down 
(function template)

ceil(std::chrono::time_point)

(C++17)

converts a time_point to another, rounding up 
(function template)

round(std::chrono::time_point)

(C++17)

converts a time_point to another, rounding to nearest, ties to even 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::common_type<std::chrono::time_point>

(C++11)

specializes the std::common_type trait 
(class template specialization)

std::hash<std::chrono::time_point>

(C++26)

hash support for std::chrono::time_point 
(class template specialization)

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <chrono>
#include <ctime>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
 
void slow_motion()
{
static int a[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12};
// Generate Γ(13) == 12! permutations:
while (std::ranges::next_permutation(a).found) {}
}
 
int main()
{
using namespace std::literals; // enables literal suffixes, e.g. 24h, 1ms, 1s.
 
const std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::system_clock> now =
std::chrono::system_clock::now();
 
const std::time_t t_c = std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t(now - 24h);
std::cout << "24 hours ago, the time was "
<< std::put_time(std::localtime(&t_c), "%F %T.\n") << std::flush;
 
const std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::steady_clock> start =
std::chrono::steady_clock::now();
 
std::cout << "Different clocks are not comparable: \n"
" System time: " << now.time_since_epoch() << "\n"
" Steady time: " << start.time_since_epoch() << '\n';
 
slow_motion();
 
const auto end = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();
std::cout
<< "Slow calculations took "
<< std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end - start) << " ≈ "
<< (end - start) / 1ms << "ms ≈ " // almost equivalent form of the above, but
<< (end - start) / 1s << "s.\n"; // using milliseconds and seconds accordingly
}

Possible output:

24 hours ago, the time was 2021-02-15 18:28:52.
Different clocks are not comparable:
System time: 1666497022681282572ns
Steady time: 413668317434475ns
Slow calculations took 2090448µs ≈ 2090ms ≈ 2s.
