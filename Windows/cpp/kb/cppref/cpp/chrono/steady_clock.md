Defined in header <chrono>

class steady_clock;

(since C++11)

Class std::chrono::steady_clock represents a monotonic clock. The time points of this clock cannot decrease as physical time moves forward and the time between ticks of this clock is constant. This clock is not related to wall clock time (for example, it can be time since last reboot), and is most suitable for measuring intervals.

std::chrono::steady_clock meets the requirements of TrivialClock. 

### Member types

Member type

Definition

rep

arithmetic type representing the number of ticks in the clock's duration

period

a std::ratio type representing the tick period of the clock, in seconds

duration

std::chrono::duration<rep, period>

time_point

std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::steady_clock>

### Member constants

constexpr bool is_steady

[static]

steady clock flag, always true 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions
