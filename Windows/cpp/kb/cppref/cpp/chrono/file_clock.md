Defined in header <chrono>

using file_clock = /* see below */;

(since C++20)

std::chrono::file_clock is an alias for the clock used for std::filesystem::file_time_type. Its epoch is unspecified.

file_clock meets the TrivialClock requirements.

(since C++20)

operator<<(std::chrono::file_time)

(C++20)

performs stream output on a file_time 
(function template)

from_stream(std::chrono::file_time)

(C++20)

parses a file_time from a stream according to the provided format 
(function template)

std::formatter<std::chrono::file_time>

(C++20)

### Member types

Member type

Definition

rep

signed arithmetic type representing the number of ticks in the clock's duration

period

a std::ratio type representing the tick period of the clock, in seconds

duration

std::chrono::duration<rep, period>, capable of representing negative durations

time_point

std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::file_clock>

### Member constants

constexpr bool is_steady

[static]

true if the time between ticks is always constant, i.e. calls to now() return values that increase monotonically even in case of some external clock adjustment, otherwise false 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

file_clock provides exactly one of the following two pairs of static member functions:

- to_utc and from_utc; or

- to_sys and from_sys.

now

[static]

returns a std::chrono::time_point representing the current point in time 
(public static member function)

to_utcfrom_utc

[static] (optional)

converts between file_time and utc_time 
(public static member function)

to_sysfrom_sys

[static] (optional)

converts between file_time and sys_time 
(public static member function)
