(since C++20)

last_spec is an empty tag type that is used in conjunction with other calendar types to indicate the last thing in a sequence. Depending on context, it may indicate the last day of a month (as in 2018y/February/last, for last day of February 2018, i.e., 2018-02-28) or the last day of the week in a month (as in 2018/February/Sunday[last], for last Sunday of February 2018, i.e., 2018-02-25).

### Example

Run this code

#include <chrono>
 
int main()
{
using namespace std::chrono;
 
constexpr auto mdl {June/last};
static_assert(mdl == month_day_last(month(6)));
 
constexpr auto ymwdl {year(2023)/December/Tuesday[last]};
static_assert(ymwdl ==
year_month_weekday_last(year(2023), month(12), weekday_last(Tuesday)));
}
