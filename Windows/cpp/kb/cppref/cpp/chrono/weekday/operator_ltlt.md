Defined in header <chrono>

template< class CharT, class Traits >

std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&

operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os, const std::chrono::weekday& wd );

(since C++20)

If !wd.ok(), inserts wd.c_encoding() followed by " is not a valid weekday" into os. Otherwise, forms a std::basic_string<CharT> s consisting of the abbreviated weekday name for the weekday represented by wd, determined using the locale associated with os, and inserts s into os.

Equivalent to

return os << (wd.ok() ?

    std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L%a}"), wd) :

    std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{} is not a valid weekday"),

                wd.c_encoding()));

where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("...") is "..." if CharT is char, and L"..." if CharT is wchar_t.
