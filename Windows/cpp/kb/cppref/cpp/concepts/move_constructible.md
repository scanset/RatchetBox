Defined in header <concepts>

template< class T >

concept move_constructible = std::constructible_from<T, T> && std::convertible_to<T, T>;

(since C++20)

The concept move_constructible is satisfied if T is a reference type, or if it is an object type where an object of that type can be constructed from an rvalue of that type in both direct- and copy-initialization contexts, with the usual semantics.

### Semantic requirements

If T is an object type, then move_constructible<T> is modeled only if given

- rv, an rvalue of type T, and

- u2, a distinct object of type T equal to rv,

the following are true:

- After the definition T u = rv;, u is equal to u2;

- T(rv) is equal to u2; and

- If T is not const-qualified, then rv's resulting state (after the definition/expression is evaluated in either bullets above) is valid but unspecified; otherwise, it is unchanged.
