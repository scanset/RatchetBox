Defined in header <concepts>

template< class R, class T, class U >

concept equivalence_relation = std::relation<R, T, U>;

(since C++20)

The concept equivalence_relation<R, T, U> specifies that the relation R imposes an equivalence relation on its arguments.

### Semantic requirements

A relation r is an equivalence relation if

- it is reflexive: for all x, r(x, x) is true;

- it is symmetric: for all a and b, r(a, b) is true if and only if r(b, a) is true;

- it is transitive: r(a, b) && r(b, c) implies r(a, c).

### Notes

The distinction between relation and equivalence_relation is purely semantic.
