Defined in header <concepts>

template< class T >

concept destructible = std::is_nothrow_destructible_v<T>;

(since C++20)

The concept destructible specifies the concept of all types whose instances can safely be destroyed at the end of their lifetime (including reference types).

### Notes

Unlike the Destructible named requirement, std::destructible requires the destructor to be noexcept(true), not merely non-throwing when invoked, and allows reference types and array types.
