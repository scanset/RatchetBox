C++ includes support for two types of time manipulation:

- The chrono library, a flexible collection of types that track time with varying degrees of precision (e.g. std::chrono::time_point).

- C-style date and time library (e.g. std::time).

### Chrono library (since C++11)

The chrono library defines three(until C++20)five(since C++20) main types as well as utility functions and common typedefs:

- clocks

- time points

- durations

- calendar dates

- time zone information

(since C++20)

#### Clocks

A clock consists of a starting point (or epoch) and a tick rate. For example, a clock may have an epoch of January 1, 1970 and tick every second. C++ defines several clock types:

Defined in header <chrono> 

Defined in namespace std::chrono 

system_clock

(C++11)

wall clock time from the system-wide realtime clock 
(class)

steady_clock

(C++11)

monotonic clock that will never be adjusted 
(class)

high_resolution_clock

(C++11)

the clock with the shortest tick period available 
(class)

is_clockis_clock_v

(C++20)

determines if a type is a Clock
(class template) (variable template)

utc_clock

(C++20)

Clock for Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) 
(class)

A time point is a duration of time that has passed since the epoch of a specific clock.

#### Duration

A duration consists of a span of time, defined as some number of ticks of some time unit. For example, "42 seconds" could be represented by a duration consisting of 42 ticks of a 1-second time unit.

### C-style date and time library

Also provided are the C-style date and time functions, such as std::time_t, std::difftime, and CLOCKS_PER_SEC.

### Example

Measures and displays an execution time of a function call.

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
 
long Fibonacci(unsigned n)
{
return n < 2 ? n : Fibonacci(n - 1) + Fibonacci(n - 2);
}
 
int main()
{
const auto start{std::chrono::steady_clock::now()};
const auto fb{Fibonacci(42)};
const auto end{std::chrono::steady_clock::now()};
const std::chrono::duration<double> elapsed_seconds{end - start};
 
std::cout << "Fibonacci(42): " << fb << "\nElapsed time: ";
// std::cout << elapsed_seconds.count() << "s\n"; // Before C++20
std::cout << elapsed_seconds << '\n'; // C++20's chrono::duration operator<<
}

Possible output:

Fibonacci(42): 267914296
Elapsed time: 0.791429s
