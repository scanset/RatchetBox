The Execution library provides a framework for managing asynchronous execution on generic execution resources.

The library aims to provide vocabulary types for asynchronous operations and to allow the construction of task execution graphs in a simple, composable way.

## Library-wide definitions

- Sender: A description of asynchronous work to be sent for execution. Produces an operation state (below).

- Senders asynchronously “send” their results to listeners called “receivers” (below).

- Senders can be composed into task graphs using generic algorithms.

- Sender factories and adaptors are generic algorithms that capture common async patterns in objects satisfying the sender concept.

- Receiver: A generalized callback that consumes or “receives” the asynchronous results produced by a sender.

- Receivers have three different “channels” through which a sender may propagate results: success, failure, and canceled, so-named “value”, “error”, and “stopped”.

- Receivers provide an extensible execution environment: a set of key/value pairs that the consumer can use to parameterize the asynchronous operation.

- Operation State: An object that contains the state needed by the asynchronous operation. 

- A sender and receiver are connected when passed to the std::execution::connect function.

- The result of connecting a sender and a receiver is an operation state. 

- Work is not enqueued for execution until “start” is called on an operation state.

- Once started, the operation state’s lifetime cannot end before the async operation is complete, and its address must be stable.

- Scheduler: A lightweight handle to an execution context. 

- An execution context is a source of asynchronous execution such as a thread pool or a GPU stream. 

- A scheduler is a factory for a sender that completes its receiver from a thread of execution owned by the execution context.

The following are sender factories:

Defined in header <execution> 

Defined in namespace std::execution 

execution::just

Accepts a single argument and returns a sender that, when connected and started, completes synchronously by passing the argument to the receiver's error completion function
(customization point object)

execution::just_stopped

#### Sender adaptors

A sender adaptor is a function returning a sender whose parameters include at least one whose type satisfies the sender concept, and for which the returned sender is a parent sender of the adaptor function's sender arguments.

The following are sender adaptors:

Defined in header <execution> 

Defined in namespace std::execution 

execution::starts_on

adapts a provided sender into one that completes on the provided scheduler's execution resource
(customization point object)

execution::on

adapts a provided sender to transfer execution to a provided scheduler's execution resource on which the sender or the continuation runs, and then transfers execution back to the original resource
(customization point object)

execution::schedule_from

(C++26)

schedules work dependent on the completion of a provided sender onto a provided scheduler's execution resource
(customization point object)

execution::then

(C++26)

chains the task graph by the input sender with a node represents invoking the provided function with the values sent by the input sender as arguments
(customization point object)

execution::upon_error

(C++26)

chains the task graph by the input sender with a node representing invoking the provided function with the error sent by the input sender if an error occurred
(customization point object)

(C++26)

chains the task graph by the input sender with a node representing invoking the provided function with the stopped behavior by the input sender if a "stopped" signal is sent
(customization point object)

execution::let_value

(C++26)

returns a sender which represents a node chained to the input sender, which when started, invokes the provided function with the values sent by the input sender as arguments
(customization point object)

execution::let_error

(C++26)

returns a sender which represents a node chained to the input sender, which invokes the provided function with the error from the input sender, if occurred

(customization point object)

execution::bulk

(C++26)

creates a multi-shot sender that invokes the function with every index in the provided shape along with the values sent by the input sender. The sender completes once all invocations have completed, or an error has occurred
(customization point object)

execution::split

(C++26)

if the provided sender is a multi-shot sender, returns that sender, otherwise, returns a multi-shot sender which sends values equivalent to the values sent by the provided sender
(customization point object)

execution::when_all

adapts multiple input senders into a sender that completes once all of the input senders have completed
(customization point object)

A sender consumer is an algorithm that takes one or more senders as parameters and that does not return a sender.

Defined in header <execution> 

Defined in namespace std::this_thread 

this_thread::sync_wait

(C++26)

blocks current thread until the specified sender completes and returns its async result
(customization point object)

this_thread::sync_wait_with_variant

(C++26)

blocks current thread until the specified sender with possibly multiple completion signatures completes and returns its async result
(customization point object)

### Example

A version of this example is available on godbolt.org, where it uses stdexec, an experimental reference implementation of std::execution.

Run this code

#include <cstdio>
#include <execution>
#include <string>
#include <thread>
#include <utility>
using namespace std::literals;
 
int main()
{
std::execution::run_loop loop;
 
std::jthread worker([&](std::stop_token st)
{
std::stop_callback cb{st, [&]{ loop.finish(); }};
loop.run();
});
 
std::execution::sender auto hello = std::execution::just("hello world"s);
std::execution::sender auto print
= std::move(hello)
std::execution::then([](std::string msg)
{
return std::puts(msg.c_str());
});
 
std::execution::scheduler auto io_thread = loop.get_scheduler();
std::execution::sender auto work = std::execution::on(io_thread, std::move(print));
 
auto [result] = std::this_thread::sync_wait(std::move(work)).value();
 
return result;
}

Output:

hello world
