Defined in header <stdexcept>

class underflow_error;

Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It may be used to report arithmetic underflow errors (that is, situations where the result of a computation is a subnormal floating-point value).

The standard library components do not throw this exception (mathematical functions report underflow errors as specified in math_errhandling). Third-party libraries, however, use this. For example, boost.math throws std::underflow_error if boost::math::policies::throw_on_error is enabled (the default setting).

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new underflow_error object with the given message 
(public member function)

operator=

replaces the underflow_error object 
(public member function)

## std::underflow_error::underflow_error

underflow_error( const std::string& what_arg );

(1)

underflow_error( const char* what_arg );

(2)

underflow_error( const underflow_error& other );

(3)
(noexcept since C++11)

1) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg.c_str()) == 0.

2) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg) == 0.

3) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::underflow_error then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0. No exception can be thrown from the copy constructor.

### Parameters

what_arg

-

explanatory string

other

-

another exception object to copy

### Exceptions

1,2) May throw std::bad_alloc.

### Notes

Because copying std::underflow_error is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string. This is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&&: it would have to copy the content anyway.

Before the resolution of LWG issue 254, the non-copy constructor can only accept std::string. It makes dynamic allocation mandatory in order to construct a std::string object.

After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy constructor. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.

## std::underflow_error::operator=

underflow_error& operator=( const underflow_error& other );

(noexcept since C++11)

Assigns the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::underflow_error then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment. No exception can be thrown from the copy assignment operator.

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to assign with

### Return value

*this

### Notes

After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy assignment operator. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.
