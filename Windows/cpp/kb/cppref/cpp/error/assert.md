Defined in header <cassert>

Disabled assertion

(1)

#define assert(condition) ((void)0)

(until C++26)

#define assert(...)       ((void)0)

(since C++26)

Enabled assertion

(2)

#define assert(condition) /* unspecified */

(until C++26)

#define assert(...)       /* unspecified */

(since C++26)

The definition of the macro assert depends on another macro, NDEBUG, which is not defined by the standard library.

1) If NDEBUG is defined as a macro name at the point in the source code where <cassert> or <assert.h> is included, the assertion is disabled: assert does nothing.

2) Otherwise, the assertion is enabled:

assert checks if its argument (which must have scalar type):

- If the argument compares unequal to zero, there are no further effects.

- Otherwise, assert creates a diagnostic on the standard error stream and calls std::abort().

(until C++26)

assert puts a diagnostic test into programs and expands to an expression of type void. __VA_ARGS__ is evaluated and contextually converted to bool:

- If the evaluation yields true, there are no further effects.

- Otherwise, assert creates a diagnostic on the standard error stream and calls std::abort().

(since C++26)

The diagnostic information has an implementation-defined format, but it always includes the following information:

- the text of condition

(until C++26)

- #__VA_ARGS__

(since C++26)

- the source file name (i.e., __FILE__)

- the source line number (i.e., __LINE__)

- the name of the enclosing function (i.e., __func__)

The expression assert(E) is guaranteed to be a constant subexpression, if either

- NDEBUG is defined at the point where assert is last defined or redefined, or

- E, contextually converted to bool, is a constant subexpression that evaluates to true.

(since C++11)

### Parameters

condition

-

expression of scalar type

### Notes

Because assert is a function-like macro, commas anywhere in the argument that are not protected by parentheses are interpreted as macro argument separators. Such commas are often found in template argument lists and list-initialization:

assert(std::is_same_v<int, int>); // error: assert does not take two arguments
assert((std::is_same_v<int, int>)); // OK: one argument
static_assert(std::is_same_v<int, int>); // OK: not a macro
 
std::complex<double> c;
assert(c == std::complex<double>{0, 0}); // error
assert((c == std::complex<double>{0, 0})); // OK

(until C++26)

There is no standardized interface to add an additional message to assert errors. A portable way to include one is to use a comma operator provided it has not been overloaded, or use && with a string literal:

assert(("There are five lights", 2 + 2 == 5));
assert(2 + 2 == 5 && "There are five lights");

The implementation of assert in Microsoft CRT does not conform to C++11 and later revisions, because its underlying function (_wassert) takes neither __func__ nor an equivalent replacement.

Since C++20, the values needed for the diagnostic message can also be obtained from std::source_location::current().

Even though the change of assert in C23/C++26 is not formally a defect report, the C committee recommends implementations to backport the change to old modes.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
// uncomment to disable assert()
// #define NDEBUG
#include <cassert>
 
// Use (void) to silence unused warnings.
#define assertm(exp, msg) assert((void(msg), exp))
 
int main()
{
assert(2 + 2 == 4);
std::cout << "Checkpoint #1\n";
 
assert((void("void helps to avoid 'unused value' warning"), 2 * 2 == 4));
std::cout << "Checkpoint #2\n";
 
assert((010 + 010 == 16) && "Yet another way to add an assert message");
std::cout << "Checkpoint #3\n";
 
assertm((2 + 2) % 3 == 1, "Success");
std::cout << "Checkpoint #4\n";
 
assertm(2 + 2 == 5, "Failed"); // assertion fails
std::cout << "Execution continues past the last assert\n"; // No output
}

Possible output:

Checkpoint #1
Checkpoint #2
Checkpoint #3
Checkpoint #4
main.cpp:23: int main(): Assertion `((void)"Failed", 2 + 2 == 5)' failed.
Aborted
