Defined in header <system_error>

template< class T >

struct is_error_condition_enum;

(since C++11)

If T is an error condition enum (such as std::errc), this template provides the member constant value equal true. For any other type, value is false.

This template may be specialized for a program-defined type to indicate that the type is eligible for std::error_condition implicit conversions.

### Helper variable template

template< class T >

inline constexpr bool is_error_condition_enum_v =

is_error_condition_enum<T>::value;

(since C++17)

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

true if T is an error condition enum, false otherwise 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator bool

converts the object to bool, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)

### Member types
