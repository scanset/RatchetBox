template< class ErrorConditionEnum >

error_condition& operator=( ErrorConditionEnum e ) noexcept;

(1)
(since C++11)

error_condition& operator=( const error_condition& other ) = default;

(2)
(since C++11) 
(implicitly declared)

error_condition& operator=( error_condition&& other ) = default;

(3)
(since C++11) 
(implicitly declared)

Assigns contents to an error condition.

1) Assigns error condition for enum e. Effectively calls make_error_condition that is only found by argument-dependent lookup for e and then replaces *this with the result. This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_error_condition_enum<ErrorConditionEnum>::value is true.

2,3) Implicitly defined copy-assignment operator and move-assignment operator assign the contents of other to *this.

### Parameters

e

-

error condition enum

other

-

another error condition to assign with

### Return value
