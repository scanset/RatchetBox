explicit operator bool() const noexcept;

(since C++11)

Checks if the error code value is valid, i.e. non-zero.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

false if value() == 0, true otherwise.

### Notes

Although this operator is often used as a convenient shorthand to check if any error was returned, as in if (ec) { /* handle error */ }, such use is not robust: some error codes, for example, HTTP status code 200, may indicate success as well.
