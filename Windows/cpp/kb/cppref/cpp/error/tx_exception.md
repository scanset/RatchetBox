class tx_exception : public std::runtime_error;

(TM TS)

Defines an exception type that can be used to cancel and roll back an atomic transaction initiated by the keyword atomic_cancel.

If T is not TriviallyCopyable, the program that specializes std::tx_exception<T> is ill-formed.

### Member functions

## std::tx_exception::tx_exception

explicit tx_exception( T value ) transaction_safe;

(1)
(TM TS)

tx_exception( T value, const std::string& what_arg ) transaction_safe;

(2)
(TM TS)

tx_exception( T value, const char* what_arg ) transaction_safe;

(3)
(TM TS)

tx_exception( const tx_exception& other ) transaction_safe noexcept;

(4)
(TM TS)

1-3) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string that can be accessed through what() and value as the object that can be accessed through get().

4) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::tx_exception<T> then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0.

### Parameters

value

-

payload object

what_arg

-

explanatory string

other

-

another exception object to copy

### Exceptions

1-3) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

## std::tx_exception::operator=

tx_exception& operator=( const tx_exception& other ) transaction_safe noexcept;

(TM TS)

Assigns the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::tx_exception<T> then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment.

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to assign with

### Return value

*this

## std::tx_exception::get

T get() const transaction_safe;

(TM TS)

Returns the payload object held by the exception object.

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

## std::tx_exception::what

virtual const char* what() const transaction_safe_dynamic noexcept;

(TM TS)

Returns the explanatory string.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Pointer to a null-terminated string with explanatory information.
