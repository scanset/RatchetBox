Defined in header <stdexcept>

class invalid_argument;

Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It reports errors that arise because an argument value has not been accepted.

This exception is thrown by std::bitset::bitset, and the std::stoi and std::stof families of functions.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new invalid_argument object with the given message 
(public member function)

operator=

replaces the invalid_argument object 
(public member function)

## std::invalid_argument::invalid_argument

invalid_argument( const std::string& what_arg );

(1)

invalid_argument( const char* what_arg );

(2)

invalid_argument( const invalid_argument& other );

(3)
(noexcept since C++11)

1) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg.c_str()) == 0.

2) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg) == 0.

3) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::invalid_argument then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0. No exception can be thrown from the copy constructor.

### Parameters

what_arg

-

explanatory string

other

-

another exception object to copy

### Exceptions

1,2) May throw std::bad_alloc.

### Notes

Because copying std::invalid_argument is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string. This is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&&: it would have to copy the content anyway.

Before the resolution of LWG issue 254, the non-copy constructor can only accept std::string. It makes dynamic allocation mandatory in order to construct a std::string object.

After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy constructor. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.

## std::invalid_argument::operator=

invalid_argument& operator=( const invalid_argument& other );

(noexcept since C++11)

Assigns the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::invalid_argument then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment. No exception can be thrown from the copy assignment operator.

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to assign with

### Return value

*this

### Notes

After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy assignment operator. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.

### Member functions

(destructor)

[virtual]

destroys the exception object 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

### Notes

The purpose of this exception type is similar to the error condition std::errc::invalid_argument (thrown in std::system_error from member functions of std::thread) and the related errno constant EINVAL.

### Example

Run this code

#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
try
{
std::bitset<4>{"012"}; // Throws: only '0' or '1' expected
}
catch (std::invalid_argument const& ex)
{
std::cout << "#1: " << ex.what() << '\n';
}
 
try
{
[[maybe_unused]] int f = std::stoi("ABBA"); // Throws: no conversion
}
catch (std::invalid_argument const& ex)
{
std::cout << "#2: " << ex.what() << '\n';
}
 
try
{
[[maybe_unused]] float f = std::stof("(3.14)"); // Throws: no conversion
}
catch (std::invalid_argument const& ex)
{
std::cout << "#3: " << ex.what() << '\n';
}
}

Possible output:

#1: bitset string ctor has invalid argument
#2: stoi: no conversion
#3: stof: no conversion
