Defined in header <stdexcept>

class length_error;

Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It reports errors that result from attempts to exceed implementation defined length limits for some object.

This exception is thrown by member functions of std::basic_string and std::vector::reserve.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new length_error object with the given message 
(public member function)

operator=

replaces the length_error object 
(public member function)

## std::length_error::length_error

length_error( const std::string& what_arg );

(1)

length_error( const char* what_arg );

(2)

length_error( const length_error& other );

(3)
(noexcept since C++11)

1) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg.c_str()) == 0.

2) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg) == 0.

3) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::length_error then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0. No exception can be thrown from the copy constructor.

### Parameters

what_arg

-

explanatory string

other

-

another exception object to copy

### Exceptions

1,2) May throw std::bad_alloc.

### Notes

Because copying std::length_error is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string. This is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&&: it would have to copy the content anyway.

Before the resolution of LWG issue 254, the non-copy constructor can only accept std::string. It makes dynamic allocation mandatory in order to construct a std::string object.

After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy constructor. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.

## std::length_error::operator=

length_error& operator=( const length_error& other );

(noexcept since C++11)

Assigns the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::length_error then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment. No exception can be thrown from the copy assignment operator.

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to assign with

### Return value

*this

### Notes

After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy assignment operator. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.
