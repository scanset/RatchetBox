Defined in header <exception>

class bad_exception;

std::bad_exception is the type of the exception thrown by the C++ runtime in the following situations:

- If std::exception_ptr stores a copy of the caught exception and if the copy constructor of the exception object caught by std::current_exception throws an exception, the captured exception is an instance of std::bad_exception.

(since C++11)

- If a dynamic exception specification is violated and std::unexpected throws or rethrows an exception that still violates the exception specification, but the exception specification allows std::bad_exception, std::bad_exception is thrown.

(until C++17)

### Example

Compiles only in C++14 or earlier modes (may issue warnings).

Run this code

#include <exception>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
 
void my_unexp()
{
throw;
}
 
void test()
throw(std::bad_exception) // Dynamic exception specifications
// are deprecated in C++11
{
throw std::runtime_error("test");
}
 
int main()
{
std::set_unexpected(my_unexp); // Deprecated in C++11, removed in C++17
 
try
{
test();
}
catch (const std::bad_exception& e)
{
std::cerr << "Caught " << e.what() << '\n';
}
}

Possible output:

Caught std::bad_exception
