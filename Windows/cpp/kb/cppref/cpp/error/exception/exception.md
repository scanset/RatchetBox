Constructs new exception object.

1) Default constructor. what() returns an implementation-defined string.

2) Copy constructor. Initializes the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::exception then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0.

### Parameters

other

-

another exception to assign the contents of

### Notes

Because copying std::exception is not permitted to throw exceptions, when derived classes (such as std::runtime_error) have to manage a user-defined diagnostic message, it is typically implemented as a copy-on-write string.

The Microsoft implementation includes non-standard constructors taking strings thus allowing instances to be thrown directly with a meaningful error message. The nearest standard equivalents are std::runtime_error or std::logic_error.
