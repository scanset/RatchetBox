Defined in header <string>

template< class CharT, class Traits, class Alloc >

void swap( std::basic_string<CharT, Traits, Alloc>& lhs,

std::basic_string<CharT, Traits, Alloc>& rhs );

(until C++17)

template< class CharT, class Traits, class Alloc >

void swap( std::basic_string<CharT, Traits, Alloc>& lhs,

std::basic_string<CharT, Traits, Alloc>& rhs ) noexcept(/* see below */);

(since C++17) 
(constexpr since C++20)

Specializes the std::swap algorithm for std::basic_string. Swaps the contents of lhs and rhs.

Equivalent to lhs.swap(rhs).

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

strings whose contents to swap

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

noexcept specification:  
noexcept(noexcept(lhs.swap(rhs)))

(since C++17)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::string a = "AAA";
std::string b = "BBBB";
 
std::cout << "Before swap:\n"
"a = " << a << "\n"
"b = " << b << "\n\n";
 
std::swap(a, b);
 
std::cout << "After swap:\n"
"a = " << a << "\n"
"b = " << b << '\n';
}

Output:

Before swap:
a = AAA
b = BBBB
 
After swap:
a = BBBB
b = AAA
