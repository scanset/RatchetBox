void swap( basic_string& other );

(until C++17)

void swap( basic_string& other ) noexcept(/* see below */);

(since C++17) 
(constexpr since C++20)

Exchanges the contents of the string with those of other. All iterators and references may be invalidated.

If std::allocator_traits<Allocator>::
    propagate_on_container_swap::value &&
get_allocator() == s.get_allocator() is false, the behavior is undefined.

(since C++11)

### Parameters

other

-

string to exchange the contents with

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

No exception is thrown.

(until C++11)

No exception is thrown, unless the behavior is undefined.

If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

(since C++11)

noexcept specification:  
noexcept(std::allocator_traits<Allocator>::propagate_on_container_swap::value

         std::allocator_traits<Allocator>::is_always_equal::value)

(since C++17)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main() 
{
std::string a = "AAA";
std::string b = "BBBB";
 
std::cout << "Before swap:\n"
"a = " << a << "\n"
"b = " << b << "\n\n";
 
a.swap(b);
 
std::cout << "After swap:\n"
"a = " << a << "\n"
"b = " << b << '\n';
}

Output:

Before swap:
a = AAA
b = BBBB
 
After swap:
a = BBBB
b = AAA

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

DR

Applied to

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

LWG 403

C++98

swap() might throw an exception

no exception is thrown

LWG 535

C++98

swapping strings did not preserve the character orders

orders are also preserved

LWG 2151
(P1148R0)

C++11

no exception was thrown in the case
of unequal non-propagating allocators

the behavior is
undefined in this case
