CharT& at( size_type pos );

(1)
(constexpr since C++20)

const CharT& at( size_type pos ) const;

(2)
(constexpr since C++20)

Returns a reference to the character at specified location pos. Bounds checking is performed, exception of type std::out_of_range will be thrown on invalid access.

### Parameters

pos

-

position of the character to return

### Return value

Reference to the requested character.

### Exceptions

Throws std::out_of_range if pos >= size().

If an exception is thrown for any reason, these functions have no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::string s("message"); // for capacity
 
s = "abc";
s.at(2) = 'x'; // OK
std::cout << s << '\n';
 
std::cout << "string size = " << s.size() << '\n';
std::cout << "string capacity = " << s.capacity() << '\n';
 
try
{
// This will throw since the requested offset is greater than the current size.
s.at(3) = 'x';
}
catch (std::out_of_range const& exc)
{
std::cout << exc.what() << '\n';
}
}

Possible output:

abx
string size = 3
string capacity = 7
basic_string::at

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

DR

Applied to

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

LWG 847

C++98

there was no exception safety guarantee

added strong exception safety guarantee

LWG 2207

C++98

the behavior was undefined if pos >= size() is true

always throws an exception in this case
