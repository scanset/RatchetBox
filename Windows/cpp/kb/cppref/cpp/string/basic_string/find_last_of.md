Finds the last character equal to one of characters in the given character sequence. The exact search algorithm is not specified. The search considers only the range [​0​, pos]. If none of the characters in the given character sequence is present in the range, npos will be returned.

1) Finds the last character equal to one of characters in str.

2) Finds the last character equal to one of characters in range [s, s + count). This range can include null characters.

If [s, s + count) is not a valid range, the behavior is undefined.

3) Finds the last character equal to one of characters in character string pointed to by s. The length of the string is determined by the first null character using Traits::length(s).

If [s, s + Traits::length(s)) is not a valid range, the behavior is undefined.

4) Finds the last character equal to ch.

5) Implicitly converts t to a string view sv as if by std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits> sv = t;, then finds the last character equal to one of characters in sv.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_convertible_v<const StringViewLike&,
                      std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>> is true and std::is_convertible_v<const StringViewLike&, const CharT*> is false.

In all cases, equality is checked by calling Traits::eq.

### Parameters

str

-

string identifying characters to search for

pos

-

position at which the search is to finish

count

-

length of character string identifying characters to search for

s

-

pointer to a character string identifying characters to search for

ch

-

character to search for

t

-

object (convertible to std::basic_string_view) identifying characters to search for

### Return value

Position of the found character or npos if no such character is found.

### Exceptions

1,4) Throws nothing.

5) noexcept specification:  
noexcept(std::is_nothrow_convertible_v<const T&, std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>>)

If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
const std::string path = "/root/config";
auto const pos = path.find_last_of('/');
const auto leaf = path.substr(pos + 1);
 
std::cout << leaf << '\n';
}

Output:

config

Correct behavior

LWG 141

C++98

overload (1) could only return npos if pos >= size()

the search range is
[​0​, size()) in this case

LWG 847

C++98

there was no exception safety guarantee

added strong exception safety guarantee

overloads (3,4) were noexcept

removed

overload (5) caused ambiguity in some cases

avoided by making it a template
