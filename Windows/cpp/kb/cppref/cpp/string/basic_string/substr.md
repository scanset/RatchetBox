basic_string substr( size_type pos = 0, size_type count = npos ) const;

(until C++23) 
(constexpr since C++20)

constexpr basic_string

    substr( size_type pos = 0, size_type count = npos ) const&;

(since C++23)

constexpr basic_string substr( size_type pos = 0, size_type count = npos ) &&;

(2)
(since C++23)

Returns a substring [pos, pos + count). If the requested substring extends past the end of the string, i.e. the count is greater than size() - pos (e.g. if count == npos), the returned substring is [pos, size()).

1) Equivalent to return basic_string(*this, pos, count);.

2) Equivalent to return basic_string(std::move(*this), pos, count);.

### Parameters

pos

-

position of the first character to include

count

-

length of the substring

### Return value

String containing the substring [pos, pos + count) or [pos, size()).

### Exceptions

std::out_of_range if pos > size().

If an exception is thrown for any reason, these functions have no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Complexity

Linear in count.

### Notes

The allocator of the returned string is default-constructed: the new allocator might not be a copy of get_allocator().

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::string a = "0123456789abcdefghij";
 
// count is npos, returns [pos, size())
std::string sub1 = a.substr(10);
std::cout << sub1 << '\n';
 
// both pos and pos + count are within bounds, returns [pos, pos + count)
std::string sub2 = a.substr(5, 3);
std::cout << sub2 << '\n';
 
// pos is within bounds, pos + count is not, returns [pos, size())
std::string sub4 = a.substr(a.size() - 3, 50);
// this is effectively equivalent to
// std::string sub4 = a.substr(17, 3);
// since a.size() == 20, pos == a.size() - 3 == 17, and a.size() - pos == 3
 
std::cout << sub4 << '\n';
 
try
{
// pos is out of bounds, throws
std::string sub5 = a.substr(a.size() + 3, 50);
std::cout << sub5 << '\n';
}
catch (const std::out_of_range& ex)
{
std::cout << ex.what() << '\n';
}
}

Possible output:

abcdefghij
567
hij
basic_string::substr: __pos (which is 23) > this->size() (which is 20)
