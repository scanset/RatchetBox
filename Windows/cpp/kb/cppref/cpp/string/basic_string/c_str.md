const CharT* c_str() const;

(noexcept since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++20)

Returns a pointer to a null-terminated character array with data equivalent to those stored in the string.

The pointer is such that the range [c_str(), c_str() + size()] is valid and the values in it correspond to the values stored in the string with an additional null character after the last position.

The pointer obtained from c_str() may be invalidated by:

- Passing a non-const reference to the string to any standard library function, or

- Calling non-const member functions on the string, excluding operator[], at(), front(), back(), begin(), rbegin(), end() and rend()(since C++11).

Writing to the character array accessed through c_str() is undefined behavior.

c_str() and data() perform the same function.

(since C++11)

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Pointer to the underlying character storage.

c_str()[i] == operator[](i) for every i in [​0​, size()).

(until C++11)

c_str() + i == std::addressof(operator[](i)) for every i in [​0​, size()].

(since C++11)

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

The pointer obtained from c_str() may only be treated as a pointer to a null-terminated character string if the string object does not contain other null characters.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <cstring>
#include <string>
 
extern "C" void c_func(const char* c_str)
{
printf("c_func called with '%s'\n", c_str);
}
 
int main()
{
std::string const s("Emplary");
const char* p = s.c_str();
assert(s.size() == std::strlen(p));
assert(std::equal(s.begin(), s.end(), p));
assert(std::equal(p, p + s.size(), s.begin()));
assert('\0' == *(p + s.size()));
 
c_func(s.c_str());
}

Output:

c_func called with 'Emplary'
