void push_back( CharT ch );

(constexpr since C++20)

Appends the given character ch to the end of the string.

### Parameters

ch

-

the character to append

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Amortized constant.

### Exceptions

If the operation would cause size() to exceed max_size(), throws std::length_error.

If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Example

Run this code

#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::string str{"Short string"};
std::cout << "1) " << std::quoted(str) << ", size: " << str.size() << '\n';
 
str.push_back('!');
std::cout << "2) " << std::quoted(str) << ", size: " << str.size() << '\n';
}

Output:

1) "Short string", size: 12
2) "Short string!", size: 13
