size_type copy( CharT* dest, size_type count, size_type pos = 0 ) const;

(constexpr since C++20)

Copies a substring [pos, pos + count) to character string pointed to by dest. If the requested substring lasts past the end of the string, or if count == npos, the copied substring is [pos, size()).

The resulting character string is not null-terminated.

### Parameters

dest

-

pointer to the destination character string

count

-

length of the substring

pos

-

position of the first character to include

### Return value

Number of characters copied.

### Exceptions

std::out_of_range if pos > size().

If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Complexity

Linear in count.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::string foo("WINE");
 
// brace-initialization initializes all characters to 0,
// providing a null-terminator
char bar[4]{};
 
// do not copy the last char, to guarantee null-termination
foo.copy(bar, sizeof bar - 1);
 
std::cout << bar << '\n'; // requires bar to be null-terminated
}

Output:

WIN
