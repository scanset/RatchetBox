Interprets a floating point value in a string str. 

Let ptr be an internal (to the conversion functions) pointer of type char* (1,3,5) or wchar_t* (2,4,6), accordingly. 

1) Calls std::strtof(str.c_str(), &ptr).

2) Calls std::wcstof(str.c_str(), &ptr).

3) Calls std::strtod(str.c_str(), &ptr).

4) Calls std::wcstod(str.c_str(), &ptr).

5) Calls std::strtold(str.c_str(), &ptr).

6) Calls std::wcstold(str.c_str(), &ptr).

Function discards any whitespace characters (as determined by std::isspace) until first non-whitespace character is found. Then it takes as many characters as possible to form a valid floating-point representation and converts them to a floating-point value. The valid floating-point value can be one of the following:

- decimal floating-point expression. It consists of the following parts:

- (optional) plus or minus sign

- nonempty sequence of decimal digits optionally containing decimal-point character (as determined by the current C locale) (defines significand)

- (optional) e or E followed with optional minus or plus sign and nonempty sequence of decimal digits (defines exponent to base 10)

- hexadecimal floating-point expression. It consists of the following parts:

- (optional) plus or minus sign

- 0x or 0X

- nonempty sequence of hexadecimal digits optionally containing a decimal-point character (as determined by the current C locale) (defines significand)

- (optional) p or P followed with optional minus or plus sign and nonempty sequence of decimal digits (defines exponent to base 2)

- infinity expression. It consists of the following parts:

- (optional) plus or minus sign

- INF or INFINITY ignoring case

- not-a-number expression. It consists of the following parts:

- (optional) plus or minus sign

- NAN or NAN(char_sequence) ignoring case of the NAN part. char_sequence can only contain digits, Latin letters, and underscores. The result is a quiet NaN floating-point value.

- any other expression that may be accepted by the currently installed C locale

If pos is not a null pointer, then ptr will receive the address of the first unconverted character in str.c_str(), and the index of that character will be calculated and stored in *pos, giving the number of characters that were processed by the conversion.

### Parameters

str

-

the string to convert

pos

-

address of an integer to store the number of characters processed

### Return value

The string converted to the specified floating point type.

### Exceptions

std::invalid_argument if no conversion could be performed.

std::out_of_range if the converted value would fall out of the range of the result type or if the underlying function (std::strtof, std::strtod or std::strtold) sets errno to ERANGE.
