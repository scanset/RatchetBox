static char_type*

    copy( char_type* dest, const char_type* src, std::size_t count );

(constexpr since C++20)

Copies count characters from the character string pointed to by src to the character string pointed to by dest.

If [dest, dest + count) and [src, src + count) overlap, the behavior is undefined.
