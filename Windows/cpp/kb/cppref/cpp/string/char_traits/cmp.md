Compares two characters.

1) Compares a and b for equality, behaves identically to

- static_cast<unsigned char>(a) == static_cast<unsigned char>(b), if char_type is char,

- a == b otherwise.

2) Compares a and b in such a way that they are totally ordered, behaves identically to

- static_cast<unsigned char>(a) < static_cast<unsigned char>(b), if char_type is char,

- a < b otherwise.

See CharTraits for the general requirements on character traits for X::eq and X::lt.

### Parameters

a, b

-

character values to compare

### Return value

1) true if a and b are equal, false otherwise.

2) true if a is less than b, false otherwise.

### Complexity

Constant.

LWG 467

C++98

for std::char_traits<char>, the semantics of eq() and lt()
are the same as the built-in == and < on char respectively[1]

changed to built-in == and
< on unsigned char

- ↑ Most implementations call std::memcmp() for efficiency, which interprets the data as arrays of unsigned char. If char is signed on such implementations, std::char_traits<char> fails to satisfy the requirements of CharTraits.
