static int_type not_eof( int_type e );

(constexpr since C++11)
(noexcept since C++11)

Given e, produces a suitable value that is not equivalent to eof.

This function is typically used when a value other than eof needs to be returned, such as in implementations of std::basic_streambuf::overflow().

See CharTraits for the general requirements on character traits for X::not_eof.

### Parameters

e

-
