> class basic_string_view;

(since C++17)

The class template basic_string_view describes an object that can refer to a constant contiguous sequence of CharT with the first element of the sequence at position zero.

For a basic_string_view str, pointers, iterators, and references to elements of str are invalidated when an operation invalidates a pointer in the range [str.data(), str.data() + str.size()).

Every specialization of std::basic_string_view is a TriviallyCopyable type.

(since C++23)

A typical implementation holds only two members: a pointer to constant CharT and a size.

Several typedefs for common character types are provided:

Defined in header <string_view> 

Type

Definition

std::string_view (C++17)

std::basic_string_view<char>

std::wstring_view (C++17)

std::basic_string_view<wchar_t>

std::u8string_view (C++20)

std::basic_string_view<char8_t>

std::u16string_view (C++17)

std::basic_string_view<char16_t>

std::u32string_view (C++17)

std::basic_string_view<char32_t>

### Template parameters

CharT

-

character type

Traits

-

CharTraits class specifying the operations on the character type. Like for std::basic_string, Traits::char_type must name the same type as CharT or the program is ill-formed.

### Member types

Nested type

Definition

traits_type

Traits

value_type

CharT

pointer

CharT*

const_pointer

const CharT*

reference

CharT&

const_reference

const CharT&

const_iterator

implementation-defined constant LegacyRandomAccessIterator,

and LegacyContiguousIterator
(until C++20)

ConstexprIterator, and contiguous_iterator
(since C++20)

whose value_type is CharT

iterator

const_iterator

const_reverse_iterator

std::reverse_iterator<const_iterator>

reverse_iterator

const_reverse_iterator

size_type

std::size_t

difference_type

std::ptrdiff_t

Note: iterator and const_iterator are the same type because string views are views into constant character sequences.

All requirements on the iterator types of a Container applies to the iterator and const_iterator types of basic_string_view as well.

find

rfind

(public member function)

find_first_of

find first occurrence of characters 
(public member function)

find_last_of

find last occurrence of characters 
(public member function)

find_first_not_of

find first absence of characters 
(public member function)

find_last_not_of

find last absence of characters 
(public member function)

### Constants

npos

[static]

special value. The exact meaning depends on the context 
(public static member constant)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator!=operator<operator>operator<=operator>=operator<=>

(C++17)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(C++20)

lexicographically compares two string views 
(function template)

#### Input/output 

operator<<

(C++17)

performs stream output on string views 
(function template)

### Literals

Defined in inline namespace std::literals::string_view_literals 

operator""sv

(C++17)

creates a string view of a character array literal 
(function)

### Helper classes

std::hash<std::string_view>std::hash<std::wstring_view>std::hash<std::u8string_view>std::hash<std::u16string_view>std::hash<std::u32string_view>

(C++17)(C++17)(C++20)(C++17)(C++17)

hash support for string views 
(class template specialization)

### Helper templates

template< class CharT, class Traits >

inline constexpr bool

ranges::enable_borrowed_range<std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>> = true;

(since C++20)

This specialization of ranges::enable_borrowed_range makes basic_string_view satisfy borrowed_range.

template< class CharT, class Traits >

inline constexpr bool

ranges::enable_view<std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>> = true;

(since C++20)

This specialization of ranges::enable_view makes basic_string_view satisfy view.

### Deduction guides

(since C++20)

### Notes

It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that std::string_view does not outlive the pointed-to character array:

std::string_view good{"a string literal"};
// "Good" case: `good` points to a static array.
// String literals reside in persistent data storage.
 
std::string_view bad{"a temporary string"s};
// "Bad" case: `bad` holds a dangling pointer since the std::string temporary,
// created by std::operator""s, will be destroyed at the end of the statement.

Specializations of std::basic_string_view are already trivially copyable types in all existing implementations, even before the formal requirement introduced in C++23.

#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
 
int main()
{
constexpr std::string_view unicode[]{"▀▄─", "▄▀─", "▀─▄", "▄─▀"};
 
for (int y{}, p{}; y != 6; ++y, p = ((p + 1) % 4))
{
for (int x{}; x != 16; ++x)
std::cout << unicode[p];
std::cout << '\n';
