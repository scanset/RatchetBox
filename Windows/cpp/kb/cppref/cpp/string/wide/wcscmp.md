Defined in header <cwchar>

int wcscmp( const wchar_t* lhs, const wchar_t* rhs );

Compares two null-terminated wide strings lexicographically.

The sign of the result is the sign of the difference between the values of the first pair of wide characters that differ in the strings being compared.

The behavior is undefined if lhs or rhs are not pointers to null-terminated wide strings.

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

pointers to the null-terminated wide strings to compare

### Return value

Negative value if lhs appears before rhs in lexicographical order.

Zero if lhs and rhs compare equal.

Positive value if lhs appears after rhs in lexicographical order.

### Notes

This function is not locale-sensitive, unlike std::wcscoll, and the order may not be meaningful when characters from different Unicode blocks are used together or when the order of code units does not match collation order.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <cwchar>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
std::vector<const wchar_t*> leaders
{
L"Ленин", L"Сталин", L"Маленков", L"Хрущёв",
L"Брежнев", L"Андропов", L"Черненко", L"Горбачёв"
};
 
std::ranges::sort(leaders, [](auto leaderLHS, auto leaderRHS)
{
return std::wcscmp(leaderLHS, leaderRHS) < 0;
});
 
std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
std::wcout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
for (auto leader : leaders)
std::wcout << leader[0] << ' ';
std::wcout << '\n';
}

Output:

А Б Г Л М С Х Ч
