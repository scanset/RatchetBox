Defined in header <cwchar>

const wchar_t* wcspbrk( const wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src );

wchar_t* wcspbrk(       wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src );

Finds the first character in wide string pointed to by dest, that is also in wide string pointed to by src.

### Parameters

dest

-

pointer to the null-terminated wide string to be analyzed

src

-

pointer to the null-terminated wide string that contains the characters to search for

### Return value

Pointer to the first character in dest, that is also in src, or a null pointer if no such character exists.

### Notes

The name stands for "wide character string pointer break", because it returns a pointer to the first of the separator ("break") characters.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cwchar>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
const wchar_t* str = L"Hello world, friend of mine!";
const wchar_t* sep = L" ,!";
 
unsigned int cnt = 0;
do
{
str = std::wcspbrk(str, sep); // find separator
std::wcout << std::quoted(str) << L'\n';
if (str)
str += std::wcsspn(str, sep); // skip separator
++cnt; // increment word count
} while (str && *str);
 
std::wcout << L"There are " << cnt << L" words\n";
}

Output:

" world, friend of mine!"
", friend of mine!"
" of mine!"
" mine!"
"!"
There are 5 words
