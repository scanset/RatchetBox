const char* strrchr( const char* str, int ch );

char* strrchr(       char* str, int ch );

Finds the last occurrence of ch (after conversion to char) in the byte string pointed to by str. The terminating null character is considered to be a part of the string and can be found if searching for '\0'.

### Parameters

str

ch

character to search for

### Return value

Pointer to the found character in str, or null pointer if no such character is found.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
char input[] = "/home/user/hello.c";
char* output = std::strrchr(input, '/');
if (output)
std::cout << output + 1 << '\n';
}

Output:
