Defined in header <cstring>

char* strcat( char* dest, const char* src );

Appends a copy of the character string pointed to by src to the end of the character string pointed to by dest. The character src[0] replaces the null terminator at the end of dest. The resulting byte string is null-terminated.

The behavior is undefined if the destination array is not large enough for the contents of both src and dest and the terminating null character.

The behavior is undefined if the strings overlap.

### Parameters

dest

-

pointer to the null-terminated byte string to append to

src

-

pointer to the null-terminated byte string to copy from

### Return value

dest

### Notes

Because strcat needs to seek to the end of dest on each call, it is inefficient to concatenate many strings into one using strcat.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
 
int main() 
{
char str[50] = "Hello ";
char str2[50] = "World!";
std::strcat(str, str2);
std::strcat(str, " Goodbye World!");
std::puts(str);
}

Output:

Hello World! Goodbye World!
