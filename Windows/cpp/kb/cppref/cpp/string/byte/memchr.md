Defined in header <cstring>

const void* memchr( const void* ptr, int ch, std::size_t count );

void* memchr(       void* ptr, int ch, std::size_t count );

Converts ch to unsigned char and locates the first occurrence of that value in the initial count bytes (each interpreted as unsigned char) of the object pointed to by ptr.

This function behaves as if it reads the bytes sequentially and stops as soon as a matching bytes is found: if the array pointed to by ptr is smaller than count, but the match is found within the array, the behavior is well-defined.

(since C++17)

### Parameters

ptr

-

pointer to the object to be examined

ch

-

byte to search for

count

-

max number of bytes to examine

### Return value

Pointer to the location of the byte, or a null pointer if no such byte is found.

### Example

Search an array of characters.

Run this code

#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
char arr[] = {'a', '\0', 'a', 'A', 'a', 'a', 'A', 'a'};
char *pc = (char*) std::memchr(arr, 'A', sizeof arr);
if (pc != nullptr)
std::cout << "search character found\n";
else
std::cout << "search character not found\n";
}

Output:

search character found
