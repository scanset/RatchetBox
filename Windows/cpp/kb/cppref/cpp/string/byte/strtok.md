Defined in header <cstring>

char* strtok( char* str, const char* delim );

Finds the next token in a null-terminated byte string pointed to by str. The separator characters are identified by null-terminated byte string pointed to by delim.

This function is designed to be called multiple times to obtain successive tokens from the same string.

- If str is not a null pointer, the call is treated as the first call to strtok for this particular string. The function searches for the first character which is not contained in delim.

- If no such character was found, there are no tokens in str at all, and the function returns a null pointer. 

- If such character was found, it is the beginning of the token. The function then searches from that point on for the first character that is contained in delim. 

- If no such character was found, str has only one token, and the future calls to strtok will return a null pointer.

- If such character was found, it is replaced by the null character '\0' and the pointer to the following character is stored in a static location for subsequent invocations.

- The function then returns the pointer to the beginning of the token.

- If str is a null pointer, the call is treated as a subsequent call to strtok: the function continues from where it left in previous invocation. The behavior is the same as if the previously stored pointer is passed as str.

### Parameters

str

-

pointer to the null-terminated byte string to tokenize

delim

-

pointer to the null-terminated byte string identifying delimiters

### Return value

Pointer to the beginning of the next token or a nullptr if there are no more tokens.

### Notes

This function is destructive: it writes the '\0' characters in the elements of the string str. In particular, a string literal cannot be used as the first argument of std::strtok.

Each call to this function modifies a static variable: is not thread safe.

Unlike most other tokenizers, the delimiters in std::strtok can be different for each subsequent token, and can even depend on the contents of the previous tokens.

### Possible implementation

char* strtok(char* str, const char* delim)
{
static char* buffer;
 
if (str != nullptr)
buffer = str;
 
buffer += std::strspn(buffer, delim);
 
if (*buffer == '\0')
return nullptr;
 
char* const tokenBegin = buffer;
 
buffer += std::strcspn(buffer, delim);
 
if (*buffer != '\0')
*buffer++ = '\0';
 
return tokenBegin;
}

Actual C++ library implementations of this function delegate to the C library, where it may be implemented directly (as in MUSL libc), or in terms of its reentrant version (as in GNU libc).

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstring>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
 
int main() 
{
char input[] = "one + two * (three - four)!";
const char* delimiters = "! +- (*)";
char* token = std::strtok(input, delimiters);
while (token)
{
std::cout << std::quoted(token) << ' ';
token = std::strtok(nullptr, delimiters);
}
 
std::cout << "\nContents of the input string now:\n\"";
for (std::size_t n = 0; n < sizeof input; ++n)
{
if (const char c = input[n]; c != '\0')
std::cout << c;
else
std::cout << "\\0";
}
std::cout << "\"\n";
}

Output:

"one" "two" "three" "four" 
Contents of the input string now:
"one\0+ two\0* (three\0- four\0!\0"
