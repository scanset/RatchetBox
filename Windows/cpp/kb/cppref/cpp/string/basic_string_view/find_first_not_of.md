Finds the first character not equal to any of the characters in the given character sequence.

1) Finds the first character not equal to any of the characters of v in this view, starting at position pos.

2) Equivalent to find_first_not_of(basic_string_view(std::addressof(ch), 1), pos).

3) Equivalent to find_first_not_of(basic_string_view(s, count), pos).

4) Equivalent to find_first_not_of(basic_string_view(s), pos).

### Parameters

v

-

view to search for

pos

-

position at which to start the search

count

-

length of the string of characters to compare

s

-

pointer to a string of characters to compare

ch

-

character to compare

### Return value

Position of the first character not equal to any of the characters in the given string, or std::string_view::npos if no such character is found.

### Complexity

O(size() * v.size()) at worst.

### Example

Run this code

#include <string_view>
using namespace std::literals;
 
int main()
{
static_assert(2 == "BCDEF"sv.find_first_not_of("ABC"));
// ^
static_assert(4 == "BCDEF"sv.find_first_not_of("ABC", 4));
// ^
static_assert(1 == "BCDEF"sv.find_first_not_of('B'));
// ^
static_assert(3 == "BCDEF"sv.find_first_not_of('D', 2));
// ^
}
