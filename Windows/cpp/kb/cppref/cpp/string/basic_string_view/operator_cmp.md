Compares two views.

All comparisons are done via the compare() member function (which itself is defined in terms of Traits::compare()):

- Two views are equal if both the size of lhs and rhs are equal and each character in lhs has an equivalent character in rhs at the same position.

- The ordering comparisons are done lexicographically – the comparison is performed by a function equivalent to std::lexicographical_compare.

The implementation provides sufficient additional constexpr and noexcept overloads of these functions so that a basic_string_view<CharT,Traits> object sv may be compared to another object t with an implicit conversion to basic_string_view<CharT,Traits>, with semantics identical to comparing sv and basic_string_view<CharT,Traits>(t).

(until C++20)

The return type of three-way comparison operators (/*comp-cat*/) is Traits::comparison_category if that qualified-id denotes a type, std::weak_ordering otherwise. If /*comp-cat*/ is not a comparison category type, the program is ill-formed.

The <, <=, >, >=, and != operators are synthesized from operator<=> and operator== respectively.

(since C++20)

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

views to compare

### Return value

1-6) true if the corresponding comparison holds, false otherwise.

7) static_cast</*comp-cat*/>(lhs.compare(rhs) <=> 0).

### Complexity

Linear in the size of the views.

### Notes

Sufficient additional overloads can be implemented through non-deduced context in one parameter type.

(until C++20)

Three-way comparison result type of std::string_view, std::wstring_view, std::u8string_view, std::u16string_view and std::u32string_view is std::strong_ordering.

std::type_identity_t is used for non-deduced context, which makes arguments that implicitly convertible to the string view type comparable with the string view.

(since C++20)

### Example

Run this code

#include <string_view>
 
int main()
{
using namespace std::literals;
 
static_assert(""sv == ""sv);
 
static_assert(""sv == "", "Selects an additional overload until C++20.");
 
static_assert("" == ""sv, "Selects an additional overload until C++20."
"Uses a rewritten candidate since C++20.");
 
static_assert(!(""sv != ""sv), "Uses the rewritten candidate since C++20.");
 
static_assert(!(""sv != ""), "Selects an additional overload until C++20;"
"Uses a rewritten candidate since C++20.");
 
static_assert(!("" != ""sv), "Selects an additional overload until C++20."
"Uses a rewritten candidate since C++20.");
}
