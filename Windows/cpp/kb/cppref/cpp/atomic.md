C++ includes built-in support for threads, atomic operations, mutual exclusion, condition variables, and futures.

### Threads

Threads enable programs to execute across several processor cores.

Defined in header <thread> 

thread

(C++11)

manages a separate thread 
(class)

jthread

(C++20)

std::thread with support for auto-joining and cancellation 
(class)

#### Functions managing the current thread 

Defined in namespace this_thread 

yield

(C++11)

suggests that the implementation reschedule execution of threads 
(function)

get_id

(C++11)

returns the thread id of the current thread 
(function)

sleep_for

(C++11)

stops the execution of the current thread for a specified time duration 
(function)

sleep_until

(C++11)

stops the execution of the current thread until a specified time point 
(function)

### Cooperative cancellation (since C++20)

The components stop source, stop token, and stop callback can be used to asynchronously request that an operation stops execution in a timely manner, typically because the result is no longer required. Such a request is called a stop request.

These components specify the semantics of shared access to a stop state. Any object modeling any of these components that refer to the same stop state is an associated stop source, stop token, or stop callback, respectively.

The concepts stoppable-source, stoppable_token, and stoppable-callback-for specify the required syntax and model semantics of stop source, stop token, and stop callback, respectively.

(since C++26)

They are designed:

- to cooperatively cancel the execution such as for std::jthread, 

- to interrupt std::condition_variable_any waiting functions, 

- to perform stopped completion of an asynchronous operation created by execution::connect,

(since C++26)

- or for a custom execution management implementation. 

In fact, they do not even need to be used to "stop" anything, but can instead be used for a thread-safe one-time function(s) invocation trigger, for example.

### Condition variables

A condition variable is a synchronization primitive that allows multiple threads to communicate with each other. It allows some number of threads to wait (possibly with a timeout) for notification from another thread that they may proceed. A condition variable is always associated with a mutex.

### Latches and Barriers (since C++20)

Latches and barriers are thread coordination mechanisms that allow any number of threads to block until an expected number of threads arrive. A latch cannot be reused, while a barrier can be used repeatedly.

latch

(C++20)

single-use thread barrier 
(class)

Defined in header <barrier>

### Futures

The standard library provides facilities to obtain values that are returned and to catch exceptions that are thrown by asynchronous tasks (i.e. functions launched in separate threads). These values are communicated in a shared state, in which the asynchronous task may write its return value or store an exception, and which may be examined, waited for, and otherwise manipulated by other threads that hold instances of std::future or std::shared_future that reference that shared state.
