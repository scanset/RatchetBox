Defined in header <filesystem>

std::uintmax_t hard_link_count( const std::filesystem::path& p );

(1)
(since C++17)

std::uintmax_t hard_link_count( const std::filesystem::path& p,

                                std::error_code& ec ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++17)

Returns the number of hard links for the filesystem object identified by path p.

The non-throwing overload returns static_cast<uintmax_t>(-1) on errors.

### Parameters

p

-

path to examine

ec

-

out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload

### Return value

The number of hard links for p.

### Exceptions

Any overload not marked noexcept may throw std::bad_alloc if memory allocation fails.

1) Throws std::filesystem::filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with p as the first path argument and the OS error code as the error code argument.

2) Sets a std::error_code& parameter to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur.

### Example

Run this code

#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
// On a POSIX-style filesystem, each directory has at least 2 hard links:
// itself and the special member pathname "."
fs::path p = fs::current_path();
std::cout << "Number of hard links for current path is "
<< fs::hard_link_count(p) << '\n';
 
// Each ".." is a hard link to the parent directory, so the total number
// of hard links for any directory is 2 plus number of direct subdirectories
p = fs::current_path() / ".."; // Each dot-dot is a hard link to parent
std::cout << "Number of hard links for .. is "
<< fs::hard_link_count(p) << '\n';
}

Possible output:

Number of hard links for current path is 2
Number of hard links for .. is 3
