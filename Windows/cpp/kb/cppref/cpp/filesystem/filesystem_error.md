Defined in header <filesystem>

class filesystem_error;

(since C++17)

The class std::filesystem::filesystem_error defines an exception object that is thrown on failure by the throwing overloads of the functions in the filesystem library.

Inheritance diagram

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs the exception object 
(public member function)

operator=

replaces the exception object 
(public member function)

path1path2

returns the paths that were involved in the operation that caused the error 
(public member function)

what

returns the explanatory string 
(public member function)

## Inherited from std::system_error

### Member functions

code

returns error code 
(public member function of std::system_error)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function of std::system_error)

## Inherited from std::runtime_error

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

(destructor)

[virtual]

destroys the exception object 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

### Notes

In order to ensure that copy functions of filesystem_error are noexcept, typical implementations store an object holding the return value of what() and two std::filesystem::path objects referenced by path1() and path2() respectively in a separately-allocated reference-counted storage.

Currently the MS STL implementation is non-conforming: objects mentioned above are stored directly in the filesystem object, which makes the copy functions not noexcept.

### Example

Run this code

#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>
#include <system_error>
 
int main()
{
const std::filesystem::path from{"/none1/a"}, to{"/none2/b"};
 
try
{
std::filesystem::copy_file(from, to); // throws: files do not exist
}
catch (std::filesystem::filesystem_error const& ex)
{
std::cout << "what(): " << ex.what() << '\n'
<< "path1(): " << ex.path1() << '\n'
<< "path2(): " << ex.path2() << '\n'
<< "code().value(): " << ex.code().value() << '\n'
<< "code().message(): " << ex.code().message() << '\n'
<< "code().category(): " << ex.code().category().name() << '\n';
}
 
// All functions have non-throwing equivalents
std::error_code ec;
std::filesystem::copy_file(from, to, ec); // does not throw
std::cout << "\nNon-throwing form sets error_code: " << ec.message() << '\n';
}

Possible output:

what(): filesystem error: cannot copy file: No such file or directory [/none1/a] [/none2/b]
path1(): "/none1/a"
path2(): "/none2/b"
code().value(): 2
code().message(): No such file or directory
code().category(): generic
 
Non-throwing form sets error_code: No such file or directory
