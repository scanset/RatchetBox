std::filesystem::file_status status() const;

(1)
(since C++17)

std::filesystem::file_status status( std::error_code& ec ) const noexcept;

(2)
(since C++17)

std::filesystem::file_status symlink_status() const;

(3)
(since C++17)

std::filesystem::file_status symlink_status( std::error_code& ec ) const noexcept;

(4)
(since C++17)

1,2) Returns status of the entry, as if determined by a filesystem::status call (symlinks are followed to their targets).

3,4) Returns status of the entry, as if determined by a filesystem::symlink_status call (symlinks are not followed).

### Parameters

ec

-

out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload

### Return value

The status of the file referred to by the entry.

### Exceptions

Any overload not marked noexcept may throw std::bad_alloc if memory allocation fails.

1,3) Throws std::filesystem::filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with p as the first path argument and the OS error code as the error code argument.

2,4) Sets a std::error_code& parameter to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur.

### Notes

Many low-level OS APIs for directory traversal retrieve file attributes along with the next directory entry. The constructors and the non-const member functions of std::filesystem::directory_iterator store these attributes, if any, in the pointed-to std::filesystem::directory_entry without calling directory_entry::refresh, which makes it possible to examine the attributes of the directory entries as they are being iterated over, without making additional system calls.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <filesystem>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/un.h>
#include <unistd.h>
 
namespace fs = std::filesystem;
 
void demo_status(const fs::path& p, fs::file_status s)
{
std::cout << p;
// alternative: switch(s.type()) { case fs::file_type::regular: ...}
if (fs::is_regular_file(s))
std::cout << " is a regular file\n";
if (fs::is_directory(s))
std::cout << " is a directory\n";
if (fs::is_block_file(s))
std::cout << " is a block device\n";
if (fs::is_character_file(s))
std::cout << " is a character device\n";
if (fs::is_fifo(s))
std::cout << " is a named IPC pipe\n";
if (fs::is_socket(s))
std::cout << " is a named IPC socket\n";
if (fs::is_symlink(s))
std::cout << " is a symlink\n";
if (!fs::exists(s))
std::cout << " does not exist\n";
}
 
int main()
{
// create files of different kinds
fs::create_directory("sandbox");
fs::create_directory("sandbox/dir");
std::ofstream{"sandbox/file"}; // create regular file
fs::create_symlink("file", "sandbox/symlink");
 
mkfifo("sandbox/pipe", 0644);
sockaddr_un addr;
addr.sun_family = AF_UNIX;
std::strcpy(addr.sun_path, "sandbox/sock");
int fd = socket(PF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
bind(fd, reinterpret_cast<sockaddr*>(&addr), sizeof addr);
 
// demo different status accessors
for (auto it{fs::directory_iterator("sandbox")}; it != fs::directory_iterator(); ++it)
demo_status(*it, it->symlink_status()); // use cached status from directory entry
demo_status("/dev/null", fs::status("/dev/null")); // direct calls to status
demo_status("/dev/sda", fs::status("/dev/sda"));
demo_status("sandbox/no", fs::status("/sandbox/no"));
 
// cleanup (prefer std::unique_ptr-based custom deleters)
close(fd);
fs::remove_all("sandbox");
}

Possible output:

"sandbox/file" is a regular file
"sandbox/dir" is a directory
"sandbox/pipe" is a named IPC pipe
"sandbox/sock" is a named IPC socket
"sandbox/symlink" is a symlink
"/dev/null" is a character device
"/dev/sda" is a block device
"sandbox/no" does not exist
