Defined in header <filesystem>

enum class perms;

(since C++17)

This type represents file access permissions.

perms satisfies the requirements of BitmaskType (which means the bitwise operators operator&, operator|, operator^, operator~, operator&=, operator|=, and operator^= are defined for this type). none represents the empty bitmask; every other enumerator represents a distinct bitmask element.

Access permissions model POSIX permission bits, and any individual file permissions (as reported by filesystem::status) are a combination of some of the following bits:

### Member constants

Member constant

Value (octal)

POSIX equivalent

Meaning

none

​0​

No permission bits are set

owner_read

0400

S_IRUSR

File owner has read permission

owner_write

0200

S_IWUSR

File owner has write permission

owner_exec

0100

S_IXUSR

File owner has execute/search permission

owner_all

0700

S_IRWXU

File owner has read, write, and execute/search permissions
Equivalent to owner_read | owner_write | owner_exec

group_read

040

S_IRGRP

The file's user group has read permission

group_write

020

S_IWGRP

The file's user group has write permission

group_exec

010

S_IXGRP

The file's user group has execute/search permission

group_all

070

S_IRWXG

The file's user group has read, write, and execute/search permissions
Equivalent to group_read | group_write | group_exec

others_read

04

S_IROTH

Other users have read permission

others_write

02

S_IWOTH

Other users have write permission

others_exec

01

S_IXOTH

Other users have execute/search permission

others_all

07

S_IRWXO

Other users have read, write, and execute/search permissions
Equivalent to others_read | others_write | others_exec

all

0777

All users have read, write, and execute/search permissions
Equivalent to owner_all | group_all | others_all

set_uid

04000

S_ISUID

Set user ID to file owner user ID on execution

set_gid

02000

S_ISGID

Set group ID to file's user group ID on execution

sticky_bit

01000

S_ISVTX

Implementation-defined meaning, but POSIX XSI specifies that when set on a directory, only file owners may delete files even if the directory is writeable to others (used with /tmp)

mask

07777

All valid permission bits.
Equivalent to all | set_uid | set_gid | sticky_bit

Additionally, the following constants of this type are defined, which do not represent permissions:

Member constant

Value (hex)

Meaning

unknown

0xFFFF

Unknown permissions (e.g. when filesystem::file_status is created without permissions)

### Notes

Permissions may not necessarily be implemented as bits, but they are treated that way conceptually.

Some permission bits may be ignored on some systems, and changing some bits may automatically change others (e.g. on platforms without owner/group/all distinction, setting any of the three write bits set all three).

### Example

Run this code

#include <filesystem>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
 
void demo_perms(std::filesystem::perms p)
{
using std::filesystem::perms;
auto show = [=](char op, perms perm)
{
std::cout << (perms::none == (perm & p) ? '-' : op);
};
show('r', perms::owner_read);
show('w', perms::owner_write);
show('x', perms::owner_exec);
show('r', perms::group_read);
show('w', perms::group_write);
show('x', perms::group_exec);
show('r', perms::others_read);
show('w', perms::others_write);
show('x', perms::others_exec);
std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
std::ofstream("test.txt"); // create file
 
std::cout << "Created file with permissions: ";
demo_perms(std::filesystem::status("test.txt").permissions());
 
std::filesystem::permissions(
"test.txt",
std::filesystem::perms::owner_all | std::filesystem::perms::group_all,
std::filesystem::perm_options::add
);
 
std::cout << "After adding u+rwx and g+rwx: ";
demo_perms(std::filesystem::status("test.txt").permissions());
 
std::filesystem::remove("test.txt");
}

Possible output:

Created file with permissions: rw-r--r--
After adding u+rwx and g+wrx: rwxrwxr--
