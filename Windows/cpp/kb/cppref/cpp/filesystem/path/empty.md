bool empty() const noexcept;

(since C++17)

Checks if the path in generic format is empty.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if the path is empty, false otherwise.

### Notes

An empty path can be obtained by calling clear and by default-constructing a path. It can also be returned by a path decomposition function (such as extension) if the corresponding component is not present in the path.

An empty path is classified as a relative path.
