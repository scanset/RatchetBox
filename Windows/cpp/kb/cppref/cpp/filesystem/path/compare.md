int compare( const path& p ) const noexcept;

(1)
(since C++17)

int compare( const string_type& str ) const;

int compare( std::basic_string_view<value_type> str ) const;

(2)
(since C++17)

int compare( const value_type* s ) const;

(3)
(since C++17)

Compares the lexical representations of the path and another path.

1) If root_name().native().compare(p.root_name().native()) is nonzero, returns that value. 

Otherwise, if has_root_directory() != p.has_root_directory(), returns a value less than zero if has_root_directory() is false and a value greater than zero otherwise.

Otherwise returns a value less than, equal to or greater than ​0​ if the relative portion of the path (relative_path()) is respectively lexicographically less than, equal to or greater than the relative portion of p (p.relative_path()). Comparison is performed element-wise, as if by iterating both paths from begin() to end() and comparing the result of native() for each element.

2) Equivalent to compare(path(str)).

3) Equivalent to compare(path(s)).

### Parameters

p

-

a path to compare to

str

-

a string or string view representing path to compare to

s

-

a null-terminated string representing path to compare to

### Return value

A value less than ​0​ if the path is lexicographically less than the given path.

A value equal to ​0​ if the path is lexicographically equal to the given path.

A value greater than ​0​ if the path is lexicographically greater than the given path.

### Exceptions

2,3) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

### Notes

For two-way comparisons, binary operators may be more suitable.

### Example

Run this code

#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;
 
void demo(fs::path p1, fs::path p2, std::string_view msg)
{
std::cout << p1;
const int rc = p1.compare(p2); 
if (rc < 0)
std::cout << " < ";
else if (rc > 0)
std::cout << " > ";
else
std::cout << " == ";
std::cout << p2 << " \t: " << msg << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
demo("/a/b/", "/a/b/", "simple");
demo("/a/b/", "/a/b/c", "simple");
demo("/a/b/../b", "/a/b", "no canonical conversion");
demo("/a/b", "/a/b/.", "no canonical conversion");
demo("/a/b/", "a/c", "absolute paths order after relative ones");
}

Output:

"/a/b/" == "/a/b/"  : simple
"/a/b/" < "/a/b/c" : simple
"/a/b/../b" > "/a/b" : no canonical conversion
"/a/b" < "/a/b/." : no canonical conversion
"/a/b/" > "a/c"  : absolute paths order after relative ones
