friend std::strong_ordering

(since C++20)

Compares two paths lexicographically.

1) Checks whether lhs and rhs are equal. Equivalent to !(lhs < rhs) && !(rhs < lhs).

2) Checks whether lhs and rhs are not equal. Equivalent to !(lhs == rhs).

3) Checks whether lhs is less than rhs. Equivalent to lhs.compare(rhs) < 0.

4) Checks whether lhs is less than or equal to rhs. Equivalent to !(rhs < lhs).

5) Checks whether lhs is greater than rhs. Equivalent to rhs < lhs.

6) Checks whether lhs is greater than or equal to rhs. Equivalent to !(lhs < rhs).

7) Obtains the three-way comparison result of lhs and rhs. Equivalent to lhs.compare(rhs) <=> 0.

These functions are not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::filesystem::path is an associated class of the arguments. This prevents undesirable conversions in the presence of a using namespace std::filesystem; using-directive.

The <, <=, >, >=, and != operators are synthesized from operator<=> and operator== respectively.

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

the paths to compare

### Return value

1-6) true if the corresponding comparison yields, false otherwise.

7) std::strong_ordering::less if lhs is less than rhs, otherwise std::strong_ordering::greater if rhs is less than lhs, otherwise std::strong_ordering::equal.

### Notes

Path equality and equivalence have different semantics.

In the case of equality, as determined by operator==, only lexical representations are compared. Therefore, path("a") == path("b") is never true.

In the case of equivalence, as determined by std::filesystem::equivalent(), it is checked whether two paths resolve to the same file system object. Thus equivalent("a", "b") will return true if the paths resolve to the same file.
