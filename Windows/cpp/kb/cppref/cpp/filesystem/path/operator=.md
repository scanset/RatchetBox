path& operator=( const path& p );

(1)
(since C++17)

path& operator=( path&& p ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++17)

path& operator=( string_type&& source );

(3)
(since C++17)

template< class Source >

path& operator=( const Source& source );

(4)
(since C++17)

1) Replaces the contents of *this with a pathname whose both native and generic format representations equal those of p.

2) Replaces the contents of *this with a pathname whose both native and generic format representations equal those of p, possibly using move semantics: p is left in a valid, but unspecified state.

3) Replaces the contents of *this with a new path value constructed from detected-format source, which is left in valid, but unspecified state. Equivalent to assign(std::move(source)).

4) Replaces the contents of *this with a new path value constructed from detected-format source as if by overload (4) of the path constructor. Equivalent to assign(source).

(4) participates in overload resolution only if Source and path are not the same type, and either:

- Source is a specialization of std::basic_string or std::basic_string_view, or

- std::iterator_traits<std::decay_t<Source>>::value_type is valid and denotes a possibly const-qualified encoding character type (char, char8_t, (since C++20)char16_t, char32_t, or wchar_t).

### Parameters

p

-

a path to assign

source

-

a std::basic_string, std::basic_string_view, pointer to a null-terminated character/wide character string, or an input iterator that points to a null-terminated character/wide character sequence. The character type must be one of char, char8_t, (since C++20)char16_t, char32_t, wchar_t

### Return value

*this

### Example

Run this code

#include <filesystem>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
fs::path p = "C:/users/abcdef/AppData/Local";
p = p / "Temp"; // move assignment
const wchar_t* wstr = L"D:/猫.txt";
p = wstr; // assignment from a source
}
