path& assign( string_type&& source );

(1)
(since C++17)

template< class Source >

path& assign( const Source& source );

(2)
(since C++17)

template< class InputIt >

path& assign( InputIt first, InputIt last );

(3)
(since C++17)

Replaces the contents to the path object by a new pathname constructed from the given character sequence.

1) Assigns the pathname identified by the detected-format string source, which is left in valid, but unspecified state.

2) Assigns the pathname identified by the detected-format character range source.

3) Assigns the pathname identified by detected-format character range [first, last).

(2) participates in overload resolution only if Source and path are not the same type, and either:

- Source is a specialization of std::basic_string or std::basic_string_view, or

- std::iterator_traits<std::decay_t<Source>>::value_type is valid and denotes a possibly const-qualified encoding character type (char, char8_t, (since C++20)char16_t, char32_t, or wchar_t).

### Parameters

source

-

a character range to use, represented as std::string, std::string_view, pointer to a null-terminated multibyte string, or as an input iterator with char value type that points to a null-terminated multibyte string

first, last

-

a character range to use

Type requirements

-

InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

-

The value type of InputIt must be one of the encoded character types (char, wchar_t, char16_t and char32_t)
