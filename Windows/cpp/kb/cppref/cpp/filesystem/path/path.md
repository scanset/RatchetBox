Constructs a new path object.

1) Constructs an empty path.

2) Copy constructor. Constructs a path whose pathname, in both native and generic formats, is the same as that of p.

3) Move constructor. Constructs a path whose pathname, in both native and generic formats, is the same as that of p, p is left in valid but unspecified state.

4-6) Constructs the path from a character sequence (format interpreted as specified by fmt) provided by source (4,5), which is a pointer or an input iterator to a null-terminated character/wide character sequence, an std::basic_string or an std::basic_string_view, or represented as a pair of input iterators [first, last) (6). Any of the character types char, char8_t, (since C++20)char16_t, char32_t, wchar_t is allowed, and the method of conversion to the native character set depends on the character type used by source.

- If the source character type is char, the encoding of the source is assumed to be the native narrow encoding (so no conversion takes place on POSIX systems).

- If the source character type is char8_t, conversion from UTF-8 to native filesystem encoding is used.

(since C++20)

- If the source character type is char16_t, conversion from UTF-16 to native filesystem encoding is used.

- If the source character type is char32_t, conversion from UTF-32 to native filesystem encoding is used.

- If the source character type is wchar_t, the input is assumed to be the native wide encoding (so no conversion takes places on Windows).

7,8) Constructs the path from a character sequence (format interpreted as specified by fmt) provided by source (7), which is a pointer or an input iterator to a null-terminated character sequence, an std::string, an std::string_view, or represented as a pair of input iterators [first, last) (8). The only character type allowed is char. Uses loc to perform the character encoding conversion. If value_type is wchar_t, converts from to wide using the std::codecvt<wchar_t, char, std::mbstate_t> facet of loc. Otherwise, first converts to wide using the std::codecvt<wchar_t, char, std::mbstate_t> facet and then converts to filesystem native character type using std::codecvt<wchar_t,value_type> facet of loc.

(5) and (7) participate in overload resolution only if Source and path are not the same type, and either:

- Source is a specialization of std::basic_string or std::basic_string_view, or

- std::iterator_traits<std::decay_t<Source>>::value_type is valid and denotes a possibly const-qualified encoding character type (char, char8_t, (since C++20)char16_t, char32_t, or wchar_t).

### Parameters

p

-

a path to copy

source

-

std::basic_string, std::basic_string_view, pointer to a null-terminated character string, or input iterator with a character value type that points to a null-terminated character sequence (the character type must be char for overload (7))

first, last

-

pair of LegacyInputIterators that specify a character sequence

fmt

-

enumerator of type path::format which specifies how pathname format is to be interpreted

loc

-

locale that defines encoding conversion to use

Type requirements

-

InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

-

The value type of InputIt must be one of the character types char, wchar_t, char8_t, (since C++20)char16_t and char32_t to use the overload (6).

-

The value type of InputIt must be char to use the overload (8).

### Exceptions

2,4-8) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

### Notes

For portable pathname generation from Unicode strings, see u8path.

(until C++20)

path constructor supports creation from UTF-8 string when the source is a sequence of char8_t.

(since C++20)

### Example

Run this code

#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
fs::path p1 = "/usr/lib/sendmail.cf"; // portable format
fs::path p2 = "C:\\users\\abcdef\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\"; // native format
fs::path p3 = U"D:/猫.txt"; // UTF-32 string
fs::path p4 = u8"~/狗.txt"; // UTF-8 string
 
std::cout << "p1 = " << p1 << '\n'
<< "p2 = " << p2 << '\n'
<< "p3 = " << p3 << '\n'
<< "p4 = " << p4 << '\n';
}

Output:

p1 = "/usr/lib/sendmail.cf"
p2 = "C:\\users\\abcdef\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\"
p3 = "D:/猫.txt"
p4 = "~/狗.txt"
