Constructs new recursive directory iterator.

1) Default constructor. Constructs an end iterator.

2) Copy constructor.

3) Move constructor.

4-7) Constructs an iterator that refers to the first entry in the directory that p resolves to.

Reason: errors

### Parameters

p

-

path to the filesystem object to which the directory iterator will refer

ec

-

out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overloads

options

-

the set of BitmaskType options that control the behavior of the directory iterator

other

-

another directory iterator to use as source to initialize the directory iterator with

### Exceptions

Any overload not marked noexcept may throw std::bad_alloc if memory allocation fails.

4,5) Throws std::filesystem::filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with p as the first path argument and the OS error code as the error code argument.

6,7) Sets a std::error_code& parameter to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur.

### Notes

Recursive directory iterators do not follow directory symlinks by default. To enable this behavior, specify directory_options::follow_directory_symlink among the options option set.
