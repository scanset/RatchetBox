Constructs a new directory iterator.

1) Constructs the end iterator.

2) Constructs a directory iterator that refers to the first directory entry of a directory identified by p. If p refers to a non-existing file or not a directory, throws std::filesystem::filesystem_error.

3) Same as (2), but if std::filesystem::directory_options::skip_permission_denied is set in options and construction encounters a permissions denied error, constructs the end iterator and does not report an error.

4) Constructs a directory iterator that refers to the first directory entry of a directory identified by p. If p refers to a non-existing file or not a directory, returns the end iterator and sets ec.

5) Same as (4), but if std::filesystem::directory_options::skip_permission_denied is set in options and construction encounters a permissions denied error, constructs the end iterator and does not report an error.

6) Copy constructor.

7) Move constructor.

### Parameters

p

-

path to the filesystem object to which the directory iterator will refer

ec

-

out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overloads

options

-

the set of BitmaskType options that control the behavior of the directory iterator

other

-

another directory iterator to use as source to initialize the directory iterator with

### Exceptions

Any overload not marked noexcept may throw std::bad_alloc if memory allocation fails.

2,3) Throws std::filesystem::filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with p as the first path argument and the OS error code as the error code argument.

4,5) Sets a std::error_code& parameter to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur.

### Notes

To iterate over the current directory, construct the iterator as directory_iterator(".") instead of directory_iterator("").
