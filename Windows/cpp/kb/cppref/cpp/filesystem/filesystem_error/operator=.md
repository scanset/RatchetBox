filesystem_error& operator=( const filesystem_error& other ) noexcept;

(since C++17)

Assigns the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::filesystem::filesystem_error then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment.

### Parameters

other

-

another filesystem_error object to assign with

### Return value

*this

### Notes

Typical implementations store path objects referenced by path1() and path2() in a reference-counted storage. As a result, *this and other usually share their path objects after assignment.
