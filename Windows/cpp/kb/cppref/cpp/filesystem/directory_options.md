Defined in header <filesystem>

enum class directory_options {

    none = /* unspecified */,

    follow_directory_symlink = /* unspecified */,

    skip_permission_denied = /* unspecified */

};

(since C++17)

This type represents available options that control the behavior of the directory_iterator and recursive_directory_iterator.

directory_options satisfies the requirements of BitmaskType (which means the bitwise operators operator&, operator|, operator^, operator~, operator&=, operator|=, and operator^= are defined for this type). none represents the empty bitmask; every other enumerator represents a distinct bitmask element.
