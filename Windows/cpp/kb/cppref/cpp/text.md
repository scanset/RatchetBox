The text processing library includes components for dealing with text.

### Localization library

The headers <locale> and <clocale> provide internationalization support for character classification and string collation, numeric, monetary, and date/time formatting and parsing, and message retrieval.

### Regular expressions library (since C++11)

The header <regex> provides a class that represents regular expressions, which are a kind of mini-language used to perform pattern matching within strings.

### Formatting library (since C++20)

The header <format> provides facilities for type-safe and extensible string formatting that is an alternative to the printf family of functions, and intended to complement the existing C++ I/O streams library.

### Null-terminated sequence utilities

Null-terminated character sequences (NTCTS) are sequences of characters that are terminated by a null character (the value after value-initialization).

The strings library provides functions to create, inspect, and modify such sequences:

- null-terminated byte strings (NTBS) helper functions (including support of wide character types),

- null-terminated multibyte strings (NTMBS) helper functions.

### Primitive numeric conversions (since C++17)

In addition to sophisticated locale-dependent parsers and formatters provided by the C++ I/O library, the C I/O library, C++ string converters, and C string converters, the header <charconv> provides light-weight, locale-independent, non-allocating, non-throwing parsers and formatters for arithmetic types.
