std::jthread& operator=( std::jthread&& other ) noexcept;

(since C++20)

If *this still has an associated running thread (i.e. joinable() == true), calls request_stop() followed by join(). Assigns the state of other to *this and sets other to a default constructed state.

After this call, this->get_id() is equal to the value of other.get_id() prior to the call and the associated stop-state is also moved, and other no longer represents a thread of execution nor has any stop-state.

### Parameters

other

-

another jthread object to assign to this jthread object

### Return value

*this
