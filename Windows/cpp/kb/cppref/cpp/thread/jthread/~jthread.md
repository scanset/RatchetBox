~jthread();

(since C++20)

Destroys the jthread object.

If *this has an associated thread (joinable() == true), calls request_stop() and then join().

### Notes

The request_stop() has no effect if the jthread was previously requested to stop.

A jthread object does not have an associated thread after

- it was default-constructed.

- it was moved from.

- join() has been called.

- detach() has been called.

If join() throws an exception (e.g. because deadlock is detected), std::terminate() may be called.
