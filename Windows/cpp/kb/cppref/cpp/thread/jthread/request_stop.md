bool request_stop() noexcept;

(since C++20)

Issues a stop request to the internal stop-state, if it has not yet already had stop requested.

The determination is made atomically, and if stop was requested, the stop-state is atomically updated to avoid race conditions, such that:

- stop_requested() and stop_possible() can be concurrently invoked on other std::stop_tokens and std::stop_sources of the same shared stop-state.

- request_stop() can be concurrently invoked from multiple threads on the same jthread object or on other std::stop_source objects associated with the same stop-state, and only one will actually perform the stop request.

However, see the Notes section.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if this invocation made a stop request, otherwise false.

### Postconditions

For a std::stop_token retrieved by get_stop_token() or a std::stop_source retrieved by get_stop_source(), stop_requested() is true.

### Notes

If the request_stop() does issue a stop request (i.e., returns true), then any std::stop_callbacks registered for the same associated stop-state will be invoked synchronously, on the same thread request_stop() is issued on. If an invocation of a callback exits via an exception, std::terminate is called.

If a stop request has already been made, this function returns false. However there is no guarantee that another thread or std::stop_source object which has just (successfully) requested stop for the same stop-state is not still in the middle of invoking a std::stop_callback function.

If the request_stop() does issue a stop request (i.e., returns true), then all condition variables of base type std::condition_variable_any registered with an interruptible wait for std::stop_tokens associated with the jthread's internal stop-state will be awoken.

### Example

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
 
using namespace std::chrono_literals;
 
// Helper function to quickly show which thread printed what
void print(auto txt)
{
std::cout << std::this_thread::get_id() << ' ' << txt;
}
 
int main()
{
// A sleepy worker thread
std::jthread sleepy_worker(
[](std::stop_token stoken)
{
for (int i = 10; i; --i)
{
std::this_thread::sleep_for(300ms);
if (stoken.stop_requested())
{
print("Sleepy worker is requested to stop\n");
return;
}
print("Sleepy worker goes back to sleep\n");
}
});
 
// A waiting worker thread
// The condition variable will be awoken by the stop request.
std::jthread waiting_worker(
[](std::stop_token stoken)
{
std::mutex mutex;
std::unique_lock lock(mutex);
std::condition_variable_any().wait(lock, stoken, []{ return false; });
print("Waiting worker is requested to stop\n");
return;
});
 
// Sleep this thread to give threads time to spin
std::this_thread::sleep_for(400ms);
 
// std::jthread::request_stop() can be called explicitly:
print("Requesting stop of sleepy worker\n");
sleepy_worker.request_stop();
sleepy_worker.join();
print("Sleepy worker joined\n");
 
// Or automatically using RAII:
// waiting_worker's destructor will call request_stop()
// and join the thread automatically.
}
