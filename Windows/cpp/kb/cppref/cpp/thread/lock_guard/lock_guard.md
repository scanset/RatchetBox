explicit lock_guard( mutex_type& m );

(1)
(since C++11)

lock_guard( mutex_type& m, std::adopt_lock_t t );

(2)
(since C++11)

lock_guard( const lock_guard& ) = delete;

(3)
(since C++11)

Acquires ownership of the given mutex m.

1) Effectively calls m.lock().

2) Acquires ownership of the mutex m without attempting to lock it. The behavior is undefined if the current thread does not hold a non-shared lock (i.e., a lock acquired by lock, try_lock, try_lock_for, or try_lock_until) on m.

3) Copy constructor is deleted.

The behavior is undefined if m is destroyed before the lock_guard object is.

### Parameters

m

-

mutex to acquire ownership of

t

-

tag parameter used to select non-locking version of the constructor

### Exceptions

1) Throws any exceptions thrown by m.lock().

2) Throws nothing.
