Defined in header <future>

class future_error;

(since C++11)

The class std::future_error defines an exception object that is thrown on failure by the functions in the thread library that deal with asynchronous execution and shared states (std::future, std::promise, etc). Similar to std::system_error, this exception carries an error code compatible with std::error_code.

Inheritance diagram

### Member functions

(constructor)

creates a std::future_error object 
(public member function)

operator=

replaces the std::future_error object 
(public member function)

code

returns the error code 
(public member function)

what

returns the explanatory string specific to the error code 
(public member function)

## Inherited from std::logic_error

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

(destructor)

[virtual]

destroys the exception object 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

### Example

Run this code

#include <future>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::future<int> empty;
try
{
int n = empty.get(); // The behavior is undefined, but
// some implementations throw std::future_error
}
catch (const std::future_error& e)
{
std::cout << "Caught a future_error with code \"" << e.code()
<< "\"\nMessage: \"" << e.what() << "\"\n";
}
}

Possible output:

Caught a future_error with code "future:3"
Message: "No associated state"
