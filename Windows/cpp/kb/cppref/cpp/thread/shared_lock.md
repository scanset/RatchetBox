Defined in header <shared_mutex>

template< class Mutex >

class shared_lock;

(since C++14)

The class shared_lock is a general-purpose shared mutex ownership wrapper allowing deferred locking, timed locking and transfer of lock ownership. Locking a shared_lock locks the associated shared mutex in shared mode (to lock it in exclusive mode, std::unique_lock can be used).

The shared_lock class is movable, but not copyable – it meets the requirements of MoveConstructible and MoveAssignable but not of CopyConstructible or CopyAssignable.

shared_lock meets the Lockable requirements. If Mutex meets the SharedTimedLockable requirements, shared_lock also meets TimedLockable requirements.

In order to wait in a shared mutex in shared ownership mode, std::condition_variable_any can be used (std::condition_variable requires std::unique_lock and so can only wait in unique ownership mode).

### Template parameters

Mutex

-

the type of the shared mutex to lock. The type must meet the SharedLockable requirements

### Member types

mutex_type

Mutex

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a shared_lock, optionally locking the supplied mutex 
(public member function)

(destructor)

unlocks the associated mutex 
(public member function)

operator=

unlocks the mutex, if owned, and acquires ownership of another 
(public member function)

#### Shared locking 

lock

locks the associated mutex 
(public member function)

try_lock

tries to lock the associated mutex 
(public member function)

try_lock_for

tries to lock the associated mutex, for the specified duration 
(public member function)

try_lock_until

tries to lock the associated mutex, until a specified time point 
(public member function)

unlock

unlocks the associated mutex 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

swap

swaps the data members with another shared_lock 
(public member function)

release

disassociates the mutex without unlocking 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

mutex

returns a pointer to the associated mutex 
(public member function)

owns_lock

tests whether the lock owns its associated mutex 
(public member function)

operator bool

tests whether the lock owns its associated mutex 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

std::swap(std::shared_lock)

(C++14)

specializes the std::swap algorithm 
(function template)
