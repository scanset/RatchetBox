std::promise<void> specialization

void set_value_at_thread_exit();

(4)
(since C++11)

Stores the value into the shared state without making the state ready immediately. The state is made ready when the current thread exits, after all variables with thread-local storage duration have been destroyed.

The operation behaves as though set_value, set_exception, set_value_at_thread_exit, and set_exception_at_thread_exit acquire a single mutex associated with the promise object while updating the promise object.

Calls to this function do not introduce data races with calls to get_future (therefore they need not synchronize with each other).

### Parameters

value

-

value to store in the shared state

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

std::future_error on the following conditions:

- *this has no shared state. The error code is set to no_state.

- The shared state already stores a value or exception. The error code is set to promise_already_satisfied.

Additionally:

1) Any exception thrown by the constructor selected to copy an object of type R.

2) Any exception thrown by the constructor selected to move an object of type R.

### Example

Run this code

#include <future>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
 
int main()
{
using namespace std::chrono_literals;
std::promise<int> p;
std::future<int> f = p.get_future();
std::thread([&p]
{
std::this_thread::sleep_for(1s);
p.set_value_at_thread_exit(9);
}).detach();
 
std::cout << "Waiting... " << std::flush;
f.wait();
std::cout << "Done!\nResult is: " << f.get() << '\n';
}

Output:

Waiting... Done!
Result is: 9
