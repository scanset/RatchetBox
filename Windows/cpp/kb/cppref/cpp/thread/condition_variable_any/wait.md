template< class Lock >

void wait( Lock& lock );

(1)
(since C++11)

template< class Lock, class Predicate >

void wait( Lock& lock, Predicate pred );

(2)
(since C++11)

template< class Lock, class Predicate >

bool wait( Lock& lock, std::stop_token stoken, Predicate pred );

(3)
(since C++20)

wait causes the current thread to block until the condition variable is notified or a spurious wakeup occurs. pred can be optionally provided to detect spurious wakeup.

1) Atomically calls lock.unlock() and blocks on *this.

The thread will be unblocked when notify_all() or notify_one() is executed. It may also be unblocked spuriously.

When unblocked, calls lock.lock() (possibly blocking on the lock), then returns.

2,3) Waiting for a specific condition to become true, can be used to ignore spurious awakenings.

2) Equivalent to

while (!pred())
    wait(lock);

3) Registers *this for the duration of this call, to be notified if a stop request is made on stoken's associated stop-state; it is then equivalent to

while (!stoken.stop_requested())
{
    if (pred())
        return true;
    wait(lock);
}
return pred();

Right after wait returns, lock is locked by the calling thread. If this postcondition cannot be satisfied[1], calls std::terminate.

- ↑ This can happen if the re-locking of the mutex throws an exception.

### Parameters

lock

-

an lock which must be locked by the calling thread

stoken

-

a stop token to register interruption for

pred

-

the predicate to check whether the waiting can be completed

Type requirements

-

Lock must meet the requirements of BasicLockable.

-

Predicate must meet the requirements of FunctionObject.

-

pred() must be a valid expression, and its type and value category must meet the BooleanTestable requirements.

### Return value

1,2) (none)

3) The latest result of pred() before returning to the caller.

### Exceptions

1) Does not throw.

2,3) Any exception thrown by pred.

### Notes

The returned value of overload (3) indicates whether pred evaluated to true, regardless of whether there was a stop requested or not.

The effects of notify_one()/notify_all() and each of the three atomic parts of wait()/wait_for()/wait_until() (unlock+wait, wakeup, and lock) take place in a single total order that can be viewed as modification order of an atomic variable: the order is specific to this individual condition variable. This makes it impossible for notify_one() to, for example, be delayed and unblock a thread that started waiting just after the call to notify_one() was made.

### Example

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
 
std::condition_variable_any cv;
std::mutex cv_m; // This mutex is used for three purposes:
// 1) to synchronize accesses to i
// 2) to synchronize accesses to std::cerr
// 3) for the condition variable cv
int i = 0;
 
void waits()
{
std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(cv_m);
std::cerr << "Waiting... \n";
cv.wait(lk, []{ return i == 1; });
std::cerr << "...finished waiting. i == 1\n";
}
 
void signals()
{
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
{
std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(cv_m);
std::cerr << "Notifying...\n";
}
cv.notify_all();
 
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
 
{
std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(cv_m);
i = 1;
std::cerr << "Notifying again...\n";
}
cv.notify_all();
}
 
int main()
{
std::thread t1(waits), t2(waits), t3(waits), t4(signals);
t1.join(); 
t2.join(); 
t3.join();
t4.join();
}

Possible output:

Waiting...
Waiting...
Waiting...
Notifying...
Notifying again...
...finished waiting. i == 1
...finished waiting. i == 1
...finished waiting. i == 1

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

DR

Applied to

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

LWG 2114
(P2167R3)

C++11

convertibility to bool was too weak to reflect the expectation of implementations

requirements strengthened

LWG 2135

C++11

the behavior was unclear if lock.lock() throws an exception

calls std::terminate in this case
