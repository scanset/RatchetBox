Defined in header <thread>

template< class Rep, class Period >

void sleep_for( const std::chrono::duration<Rep, Period>& sleep_duration );

(since C++11)

Blocks the execution of the current thread for at least the specified sleep_duration.

This function may block for longer than sleep_duration due to scheduling or resource contention delays.

The standard recommends that a steady clock is used to measure the duration. If an implementation uses a system clock instead, the wait time may also be sensitive to clock adjustments.

### Parameters

sleep_duration

-

time duration to sleep

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown by clock, time_point, or duration during the execution (clocks, time points, and durations provided by the standard library never throw).

### Example

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
 
int main()
{
using namespace std::chrono_literals;
 
std::cout << "Hello waiter\n" << std::flush;
 
const auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
std::this_thread::sleep_for(2000ms);
const auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
const std::chrono::duration<double, std::milli> elapsed = end - start;
 
std::cout << "Waited " << elapsed << '\n';
}

Possible output:

Hello waiter
Waited 2000.13 ms
