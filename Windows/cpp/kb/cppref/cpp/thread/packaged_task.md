template< class > class packaged_task; //not defined

(since C++11)

template< class R, class ...ArgTypes > 

class packaged_task<R(ArgTypes...)>;

(2)
(since C++11)

The class template std::packaged_task wraps any Callable target (function, lambda expression, bind expression, or another function object) so that it can be invoked asynchronously. Its return value or exception thrown is stored in a shared state which can be accessed through std::future objects.

Just like std::function, std::packaged_task is a polymorphic, allocator-aware container: the stored callable target may be allocated on heap or with a provided allocator.

(until C++17)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs the task object 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destructs the task object 
(public member function)

operator=

moves the task object 
(public member function)

valid

checks if the task object has a valid function 
(public member function)

swap

swaps two task objects 
(public member function)

#### Getting the result 

get_future

returns a std::future associated with the promised result 
(public member function)

#### Execution 

operator()

executes the function 
(public member function)

make_ready_at_thread_exit

executes the function ensuring that the result is ready only once the current thread exits 
(public member function)

reset

resets the state abandoning any stored results of previous executions 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

std::swap(std::packaged_task)

(C++11)

specializes the std::swap algorithm 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::uses_allocator<std::packaged_task>

(C++11) (until C++17)

specializes the std::uses_allocator type trait 
(class template specialization)

### Deduction guides(since C++17)

### Example

Run this code

#include <cmath>
#include <functional>
#include <future>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
 
// unique function to avoid disambiguating the std::pow overload set
int f(int x, int y) { return std::pow(x, y); }
 
void task_lambda()
{
std::packaged_task<int(int, int)> task([](int a, int b)
{
return std::pow(a, b); 
});
std::future<int> result = task.get_future();
 
task(2, 9);
 
std::cout << "task_lambda:\t" << result.get() << '\n';
}
 
void task_bind()
{
std::packaged_task<int()> task(std::bind(f, 2, 11));
std::future<int> result = task.get_future();
 
task();
 
std::cout << "task_bind:\t" << result.get() << '\n';
}
 
void task_thread()
{
std::packaged_task<int(int, int)> task(f);
std::future<int> result = task.get_future();
 
std::thread task_td(std::move(task), 2, 10);
task_td.join();
 
std::cout << "task_thread:\t" << result.get() << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
task_lambda();
task_bind();
task_thread();
}

Output:

task_lambda: 512
task_bind: 2048
task_thread: 1024
