template< class Clock, class Duration >

bool try_acquire_until( const std::chrono::time_point<Clock, Duration>& abs_time );

(since C++20)

Tries to atomically decrement the internal counter by 1 if it is greater than ​0​; otherwise blocks until it is greater than ​0​ and can successfully decrement the internal counter, or the abs_time time point has been passed.

The programs is ill-formed if std::chrono::is_clock_v<Clock> is false.

### Preconditions

Clock meets the Clock requirements.

### Parameters

abs_time

-

the earliest time the function must wait until in order to fail

### Return value

true if it decremented the internal counter, otherwise false.

### Exceptions

May throw std::system_error or a timeout-related exception.

### Notes

In practice the function may take longer than abs_time to fail.
