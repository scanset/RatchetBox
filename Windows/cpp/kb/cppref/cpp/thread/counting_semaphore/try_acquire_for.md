template< class Rep, class Period >

bool try_acquire_for( const std::chrono::duration<Rep, Period>& rel_time );

(since C++20)

Tries to atomically decrement the internal counter by 1 if it is greater than ​0​; otherwise blocks until it is greater than ​0​ and can successfully decrement the internal counter, or the rel_time duration has been exceeded.

### Preconditions

(none)

### Parameters

rel_time

-

the minimum duration the function must wait for it to fail

### Return value

true if it decremented the internal counter, otherwise false.

### Exceptions

May throw std::system_error or a timeout-related exception.

### Notes

In practice the function may take longer than rel_time to fail.
