Defined in header <stop_token>

class stop_token;

(since C++20)

The stop_token class provides the means to check if a stop request has been made or can be made, for its associated std::stop_source object. It is essentially a thread-safe "view" of the associated stop-state.

The stop_token can also be passed to the constructor of std::stop_callback, such that the callback will be invoked if the stop_token's associated std::stop_source is requested to stop. And stop_token can be passed to the interruptible waiting functions of std::condition_variable_any, to interrupt the condition variable's wait if stop is requested.

Type

Definition

callback_type<Callback> (since C++26)

std::stop_callback<Callback>

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs new stop_token object 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destructs the stop_token object 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns the stop_token object 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

swap

swaps two stop_token objects 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

stop_requested

checks whether the associated stop-state has been requested to stop 
(public member function)

stop_possible

checks whether associated stop-state can be requested to stop 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==

(C++20)

compares two std::stop_token objects 
(function)

swap(std::stop_token)

(C++20)

specializes the std::swap algorithm 
(function)

### Notes

A stop_token object is not generally constructed independently, but rather retrieved from a std::jthread or std::stop_source. This makes it share the same associated stop-state as the std::jthread or std::stop_source.

Stop token and joining thread

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
 
using namespace std::literals::chrono_literals;
 
void f(std::stop_token stop_token, int value)
{
while (!stop_token.stop_requested())
{
std::cout << value++ << ' ' << std::flush;
std::this_thread::sleep_for(200ms);
}
std::cout << std::endl;
}
 
int main()
{
std::jthread thread(f, 5); // prints 5 6 7 8... for approximately 3 seconds
std::this_thread::sleep_for(3s);
// The destructor of jthread calls request_stop() and join().
}

Possible output:

5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
