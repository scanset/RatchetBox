void unlock();

(since C++11)

Unlocks the mutex.

The mutex must be locked by the current thread of execution, otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

This operation synchronizes-with (as defined in std::memory_order) any subsequent lock operation that obtains ownership of the same mutex.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

Throws nothing.

### Notes

unlock() is usually not called directly: std::unique_lock and std::lock_guard are used to manage exclusive locking.

### Example

This example shows how lock and unlock can be used to protect shared data.

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
 
int g_num = 0; // protected by g_num_mutex
std::mutex g_num_mutex;
 
void slow_increment(int id) 
{
for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)
{
g_num_mutex.lock();
int g_num_running = ++g_num;
g_num_mutex.unlock();
std::cout << id << " => " << g_num_running << '\n';
 
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
}
}
 
int main()
{
std::thread t1(slow_increment, 0);
std::thread t2(slow_increment, 1);
t1.join();
t2.join();
}

Possible output:

0 => 1
1 => 2
0 => 3
1 => 4
0 => 5
1 => 6
