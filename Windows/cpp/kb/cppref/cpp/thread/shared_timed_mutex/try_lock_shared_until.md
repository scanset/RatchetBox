template< class Clock, class Duration >

bool try_lock_shared_until( const std::chrono::time_point<Clock,Duration>& timeout_time );

(since C++14)

Tries to lock the mutex in shared mode. Blocks until specified timeout_time has been reached or the lock is acquired, whichever comes first. On successful lock acquisition returns true, otherwise returns false.

If timeout_time has already passed, this function behaves like try_lock_shared().

Clock must meet the Clock requirements. The program is ill-formed if std::chrono::is_clock_v<Clock> is false.(since C++20)

The standard recommends that the clock tied to timeout_time be used, in which case adjustments of the clock may be taken into account. Thus, the duration of the block might be more or less than timeout_time - Clock::now() at the time of the call, depending on the direction of the adjustment and whether it is honored by the implementation. The function also may block until after timeout_time has been reached due to process scheduling or resource contention delays.

As with try_lock_shared(), this function is allowed to fail spuriously and return false even if the mutex was not locked by any other thread at some point before timeout_time.

Prior unlock() operation on the same mutex synchronizes-with (as defined in std::memory_order) this operation if it returns true.

If try_lock_shared_until is called by a thread that already owns the mutex in any mode (shared or exclusive), the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

timeout_time

-

maximum time point to block until

### Return value

true if the shared lock ownership was acquired successfully, otherwise false.

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown by clock, time_point, or duration during the execution (clocks, time points, and durations provided by the standard library never throw).
