void unlock_shared();

(since C++14)

Releases the mutex from shared ownership by the calling thread.

The mutex must be locked by the current thread of execution in shared mode, otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

This operation synchronizes-with (as defined in std::memory_order) any subsequent lock() operation that obtains ownership of the same mutex.

### Parameters
