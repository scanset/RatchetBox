friend bool operator==( const stop_token& lhs, const stop_token& rhs ) noexcept;

(since C++20)

Compares two stop_token values.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::stop_token is an associated class of the arguments.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

stop_tokens to compare

### Return value

true if lhs and rhs have the same associated stop-state, or both have no associated stop-state, otherwise false.
