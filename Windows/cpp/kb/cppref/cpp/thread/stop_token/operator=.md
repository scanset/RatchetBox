std::stop_token& operator=( std::stop_token&& other ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++20)

Replaces the associated stop-state with that of other.

1) Copy-assigns the associated stop-state of other to that of *this. Equivalent to stop_token(other).swap(*this).

2) Move-assigns the associated stop-state of other to that of *this. After the assignment, *this contains the previous associated stop-state of other, and other has no associated stop-state. Equivalent to stop_token(std::move(other)).swap(*this).

### Parameters

other

-

another stop_token object to share the stop-state with to or acquire the stop-state from
