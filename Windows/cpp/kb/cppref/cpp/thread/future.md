The class template std::future provides a mechanism to access the result of asynchronous operations:

- An asynchronous operation (created via std::async, std::packaged_task, or std::promise) can provide a std::future object to the creator of that asynchronous operation.

- The creator of the asynchronous operation can then use a variety of methods to query, wait for, or extract a value from the std::future. These methods may block if the asynchronous operation has not yet provided a value.

- When the asynchronous operation is ready to send a result to the creator, it can do so by modifying shared state (e.g. std::promise::set_value) that is linked to the creator's std::future.

Note that std::future references shared state that is not shared with any other asynchronous return objects (as opposed to std::shared_future). 

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs the future object 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destructs the future object 
(public member function)

operator=

moves the future object 
(public member function)

share

transfers the shared state from *this to a shared_future and returns it 
(public member function)

#### Getting the result 

get

returns the result 
(public member function)

#### State 

valid

checks if the future has a shared state 
(public member function)

wait

waits for the result to become available 
(public member function)

wait_for

waits for the result, returns if it is not available for the specified timeout duration 
(public member function)

wait_until

waits for the result, returns if it is not available until specified time point has been reached 
(public member function)

### Examples

Run this code

#include <future>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
 
int main()
{
// future from a packaged_task
std::packaged_task<int()> task([]{ return 7; }); // wrap the function
std::future<int> f1 = task.get_future(); // get a future
std::thread t(std::move(task)); // launch on a thread
 
// future from an async()
std::future<int> f2 = std::async(std::launch::async, []{ return 8; });
 
// future from a promise
std::promise<int> p;
std::future<int> f3 = p.get_future();
std::thread([&p]{ p.set_value_at_thread_exit(9); }).detach();
 
std::cout << "Waiting..." << std::flush;
f1.wait();
f2.wait();
f3.wait();
std::cout << "Done!\nResults are: "
<< f1.get() << ' ' << f2.get() << ' ' << f3.get() << '\n';
t.join();
}

Output:

Waiting...Done!
Results are: 7 8 9

#### Example with exceptions

Run this code

#include <future>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
 
int main()
{
std::promise<int> p;
std::future<int> f = p.get_future();
 
std::thread t([&p]
{
try
{
// code that may throw
throw std::runtime_error("Example");
}
catch (...)
{
try
{
// store anything thrown in the promise
p.set_exception(std::current_exception());
}
catch (...) {} // set_exception() may throw too
}
});
 
try
{
std::cout << f.get();
}
catch (const std::exception& e)
{
std::cout << "Exception from the thread: " << e.what() << '\n';
}
t.join();
}

Output:

Exception from the thread: Example
