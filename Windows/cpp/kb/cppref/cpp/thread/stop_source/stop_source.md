explicit stop_source( std::nostopstate_t nss ) noexcept;

Constructs a new stop_source object.

1) Constructs a stop_source with new stop-state.

2) Constructs an empty stop_source with no associated stop-state.

3) Copy constructor. Constructs a stop_source whose associated stop-state is the same as that of other.

4) Move constructor. Constructs a stop_source whose associated stop-state is the same as that of other; other is left empty.

### Parameters

nss

-

an std::nostopstate_t placeholder object to construct an empty stop_source

other

-

another stop_source object to construct this stop_source object with

### Postconditions

1) stop_possible() is true and stop_requested() is false. 

2) stop_possible() and stop_requested() are both false.

3) *this and other share the same associated stop-state and compare equal.

4) *this has other's previously associated stop-state, and other.stop_possible() is false.

### Exceptions

1) std::bad_alloc if memory could not be allocated for the stop-state.
