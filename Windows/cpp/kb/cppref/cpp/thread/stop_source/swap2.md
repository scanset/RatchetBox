friend void swap( stop_source& lhs, stop_source& rhs ) noexcept;

(since C++20)

Overloads the std::swap algorithm for std::stop_source. Exchanges the stop-state of lhs with that of rhs. Effectively calls lhs.swap(rhs).

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::stop_source is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

stop_sources to swap

### Return value

(none)
