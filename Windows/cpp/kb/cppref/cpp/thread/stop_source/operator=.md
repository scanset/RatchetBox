std::stop_source& operator=( std::stop_source&& other ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++20)

Replaces the stop-state with that of other.

1) Copy-assigns the stop-state of other to that of *this. Equivalent to stop_source(other).swap(*this).

2) Move-assigns the stop-state of other to that of *this. After the assignment, *this contains the previous stop-state of other, and other has no stop-state. Equivalent to stop_source(std::move(other)).swap(*this).

### Parameters

other

-

another stop_source object to share the stop-state with to or acquire the stop-state from
