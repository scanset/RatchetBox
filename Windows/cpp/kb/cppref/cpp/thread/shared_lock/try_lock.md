bool try_lock();

(since C++14)

Tries to lock the associated mutex in shared mode without blocking. Effectively calls mutex()->try_lock_shared().

std::system_error is thrown if there is no associated mutex or if the mutex is already locked.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if the ownership of the mutex has been acquired successfully, false otherwise.

### Exceptions

- Any exceptions thrown by mutex()->try_lock_shared().

- If there is no associated mutex, std::system_error with an error code of std::errc::operation_not_permitted.

- If the mutex is already locked, std::system_error with an error code of std::errc::resource_deadlock_would_occur.
