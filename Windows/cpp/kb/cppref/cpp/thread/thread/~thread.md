~thread();

(since C++11)

Destroys the thread object.

If *this has an associated thread (joinable() == true), std::terminate() is called.

### Notes

A thread object does not have an associated thread (and is safe to destroy) after

- it was default-constructed.

- it was moved from.

- join() has been called.

- detach() has been called.

### Example

Run this code

#include <thread>
using namespace std::chrono_literals;
 
int main()
{
auto bleah = std::thread{[]{ std::this_thread::sleep_for(13ms); }};
 
} // ~thread calls std::terminate()

Possible output:

terminate called without an active exception
