thread& operator=( thread&& other ) noexcept;

(since C++11)

If *this still has an associated running thread (i.e. joinable() == true), calls std::terminate(). Otherwise, assigns the state of other to *this and sets other to a default constructed state.

After this call, this->get_id() is equal to the value of other.get_id() prior to the call, and other no longer represents a thread of execution.

### Parameters

other

-

another thread object to assign to this thread object

### Return value

*this
