void join();

(since C++11)

Blocks the current thread until the thread identified by *this finishes its execution.

The completion of the thread identified by *this synchronizes with the corresponding successful return from join(). 

No synchronization is performed on *this itself. Concurrently calling join() on the same thread object from multiple threads constitutes a data race that results in undefined behavior.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

(none)

### Postconditions

joinable() is false.

### Exceptions

std::system_error if an error occurs.

### Error conditions

- resource_deadlock_would_occur if this->get_id() == std::this_thread::get_id() (deadlock detected).

- no_such_process if the thread is not valid.

- invalid_argument if joinable() is false.

### Example

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
 
void foo()
{
// simulate expensive operation
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
}
 
void bar()
{
// simulate expensive operation
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
}
 
int main()
{
std::cout << "starting first helper...\n";
std::thread helper1(foo);
 
std::cout << "starting second helper...\n";
std::thread helper2(bar);
 
std::cout << "waiting for helpers to finish..." << std::endl;
helper1.join();
helper2.join();
 
std::cout << "done!\n";
}

Output:

starting first helper...
starting second helper...
waiting for helpers to finish...
done!
