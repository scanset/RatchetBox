std::thread::id get_id() const noexcept;

(since C++11)

Returns a value of std::thread::id identifying the thread associated with *this.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

A value of type std::thread::id identifying the thread associated with *this. If there is no thread associated, default constructed std::thread::id is returned.

### Example

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
 
void foo()
{
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
}
 
int main()
{
std::thread t1(foo);
std::thread::id t1_id = t1.get_id();
 
std::thread t2(foo);
std::thread::id t2_id = t2.get_id();
 
std::cout << "t1's id: " << t1_id << '\n';
std::cout << "t2's id: " << t2_id << '\n';
 
t1.join();
t2.join();
 
std::cout << "t1's id after join: " << t1.get_id() << '\n';
std::cout << "t2's id after join: " << t2.get_id() << '\n';
}

Possible output:

t1's id: 140146221688576
t2's id: 140146213295872
t1's id after join: thread::id of a non-executing thread
t2's id after join: thread::id of a non-executing thread
