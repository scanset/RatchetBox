Defined in header <thread>

class thread;

(since C++11)

The class thread represents a single thread of execution. Threads allow multiple functions to execute concurrently. 

Threads begin execution immediately upon construction of the associated thread object (pending any OS scheduling delays), starting at the top-level function provided as a constructor argument. The return value of the top-level function is ignored and if it terminates by throwing an exception, std::terminate is called. The top-level function may communicate its return value or an exception to the caller via std::promise or by modifying shared variables (which may require synchronization, see std::mutex and std::atomic).

std::thread objects may also be in the state that does not represent any thread (after default construction, move from, detach, or join), and a thread of execution may not be associated with any thread objects (after detach).

No two std::thread objects may represent the same thread of execution; std::thread is not CopyConstructible or CopyAssignable, although it is MoveConstructible and MoveAssignable.

### Member types

Member type

Definition

native_handle_type (optional*)

implementation-defined

### Member classes

id

represents the id of a thread 
(public member class)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs new thread object 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destructs the thread object, underlying thread must be joined or detached 
(public member function)

operator=

moves the thread object 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

joinable

checks whether the thread is joinable, i.e. potentially running in parallel context 
(public member function)

get_id

returns the id of the thread 
(public member function)

native_handle

returns the underlying implementation-defined thread handle 
(public member function)

hardware_concurrency

[static]

returns the number of concurrent threads supported by the implementation 
(public static member function)

#### Operations 

join

waits for the thread to finish its execution 
(public member function)

detach

permits the thread to execute independently from the thread handle 
(public member function)

swap

swaps two thread objects 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

std::swap(std::thread)

(C++11)

specializes the std::swap algorithm 
(function)
