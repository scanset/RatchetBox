Defined in header <mutex>

class mutex;

(since C++11)

The mutex class is a synchronization primitive that can be used to protect shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads.

mutex offers exclusive, non-recursive ownership semantics:

- A calling thread owns a mutex from the time that it successfully calls either lock or try_lock until it calls unlock.

- When a thread owns a mutex, all other threads will block (for calls to lock) or receive a false return value (for try_lock) if they attempt to claim ownership of the mutex.

- A calling thread must not own the mutex prior to calling lock or try_lock.

The behavior of a program is undefined if a mutex is destroyed while still owned by any threads, or a thread terminates while owning a mutex. The mutex class satisfies all requirements of Mutex and StandardLayoutType.

std::mutex is neither copyable nor movable.

### Nested types

Name

Definition

native_handle_type (optional*)

implementation-defined

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs the mutex 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destroys the mutex 
(public member function)

operator=

[deleted]

not copy-assignable 
(public member function)

#### Locking 

lock

locks the mutex, blocks if the mutex is not available 
(public member function)

try_lock

tries to lock the mutex, returns if the mutex is not available 
(public member function)

unlock

unlocks the mutex 
(public member function)

#### Native handle 

native_handle

returns the underlying implementation-defined native handle object 
(public member function)

### Notes

std::mutex is usually not accessed directly: std::unique_lock, std::lock_guard, or std::scoped_lock(since C++17) manage locking in a more exception-safe manner.

### Example

This example shows how a mutex can be used to protect an std::map shared between two threads.

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <mutex>
#include <string>
#include <thread>
 
std::map<std::string, std::string> g_pages;
std::mutex g_pages_mutex;
 
void save_page(const std::string& url)
{
// simulate a long page fetch
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));
std::string result = "fake content";
 
std::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard(g_pages_mutex);
g_pages[url] = result;
}
 
int main() 
{
std::thread t1(save_page, "http://foo");
std::thread t2(save_page, "http://bar");
t1.join();
t2.join();
 
// safe to access g_pages without lock now, as the threads are joined
for (const auto& [url, page] : g_pages)
std::cout << url << " => " << page << '\n';
}

Output:

http://bar => fake content
http://foo => fake content
