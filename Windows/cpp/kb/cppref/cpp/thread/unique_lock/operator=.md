unique_lock& operator=( unique_lock&& other );

(since C++11)

Move assignment operator. Replaces the contents with those of other using move semantics. 

If prior to the call *this has an associated mutex and has acquired ownership of it, the mutex is unlocked. 

### Parameters

other

-

another unique_lock to replace the state with

### Return value

*this

### Exceptions

Throws nothing.

### Notes

With a recursive mutex it is possible for both *this and other to own the same mutex before the assignment. In this case, *this will own the mutex after the assignment and other will not.

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

C++11

the move assignment operator was noexcept, but it may
throw an exception in the case of undefined behavior[1]

it is not noexcept

- ↑ For example, *this is constructed with std::adopt_lock, but the calling thread does not have the ownership of the associated mutex. In this case, *this cannot properly release the ownership of the associated mutex, and it may result in an exception to be thrown.
