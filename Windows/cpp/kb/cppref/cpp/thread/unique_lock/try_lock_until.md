template< class Clock, class Duration >

bool try_lock_until( const std::chrono::time_point<Clock, Duration>& timeout_time );

(since C++11)

Tries to lock (i.e., takes ownership of) the associated mutex. Blocks until specified timeout_time has been reached or the lock is acquired, whichever comes first. On successful lock acquisition returns true, otherwise returns false. May block for longer than timeout_time until has been reached.

Effectively calls mutex()->try_lock_until(timeout_time).

std::system_error is thrown if there is no associated mutex or if the mutex is already locked by the same thread.

Clock must meet the Clock requirements. The program is ill-formed if std::chrono::is_clock_v<Clock> is false.(since C++20)

### Parameters

timeout_time

-

maximum time point to block until

### Return value

true if the ownership of the mutex has been acquired successfully, false otherwise.

### Exceptions

- Any exceptions thrown by mutex()->try_lock_until(timeout_time).

- If there is no associated mutex, std::system_error with an error code of std::errc::operation_not_permitted.

- If the mutex is already locked, std::system_error with an error code of std::errc::resource_deadlock_would_occur.
