bool try_lock();

(since C++11)

Tries to lock (i.e., takes ownership of) the associated mutex without blocking. Effectively calls mutex()->try_lock().

std::system_error is thrown if there is no associated mutex or if the mutex is already locked by this std::unique_lock.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if the ownership of the mutex has been acquired successfully, false otherwise.

### Exceptions

- Any exceptions thrown by mutex()->try_lock() (Mutex types do not throw in try_lock, but a custom Lockable might).

- If there is no associated mutex, std::system_error with an error code of std::errc::operation_not_permitted.

- If the mutex is already locked by this std::unique_lock, std::system_error with an error code of std::errc::resource_deadlock_would_occur.

### Example

The following examples try to acquire a mutex that was locked and unlocked.

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>
 
using namespace std::chrono_literals;
 
int main()
{
std::mutex counter_mutex;
std::vector<std::thread> threads;
using Id = int;
 
auto worker_task = [&](Id id, std::chrono::seconds wait, std::chrono::seconds acquire)
{
// wait for a few seconds before acquiring lock.
std::this_thread::sleep_for(wait);
 
std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(counter_mutex, std::defer_lock);
if (lock.try_lock())
std::cout << '#' << id << ", lock acquired.\n";
else
{
std::cout << '#' << id << ", failed acquiring lock.\n";
return;
}
 
// keep the lock for a while.
std::this_thread::sleep_for(acquire);
 
std::cout << '#' << id << ", releasing lock (via destructor).\n";
};
 
threads.emplace_back(worker_task, Id{0}, 0s, 2s);
threads.emplace_back(worker_task, Id{1}, 1s, 0s);
threads.emplace_back(worker_task, Id{2}, 3s, 0s);
 
for (auto& thread : threads)
thread.join();
}

Output:

#0, lock acquired.
#1, failed acquiring lock.
#0, releasing lock (via destructor).
#2, lock acquired.
#2, releasing lock (via destructor).
