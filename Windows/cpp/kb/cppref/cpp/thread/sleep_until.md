Defined in header <thread>

template< class Clock, class Duration >

void sleep_until( const std::chrono::time_point<Clock, Duration>& sleep_time );

(since C++11)

Blocks the execution of the current thread until specified sleep_time has been reached. 

Clock must meet the Clock requirements. The program is ill-formed if std::chrono::is_clock_v<Clock> is false.(since C++20)

The standard recommends that the clock tied to sleep_time be used, in which case adjustments of the clock may be taken into account. Thus, the duration of the block might be more or less than sleep_time - Clock::now() at the time of the call, depending on the direction of the adjustment and whether it is honored by the implementation. The function also may block until after sleep_time has been reached due to process scheduling or resource contention delays.

### Parameters

sleep_time

-

time to block until

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown by Clock or Duration (clocks and durations provided by the standard library never throw).

### Example

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
 
auto now() { return std::chrono::steady_clock::now(); }
 
auto awake_time()
{
using std::chrono::operator""ms;
return now() + 2000ms;
}
 
int main()
{
std::cout << "Hello, waiter...\n" << std::flush;
const auto start{now()};
std::this_thread::sleep_until(awake_time());
std::chrono::duration<double, std::milli> elapsed{now() - start};
std::cout << "Waited " << elapsed.count() << " ms\n";
}

Possible output:

Hello, waiter...
Waited 2000.17 ms
