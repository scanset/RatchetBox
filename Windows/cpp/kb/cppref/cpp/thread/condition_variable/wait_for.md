template< class Rep, class Period >

std::cv_status wait_for( std::unique_lock<std::mutex>& lock,

const std::chrono::duration<Rep, Period>& rel_time );

(1)
(since C++11)

template< class Rep, class Period, class Predicate >

bool wait_for( std::unique_lock<std::mutex>& lock,

               const std::chrono::duration<Rep, Period>& rel_time,

Predicate pred );

(2)
(since C++11)

wait_for causes the current thread to block until the condition variable is notified, the given duration has been elapsed, or a spurious wakeup occurs. pred can be optionally provided to detect spurious wakeup.

1) Equivalent to return wait_until(lock, std::chrono::steady_clock::now() + rel_time);.

2) Equivalent to return wait_until(lock, std::chrono::steady_clock::now() + rel_time, std::move(pred));.

This overload may be used to ignore spurious awakenings while waiting for a specific condition to become true.

Right after wait_for returns, lock.owns_lock() is true, and lock.mutex() is locked by the calling thread. If these postconditions cannot be satisfied[1], calls std::terminate.

If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined:

- lock.owns_lock() is false.

- lock.mutex() is not locked by the calling thread.

- If some other threads are also waiting on *this, lock.mutex() is different from the mutex unlocked by the waiting functions (wait, wait_for and wait_until) called on *this by those threads.

- ↑ This can happen if the re-locking of the mutex throws an exception.

### Parameters

lock

-

a lock which must be locked by the calling thread

rel_time

-

the maximum duration to wait

pred

-

the predicate to check whether the waiting can be completed

Type requirements

-

Predicate must meet the requirements of FunctionObject.

-

pred() must be a valid expression, and its type and value category must meet the BooleanTestable requirements.

### Return value

1) std::cv_status::timeout if rel_time has been elapsed since the beginning of this call, otherwise std::cv_status::no_timeout.

2) The latest result of pred() before returning to the caller.

### Exceptions

1) Timeout-related exceptions.

2) Timeout-related exceptions, and any exception thrown by pred.

### Notes

Even if notified under lock, overload (1) makes no guarantees about the state of the associated predicate when returning due to timeout.

The effects of notify_one()/notify_all() and each of the three atomic parts of wait()/wait_for()/wait_until() (unlock+wait, wakeup, and lock) take place in a single total order that can be viewed as modification order of an atomic variable: the order is specific to this individual condition variable. This makes it impossible for notify_one() to, for example, be delayed and unblock a thread that started waiting just after the call to notify_one() was made.

### Example

Run this code

#include <chrono>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
 
std::condition_variable cv;
std::mutex cv_m; // This mutex is used for three purposes:
// 1) to synchronize accesses to i
// 2) to synchronize accesses to std::cerr
// 3) for the condition variable cv
int i = 0;
 
void waits()
{
std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(cv_m);
std::cerr << "Waiting... \n";
cv.wait(lk, []{ return i == 1; });
std::cerr << "...finished waiting. i == 1\n";
}
 
void signals()
{
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
{
std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(cv_m);
std::cerr << "Notifying...\n";
}
cv.notify_all();
 
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
 
{
std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(cv_m);
i = 1;
std::cerr << "Notifying again...\n";
}
cv.notify_all();
}
 
int main()
{
std::thread t1(waits), t2(waits), t3(waits), t4(signals);
t1.join(); 
t2.join(); 
t3.join();
t4.join();
}

Possible output:

Waiting...
Waiting...
Waiting...
Notifying...
Notifying again...
...finished waiting. i == 1
...finished waiting. i == 1
...finished waiting. i == 1
