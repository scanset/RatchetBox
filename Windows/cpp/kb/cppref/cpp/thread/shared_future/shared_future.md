Constructs a new shared_future.

1) Default constructor. Constructs an empty shared future, that doesn't refer to a shared state, that is valid() == false.

2) Constructs a shared future that refers to the same shared state, if any, as other.

3,4) Transfers the shared state held by other to *this. After the construction, other.valid() == false, and this->valid() returns the same value as other.valid() would have returned before the construction.

### Parameters

other

-

another future object to initialize with
