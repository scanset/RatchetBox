template< class Clock, class Duration >

std::future_status wait_until( const std::chrono::time_point<Clock,Duration>& timeout_time ) const;

(since C++11)

wait_until waits for a result to become available. It blocks until specified timeout_time has been reached or the result becomes available, whichever comes first. The return value indicates why wait_until returned.

If the future is the result of a call to async that used lazy evaluation, this function returns immediately without waiting.

The behavior is undefined if valid() is false before the call to this function, or Clock does not meet the Clock requirements. The programs is ill-formed if std::chrono::is_clock_v<Clock> is false.(since C++20)

### Parameters

timeout_time

-

maximum time point to block until

### Return value

Constant

Explanation

future_status::deferred

The shared state contains a deferred function using lazy evaluation, so the result will be computed only when explicitly requested

future_status::ready

The result is ready

future_status::timeout

The timeout has expired

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown by clock, time_point, or duration during the execution (clocks, time points, and durations provided by the standard library never throw).

### Notes

The implementations are encouraged to detect the case when valid() == false before the call and throw a std::future_error with an error condition of future_errc::no_state.

The standard recommends that the clock tied to timeout_time be used to measure time; that clock is not required to be a monotonic clock. There are no guarantees regarding the behavior of this function if the clock is adjusted discontinuously, but the existing implementations convert timeout_time from Clock to std::chrono::system_clock and delegate to POSIX pthread_cond_timedwait so that the wait honors adjustments to the system clock, but not to the user-provided Clock. In any case, the function also may wait for longer than until after timeout_time has been reached due to scheduling or resource contention delays.
