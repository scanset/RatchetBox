Defined in header <mutex>

template< class Mutex >

class unique_lock;

(since C++11)

The class unique_lock is a general-purpose mutex ownership wrapper allowing deferred locking, time-constrained attempts at locking, recursive locking, transfer of lock ownership, and use with condition variables. 

The class unique_lock is movable, but not copyable -- it meets the requirements of MoveConstructible and MoveAssignable but not of CopyConstructible or CopyAssignable.

The class unique_lock meets the BasicLockable requirements. If Mutex meets the Lockable requirements, unique_lock also meets the Lockable requirements (ex.: can be used in std::lock); if Mutex meets the TimedLockable requirements, unique_lock also meets the TimedLockable requirements.

### Template parameters

-

the type of the mutex to lock. The type must meet the BasicLockable requirements

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a unique_lock, optionally locking (i.e., taking ownership of) the supplied mutex 
(public member function)

(destructor)

unlocks (i.e., releases ownership of) the associated mutex, if owned 
(public member function)

operator=

unlocks (i.e., releases ownership of) the mutex, if owned, and acquires ownership of another 
(public member function)

#### Locking 

lock

locks (i.e., takes ownership of) the associated mutex 
(public member function)

try_lock

tries to lock (i.e., takes ownership of) the associated mutex without blocking 
(public member function)

try_lock_for

attempts to lock (i.e., takes ownership of) the associated TimedLockable mutex, returns if the mutex has been unavailable for the specified time duration 
(public member function)

try_lock_until

tries to lock (i.e., takes ownership of) the associated TimedLockable mutex, returns if the mutex has been unavailable until specified time point has been reached 
(public member function)

unlock

unlocks (i.e., releases ownership of) the associated mutex 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

swap

swaps state with another std::unique_lock 
(public member function)

release

disassociates the associated mutex without unlocking (i.e., releasing ownership of) it 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

mutex

returns a pointer to the associated mutex 
(public member function)

owns_lock

tests whether the lock owns (i.e., has locked) its associated mutex 
(public member function)

operator bool

tests whether the lock owns (i.e., has locked) its associated mutex 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

std::swap(std::unique_lock)

(C++11)

specializes the std::swap algorithm 
(function template)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
 
struct Box
{
explicit Box(int num) : num_things{num} {}
 
int num_things;
std::mutex m;
};
 
void transfer(Box& from, Box& to, int num)
{
// don't actually take the locks yet
std::unique_lock lock1{from.m, std::defer_lock};
std::unique_lock lock2{to.m, std::defer_lock};
 
// lock both unique_locks without deadlock
std::lock(lock1, lock2);
 
from.num_things -= num;
to.num_things += num;
 
// “from.m” and “to.m” mutexes unlocked in unique_lock dtors
}
 
int main()
{
Box acc1{100};
Box acc2{50};
 
std::thread t1{transfer, std::ref(acc1), std::ref(acc2), 10};
std::thread t2{transfer, std::ref(acc2), std::ref(acc1), 5};
 
t1.join();
t2.join();
 
std::cout << "acc1: " << acc1.num_things << "\n"
"acc2: " << acc2.num_things << '\n';
}

Output:

acc1: 95
acc2: 55
