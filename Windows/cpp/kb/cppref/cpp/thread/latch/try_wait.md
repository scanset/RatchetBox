bool try_wait() const noexcept;

(since C++20)

Returns true only if the internal counter has reached zero. This function may spuriously return false with very low probability even if the internal counter has reached zero.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

With very low probability false, otherwise cnt == 0, where cnt is the value of the internal counter.

### Notes

The reason why a spurious result is permitted is to allow implementations to use a memory order more relaxed than std::memory_order_seq_cst.
