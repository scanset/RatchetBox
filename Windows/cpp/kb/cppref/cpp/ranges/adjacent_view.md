1) adjacent_view is a range adaptor that takes a view, and produces a view whose ith element (a "window") is a std::tuple that holds N references to the elements of the original view, from ith up to i + N - 1th inclusively.

Let S be the size of the original view. Then the size of produced view is:

- S - N + 1, if S >= N,

- ​0​ otherwise, and the resulting view is empty.

2) The name views::adjacent<N> denotes a RangeAdaptorObject. Given a subexpression e and a constant expression N, the expression views::adjacent<N>(e) is expression-equivalent to

- ((void)e, auto(views::empty<tuple<>>)) if N is equal to ​0​ and decltype((e)) models forward_range,

- adjacent_view<views::all_t<decltype((e))>, N>(e) otherwise.

3) The name views::pairwise denotes a RangeAdaptorObject that behaves exactly as views::adjacent<2>.

adjacent_view always models forward_range, and models bidirectional_range, random_access_range, or sized_range if adapted view type models the corresponding concept.

### Data members

Member name

Definition

base_ (private)

the underlying view of type V.
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a adjacent_view 
(public member function)

begin

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

end

returns an iterator or a sentinel to the end 
(public member function)

size

returns the number of elements. Provided only if the underlying (adapted) range satisfies sized_range. 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

back

returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies bidirectional_range and common_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator[]

returns the nth element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies random_access_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Deduction guides

(none)

### Nested classes

iterator

the iterator type
(exposition-only member class template*)

sentinel

the sentinel type used when adjacent_view is not a common_range
(exposition-only member class template*)

### Helper templates

template< class V, size_t N >

constexpr bool ranges::enable_borrowed_range<adjacent_view<V, N>> =

ranges::enable_borrowed_range<V>;

(since C++23)

This specialization of ranges::enable_borrowed_range makes adjacent_view satisfy borrowed_range when the underlying view satisfies it.

### Notes

views::adjacent only accepts forward ranges even when N is 0.

There are similarities between ranges::adjacent_view and ranges::slide_view:

- Both create a "sliding window" of size N.

- Both have the same size S - N + 1, where S is the size of an adapted view such that S >= N > 0.

The following table shows the differences between these adaptors:

The window size N

ranges::adjacent_view
std::tuple
A template parameter

ranges::slide_view
ranges::range
A runtime argument

### Example

Run this code

#include <array>
#include <format>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <tuple>
 
int main()
{
constexpr std::array v{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
std::cout << "v = [1 2 3 4 5 6]\n";
 
for (int i{}; std::tuple t : v | std::views::adjacent<3>)
{
auto [t0, t1, t2] = t;
std::cout << std::format("e = {:<{}}[{} {} {}]\n", "", 2 * i++, t0, t1, t2);
}
}

Output:

v = [1 2 3 4 5 6]
e = [1 2 3]
e = [2 3 4]
e = [3 4 5]
e = [4 5 6]
