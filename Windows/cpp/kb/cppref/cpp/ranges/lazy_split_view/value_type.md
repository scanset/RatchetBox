struct value_type : ranges::view_interface<value_type>

(since C++20)

The value type of the iterator ranges::lazy_split_view<V, Pattern>::outer_iterator<Const>.

### Data members

Member

Description

outer_iterator i_ (private)

an iterator into underlying view of the outer class
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a value_type object
(exposition-only member function*)

begin

returns an inner_iterator to the beginning of the inner range 
(public member function)

end

returns a std::default_sentinel 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Member functions

## std::ranges::lazy_split_view::outer_iterator::value_type::value_type

constexpr explicit value_type(/*outer_iterator*/ i); // exposition only

(since C++20)

Initializes i_ with std::move(i).

## std::ranges::lazy_split_view::outer_iterator::value_type::begin

constexpr /*inner_iterator*/<Const> begin() const;

(since C++20)

Equivalent to return /*inner_iterator*/<Const>{i_};.

## std::ranges::lazy_split_view::outer_iterator::value_type::end

constexpr std::default_sentinel_t end() const noexcept;

(since C++20)

Returns std::default_sentinel.
