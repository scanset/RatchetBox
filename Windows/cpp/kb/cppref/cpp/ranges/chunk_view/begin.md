V models only input_range

constexpr __outer_iterator begin();

(1)
(since C++23)

V models forward_range

constexpr auto begin() requires (!__simple_view<V>);

(2)
(since C++23)

constexpr auto begin() const requires ranges::forward_range<const V>;

(3)
(since C++23)

Returns an iterator to the first element of the chunk_view.

Let base_ denote the underlying view.

1) Available only if V models input_range. Equivalent to:
current_ = ranges::begin(base_);
remainder_ = n_;
return __outer_iterator(*this);

current_, remainder_, and n_ are underlying exposition only data members of chunk_view.

2) Available if V models forward_range. Equivalent to: return iterator<false>(this, ranges::begin(base_));, where iterator is exposition only nested class.

3) Available if V models forward_range. Equivalent to: return iterator<true>(this, ranges::begin(base_));, where iterator is exposition only nested class.
