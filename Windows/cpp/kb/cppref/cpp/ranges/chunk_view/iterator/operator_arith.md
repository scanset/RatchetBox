Advances or decrements the iterator.

Let current_, end_, and n_ be the underlying data members of chunk_view::iterator.

1) Equivalent to:
missing_ = ranges::advance(current_, n_, end_);
return *this;

Before the invocation the expression current_ != end_ must be true, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

2) Equivalent to: auto tmp = *this; ++*this; return tmp;.

3) Equivalent to:
ranges::advance(current_, missing_ - n_);
missing_ = 0;
return *this;

4) Equivalent to: auto tmp = *this; --*this; return tmp;.

5) Equivalent to:
if (x > 0)
{
ranges::advance(current_, n_ * (x - 1));
missing_ = ranges::advance(current_, n_, end_);
}
else if (x < 0)
{
ranges::advance(current_, n_ * x + missing_);
missing_ = 0;
}
return *this;

If x is positive, then before the invocation the expression ranges::distance(current_, end_) > n_ * (x - 1) must be true (i.e., informally, the requested chunk should be "inside" the underlying sequence). If x is negative, this precondition is always met.

6) Equivalent to: return *this += -x;.

### Parameters

x

-

a position relative to current location

### Return value

2,4) a copy of *this that was made before the change
