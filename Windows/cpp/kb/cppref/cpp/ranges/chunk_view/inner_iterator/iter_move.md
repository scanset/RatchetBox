friend constexpr auto iter_move( const /*inner-iterator*/& i ) noexcept(/* see below */)

(since C++23)

Returns the result of applying ranges::iter_move to the stored inner iterator.

Let parent_ be the underlying pointer to the enclosing chunk_view, and *i.parent_->current_ denote the cached underlying iterator of type ranges::iterator_t<V>.

Equivalent to: return ranges::iter_move(*i.parent_->current_);.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when chunk_view::inner-iterator is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

i

-

iterator

### Return value

The result of applying ranges::iter_move to the stored iterator of type ranges::iterator_t<V>.

### Exceptions

noexcept specification:  
noexcept(noexcept(ranges::iter_move(*i.parent_->current_)))
