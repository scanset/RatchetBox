friend constexpr bool operator==( const /*inner-iterator*/& x,

                                  std::default_sentinel_t );

(since C++23)

Compares the iterator and the sentinel.

Let parent_ be the underlying pointer to enclosing chunk_view.

Equivalent to: returns x.parent_->remainder_ == 0;

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::ranges::chunk_view::inner-iterator is an associated class of the arguments.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

### Parameters

x

-

iterator to compare

### Return value

The result of comparison.
