2) If [i, s) is not a valid range, the behavior is undefined.

3) If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined:

- [i, s) is not a valid range.

- n == to-unsigned-like ﻿(ranges::distance(i, s)) is false.

### Parameters

i

-

iterator that denotes the beginning of the range

s

-

sentinel that denotes the end of the range

r

-

range

n

-

size hint, must be equal to the size of the range

for overload (4), size_ might be initialized with ranges::size(r), but it is
not always implicitly convertible to the corresponding unsigned-integer-like type

made the
conversion explicit
