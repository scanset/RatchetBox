Helper templates

1) stride_view is a range adaptor that takes a view and a number n and produces a view, that consists of elements of the original view by advancing over n elements at a time. This means that each mth element of the produced view is (n * i)th element of the original view, for some non-negative index i.
The elements of the original view, whose "index" is not a multiple of n, are not present in the produced view.

Let S be the size of the original view. Then the size of produced view is:

- (S / n) + (S % n ? 1 : 0), if S >= n; otherwise,

- 1, if S > 0; otherwise,

- ​0​, and the resulting view is empty.

2) The name views::stride denotes a RangeAdaptorObject. Given subexpressions e and n, the expression views::stride(e, n) is expression-equivalent to stride_view(e, n).

The n must be greater than ​0​, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

stride_view always models input_range, and models forward_range, bidirectional_range, random_access_range, and/or sized_range, if adapted view type V models the corresponding concept.
stride_view<V> models common_range whenever the underlying view V does.

### Data members

Member object

Definition

base_ (private)

The underlying view of type V.
(exposition-only member object*)

stride_ (private)

The size object (the "stride") of type ranges::range_difference_t<V>.
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a stride_view 
(public member function)

stride

(C++23)

returns the stored stride value 
(public member function)

base

returns a copy of the underlying (adapted) view 
(public member function)

begin

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

end

returns an iterator or a sentinel to the end 
(public member function)

size

returns the number of elements. Provided only if the underlying (adapted) range satisfies sized_range. 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

back

returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies bidirectional_range and common_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator[]

returns the nth element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies random_access_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Deduction guides

### Nested classes

iterator

(C++23)

the iterator type
(exposition-only member class template*)

### Helper templates

template< class V >

constexpr bool ranges::enable_borrowed_range<stride_view<V>> =

ranges::enable_borrowed_range<V>;

(since C++23)

This specialization of ranges::enable_borrowed_range makes stride_view satisfy borrowed_range when the underlying view satisfies it.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <string_view>
using namespace std::literals;
 
void print(std::ranges::viewable_range auto&& v, std::string_view separator = " ")
{
for (auto const& x : v)
std::cout << x << separator;
std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
print(std::views::iota(1, 13) | std::views::stride(3));
print(std::views::iota(1, 13) | std::views::stride(3) | std::views::reverse);
print(std::views::iota(1, 13) | std::views::reverse | std::views::stride(3));
 
print("0x0!133713337*x//42/A$@"sv | std::views::stride(0B11)
std::views::transform([](char O) -> char { return 0100 | O; }),
"");
}

Output:

1 4 7 10
10 7 4 1
12 9 6 3
