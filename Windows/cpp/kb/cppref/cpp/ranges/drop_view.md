1) A range adaptor consisting of elements of the underlying sequence, skipping the first N elements.

2) RangeAdaptorObject. Given T is std::remove_cvref_t<decltype((e))> and D is ranges::range_difference_t<decltype((e))>), the expression views::drop(e, f) is expression-equivalent to:

- ((void)f, decay-copy(e)), if T is a ranges::empty_view, except that the evaluations of e and f are indeterminately sequenced;

- otherwise, T(ranges::begin(e) + inc, ranges::end(e),
    /*to-unsigned-like*/(ranges::distance(e) - inc)), if T is a specialization of ranges::subrange that models both random_access_range and sized_range, and T needs to store the size (see ranges::subrange::subrange() for details), where inc is std::min<D>(ranges::distance(e), f);

- otherwise, U(ranges::begin(e) + inc, ranges::end(e)), if T is a specialization of std::span, std::basic_string_view, ranges::iota_view, or ranges::subrange that models both random_access_range and sized_range, where U is

- std::span<typename T::element_type>, if T is a specialization of std::span;

- T otherwise;

- otherwise, if T is a specialization of ranges::repeat_view:

- views::repeat(*e.value_, ranges::distance(e) - inc), if T models sized_range; in such case e is evaluated only once;

- ((void)e, auto(f)) otherwise, except that the evaluations of e and f are indeterminately sequenced;

(since C++23)

- otherwise, drop_view(e, f).

In all cases, decltype((f)) must model std::convertible_to<D>.

drop_view models the concepts contiguous_range, random_access_range, bidirectional_range, forward_range, input_range, common_range, and sized_range when the underlying view V models respective concepts.

### Data members

Member name

Definition

base_ (private)

the underlying (adapted) view of type V
(exposition-only member object*)

count_ (private)

the number of elements to skip, of type ranges::range_difference_t<V>
(exposition-only member object*)

cache_ (private) 
(conditionally present)

TODO: mention L4$ 
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a drop_view 
(public member function)

base

returns a copy of the underlying (adapted) view 
(public member function)

begin

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

end

returns an iterator or a sentinel to the end 
(public member function)

size

returns the number of elements. Provided only if the underlying (adapted) range satisfies sized_range. 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

data

gets the address of derived view's data. Provided if its iterator type satisfies contiguous_iterator. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

back

returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies bidirectional_range and common_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator[]

returns the nth element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies random_access_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Deduction guides

### Helper templates

template< class T >

constexpr bool enable_borrowed_range<std::ranges::drop_view<T>> =

ranges::enable_borrowed_range<T>;

(since C++20)

This specialization of ranges::enable_borrowed_range makes drop_view satisfy borrowed_range when the underlying view satisfies it.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
const auto nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
 
std::cout << "drop " << 2 << ": ";
for (int i : std::ranges::drop_view{nums, 2})
std::cout << i << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
 
std::cout << "drop " << 3 << ": ";
for (int i : nums | std::views::drop(3))
std::cout << i << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
 
std::cout << "drop " << 4 << ": ";
for (int i : std::views::iota(1, 8) | std::views::drop(4))
std::cout << i << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
 
// Note that dropping more than the number of elements is OK:
for (int dp : {5, 6, 7, 890, 100500})
{
std::cout << "drop " << dp << ": ";
for (int i : std::views::iota(1, 8) | std::views::drop(dp))
std::cout << i << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}
}

Output:

drop 2: 3 4 5 6 7
drop 3: 4 5 6 7
drop 4: 5 6 7
drop 5: 6 7
drop 6: 7
drop 7:
drop 890: 
drop 100500:

LWG 3407

C++20

views::drop sometimes fails to
construct a sized random access range

the construction is adjusted
so that it is always valid

LWG 3494

C++20

drop_view was never a borrowed_range

it is a borrowed_range if its underlying view is
