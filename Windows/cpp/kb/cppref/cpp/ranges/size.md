constexpr auto size( T&& t );

(since C++20)

Calculates the number of elements in t in constant time.

Given the subexpression of which t denotes the (possibly materialized) result object as E, and the type of E as T:

- If T is an array of unknown bound, ranges::size(E) is ill-formed.

- Otherwise, if T is an array type, ranges::size(E) is expression-equivalent to decay-copy ﻿(std::extent_v<T>)(until C++23)auto(std::extent_v<T>)(since C++23).

- Otherwise, if all following conditions are satisfied, ranges::size(E) is expression-equivalent to decay-copy ﻿(t.size())(until C++23)auto(t.size())(since C++23):
ranges::disable_sized_range<std::remove_cv_t<T>> is false.

- decay-copy ﻿(t.size())(until C++23)auto(t.size())(since C++23) is a valid expression of integer-like type.

- Otherwise, if all following conditions are satisfied, ranges::size(E) is expression-equivalent to decay-copy ﻿(size(t))(until C++23)auto(size(t))(since C++23):
T is a class or enumeration type.

- ranges::disable_sized_range<std::remove_cv_t<T>> is false.

- decay-copy ﻿(size(t))(until C++23)auto(size(t))(since C++23) is a valid expression of integer-like type, where the meaning of size is established as if by performing argument-dependent lookup only.

- Otherwise, if all following conditions are satisfied, ranges::size(E) is expression-equivalent to to-unsigned-like ﻿(ranges::end(t) - ranges::begin(t)):
T models forward_range.

- Given the type of ranges::begin(t) as I and the type of ranges::end(t) as S, both sized_sentinel_for<S, I> and forward_iterator<I> are modeled.

- to-unsigned-like ﻿(ranges::end(t) - ranges::begin(t)) is a valid expression.

- Otherwise, ranges::size(E) is ill-formed.

Diagnosable ill-formed cases above result in substitution failure when ranges::size(E) appears in the immediate context of a template instantiation.

### Customization point objects

The name ranges::size denotes a customization point object, which is a const function object of a literal semiregular class type. For exposition purposes, the cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted as __size_fn.

All instances of __size_fn are equal. The effects of invoking different instances of type __size_fn on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be invocable). Thus, ranges::size can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to ranges::size above, __size_fn models

- std::invocable<__size_fn, Args...>,

- std::invocable<const __size_fn, Args...>,

- std::invocable<__size_fn&, Args...>, and

- std::invocable<const __size_fn&, Args...>.

Otherwise, no function call operator of __size_fn participates in overload resolution.

### Notes

Whenever ranges::size(e) is valid for an expression e, the return type is integer-like.

The C++20 standard requires that if the underlying size function call returns a prvalue, the return value is move-constructed from the materialized temporary object. All implementations directly return the prvalue instead. The requirement is corrected by the post-C++20 proposal P0849R8 to match the implementations.

The expression ranges::distance(e) can also be used to determine the size of a range e. Unlike ranges::size(e), ranges::distance(e) works even if e is an unsized range, at the cost of having linear complexity in that case.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <type_traits>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
auto v = std::vector<int>{};
std::cout << "ranges::size(v) == " << std::ranges::size(v) << '\n';
 
auto il = {7}; // std::initializer_list
std::cout << "ranges::size(il) == " << std::ranges::size(il) << '\n';
 
int array[]{4, 5}; // array has a known bound
std::cout << "ranges::size(array) == " << std::ranges::size(array) << '\n';
 
static_assert(std::is_signed_v<decltype(std::ranges::size(v))> == false);
}

Output:

ranges::size(v) == 0
ranges::size(il) == 1
ranges::size(array) == 2
