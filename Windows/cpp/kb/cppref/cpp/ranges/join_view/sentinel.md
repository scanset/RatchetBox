template< bool Const >

class /*sentinel*/

(since C++20) 
(exposition only*)

The return type of join_view::end when either of the underlying ranges (V or ranges::range_reference_t<V>) is not a common_range, or when the parent join_view is not a forward_range.

If V is not a simple view, Const is true for sentinels returned from the const overloads, and false otherwise. If V is a simple view, Const is true.
