friend constexpr void iter_swap( const /*iterator*/& x, const /*iterator*/& y )

    noexcept( /*see below*/ )

requires std::indirectly_swappable<InnerIter>;

(since C++20)

Swaps the objects pointed to by two underlying iterators (denoted as inner_).

Equivalent to: ranges::iter_swap(x.inner_, y.inner_);.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when join_view::iterator<Const> is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

x, y

-

iterators

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

noexcept specification:  
noexcept(noexcept(ranges::iter_swap(x.inner_, y.inner_)))
