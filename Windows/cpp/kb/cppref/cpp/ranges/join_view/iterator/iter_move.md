friend constexpr decltype(auto) iter_move( const /*iterator*/& i )

    noexcept( /*see below*/ );

(since C++20)

Casts the result of dereferencing the underlying iterator i.inner_ to its associated rvalue reference type.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when join_view::iterator<Const> is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

i

iterator

### Return value

Equivalent to: ranges::iter_move(i.inner_).

### Exceptions
