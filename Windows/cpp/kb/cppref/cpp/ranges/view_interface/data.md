constexpr auto data()

    requires std::contiguous_iterator<ranges::iterator_t<D>>;

(1)
(since C++20)

constexpr auto data() const

    requires ranges::range<const D> && 

std::contiguous_iterator<ranges::iterator_t<const D>>;

(2)
(since C++20)

The default implementation of data() member function obtains the address denoted by the beginning iterator via std::to_address, which is also the lowest address of the contiguous storage (implied by contiguous_iterator) referenced by the view of the derived type when the view is not empty.

1) Let derived be static_cast<D&>(*this). Equivalent to return std::to_address(ranges::begin(derived));.

2) Same as (1), except that derived is static_cast<const D&>(*this).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The address denoted by the beginning iterator.

### Notes

Following derived types may use the default implementation of data():

- std::ranges::common_view

- std::ranges::drop_view

- std::ranges::drop_while_view

- std::ranges::ref_view

- std::ranges::subrange

- std::ranges::take_view

- std::ranges::take_while_view

Following types are derived from std::ranges::view_interface and do not declare their own data() member function, but they cannot use the default implementation, because their iterator types never satisfy contiguous_iterator:

- std::ranges::basic_istream_view

- std::ranges::elements_view

- std::ranges::filter_view

- std::ranges::iota_view

- std::ranges::join_view

- std::ranges::lazy_split_view

- std::ranges::reverse_view

- std::ranges::split_view

- std::ranges::transform_view

### Example

Run this code

#include <array>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <string_view>
 
int main() {
constexpr std::string_view str { "Hello, C++20!" };
std::cout << (str | std::views::drop(7)).data() << '\n';
constexpr static std::array a { 1,2,3,4,5 };
constexpr auto v { a | std::views::take(3) };
static_assert( &a[0] == v.data() );
}

Output:

C++20!
