constexpr explicit operator bool() requires /* see below */;

(1)
(since C++20)

constexpr explicit operator bool() const requires /* see below */;

(2)
(since C++20)

The default implementation of operator bool member function checks whether the view is non-empty. It makes the derived type contextually convertible to bool.

1) Let derived be static_cast<D&>(*this). The expression in the requires-clause is equal to requires { ranges::empty(derived); }, and the function body is equivalent to return !ranges::empty(derived);.

2) Same as (1), except that derived is static_cast<const D&>(*this).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

false if the value of the derived type is empty (determined by std::ranges::empty), true otherwise.

### Notes

In C++20, no type derived from std::ranges::view_interface in the standard library provides their own operator bool. Almost all of these types use the default implementation.

A notable exception is std::ranges::basic_istream_view. For its iterator type never satisfies forward_iterator, the view cannot use the inherited operator bool.

### Example

Run this code

#include <array>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
const std::array ints {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
auto odds = ints | std::views::filter([](int i) { return 0 != i % 2; });
auto negs = ints | std::views::filter([](int i) { return i < 0; });
std::cout << std::boolalpha
<< "Has odd numbers: " << (!!odds) << ' ' << '\n'
<< "Has negative numbers: " << (!!negs) << ' ' << '\n';
}

Output:

Has odd numbers: true
Has negative numbers: false
