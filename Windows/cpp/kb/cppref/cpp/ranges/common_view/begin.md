constexpr auto begin() requires (!__simple_view<V>);

(1)
(since C++20)

constexpr auto begin() const requires range<const V>;

(2)
(since C++20)

1) Returns an iterator to the first element of the common_view, that is:

- ranges::begin(base_), if both ranges::random_access_range<V> and ranges::sized_range<V> are satisfied,

- std::common_iterator<ranges::iterator_t<V>, ranges::sentinel_t<V>>(ranges::begin(base_)) otherwise.

Here base_ (the name is for exposition only purposes) is the underlying view.

2) Same as (1), but V is const-qualified.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

An iterator to the beginning of the underlying view.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <ranges>
#include <string_view>
 
int main()
{
constexpr auto common = std::views::iota(1)
std::views::take(3)
std::views::common
;
 
for (int i{}; int e : common)
std::cout << (i++ ? " + " : "") << e;
 
std::cout << " = " << std::accumulate(common.begin(), common.end(), 0) << '\n';
}

Output:

1 + 2 + 3 = 6
