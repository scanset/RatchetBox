1) split_view takes a view and a delimiter, and splits the view into subranges on the delimiter.

2) RangeAdaptorObject. The expression views::split(e, p) is expression-equivalent to split_view(e, p) for any suitable subexpressions e and p.

split_view models the concepts forward_range, and common_range when the underlying view V models respective concepts.

The inner range (ranges::range_reference_t<split_view>) is a ranges::subrange<ranges::iterator_t<V>>, which models common_range, models sized_range when ranges::iterator_t<V> models std::sized_sentinel_for<ranges::iterator_t<V>>, and models contiguous_range, random_access_range, bidirectional_range, and forward_range when V models respective concepts.

Unlike lazy_split_view, split_view maintains the continuity of the subrange, making it suitable for string splitting.

### Data members

Member

Description

V base_ (private)

the underlying (adapted) view
(exposition-only member object*)

Pattern pattern_ (private)

the pattern object that is used as a delimiter to split the underlying view
(exposition-only member object*)

non-propagating-cache<ranges::subrange
    <ranges::iterator_t<V>>> cached_begin_ (private)

an object that caches the result of the first call to begin()
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a split_view 
(public member function)

base

returns a copy of the underlying (adapted) view 
(public member function)

begin

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

end

returns an iterator or a sentinel to the end 
(public member function)

find_next

searches for the next occurrence of the pattern
(exposition-only member function*)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Nested classes

iterator

the iterator type
(exposition-only member class*)

sentinel

the sentinel type
(exposition-only member class*)

### Deduction guides

### Notes

Before P2210R2, split_view used a lazy mechanism for splitting, and thus could not keep the bidirectional, random access, or contiguous properties of the underlying view, or make the iterator type of the inner range same as that of the underlying view. Consequently, it is redesigned by P2210R2, and the lazy mechanism is moved to lazy_split_view.

The delimiter pattern generally should not be an ordinary string literal, as it will consider the null terminator to be necessary part of the delimiter; therefore, it is advisable to use a std::string_view literal instead.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <string_view>
 
int main()
{
using std::operator""sv;
constexpr auto words{"Hello^_^C++^_^20^_^!"sv};
constexpr auto delim{"^_^"sv};
 
for (const auto word : std::views::split(words, delim))
// with string_view's C++23 range constructor:
std::cout << std::quoted(std::string_view(word)) << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

"Hello" "C++" "20" "!"
