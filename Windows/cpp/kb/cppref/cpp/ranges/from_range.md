struct from_range_t { explicit from_range_t() = default; };

(since C++23)

inline constexpr std::from_range_t from_range {};

(since C++23)

std::from_range is a disambiguation tag that can be passed to the constructors of the suitable containers to indicate that the contained member is range constructed.

The corresponding type std::from_range_t can be used in the constructor's parameter list to match the intended tag.
