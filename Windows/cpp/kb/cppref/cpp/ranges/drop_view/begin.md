constexpr auto begin()

    requires (!(/*simple-view*/<V> &&

                 ranges::random_access_range<const V> &&

ranges::sized_range<const V>));

(1)
(since C++20)

constexpr auto begin() const

    requires ranges::random_access_range<const V> &&

ranges::sized_range<const V>;

(2)
(since C++20)

Returns an iterator to the first element of the drop_view, that is, an iterator to the Nth element of the underlying view, or to the end of the underlying view if it has less than N elements.

If V is not a random_access_range or a sized_range, in order to provide the amortized constant time complexity required by the range concept, the overload (1) caches the result within the drop_view object for use on subsequent calls.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

ranges::next(ranges::begin(base_), count_, ranges::end(base_)), where base_ is the underlying view, and count_ is the number of elements to skip.

### Example

Run this code

#include <array>
#include <concepts>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <ranges>
 
void println(std::ranges::range auto const& range)
{
for (auto const& elem : range)
std::cout << elem;
std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
std::array hi{'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'C', '+', '+', '2', '0', '!'};
println(hi);
 
const auto pos = std::distance(hi.begin(), std::ranges::find(hi, 'C'));
auto cxx = std::ranges::drop_view{hi, pos};
std::cout << "*drop_view::begin() == '" << *cxx.begin() << "'\n";
// *cxx.begin() = 'c'; // undefined: 'views' are to be used as observers
println(cxx);
}

Output:

Hello, C++20!
*drop_view::begin() == 'C'
C++20!
