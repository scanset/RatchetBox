class /*sentinel*/;

(since C++20) 
(exposition only*)

The return type of split_view::end when the underlying view type V does not models common_range.

### Data members

Member

Description

ranges::sentinel_t<V> end_ (private)

the sentinel for the underlying view
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

(C++20)

constructs a sentinel 
(public member function)

## std::ranges::split_view::sentinel::sentinel

/*sentinel*/() = default;

(1)
(since C++20)

constexpr explicit /*sentinel*/( ranges::split_view& parent );

(2)
(since C++20)

1) Value-initializes end_ via its default member initializer (= ranges::sentinel_t<V>()).

2) Initializes end_ with ranges::end(parent.base_).

### Non-member functions

operator==

(C++20)

compares the underlying iterator and the underlying sentinel 
(function)

## operator==(std::ranges::split_view::iterator, std::ranges::split_view::sentinel)

friend constexpr bool operator==( const /*iterator*/& x,

                                  const /*sentinel*/& y );

(since C++20)

Equivalent to return x.cur_ == y.end_ and !x.trailing_empty_;.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::ranges::split_view::sentinel is an associated class of the arguments.
