class /*iterator*/;

(since C++20) 
(exposition only*)

The return type of split_view::begin. This is a forward_iterator, so it is expected that V models at least forward_range.

### Data members

Member

Description

ranges::split_view<V, Pattern>* parent_ (private)

a pointer to the parent split_view object
(exposition-only member object*)

ranges::iterator_t<V> cur_ (private)

an iterator into the underlying view that points to the begin of a current subrange
(exposition-only member object*)

ranges::subrange<ranges::iterator_t<V>> next_ (private)

a subrange to the position of the pattern next to the current subrange
(exposition-only member object*)

bool trailing_empty_ (private)

a flag that indicates whether an empty trailing subrange (if any) was reached
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

(C++20)

constructs an iterator 
(public member function)

base

(C++20)

returns the underlying iterator 
(public member function)

operator*

(C++20)

returns the current subrange 
(public member function)

operator++operator++(int)

(C++20)

advances the iterator 
(public member function)

## std::ranges::split_view::iterator::iterator

/*iterator*/() = default;

(1)
(since C++20)

constexpr /*iterator*/( split_view& parent, ranges::iterator_t<V> current,

                        ranges::subrange<ranges::iterator_t<V>> next );

(2)
(since C++20)

1) Value-initializes non-static data members with their default member initializers, that is

- ranges::split_view* parent_ = nullptr;,

- ranges::iterator_t<V> cur_ = ranges::iterator_t<V>();,

- ranges::subrange<ranges::iterator_t<V>> next_ = ranges::subrange<ranges::iterator_t<V>>();, and

- bool trailing_empty_ = false;.

2) Initializes non-static data members:

- ranges::split_view* parent_ = std::addressof(parent);,

- ranges::iterator_t<V> cur_ = std::move(current);,

- ranges::subrange<ranges::iterator_t<V>> next_ = std::move(next);, and

- bool trailing_empty_ = false;.

## std::ranges::split_view::iterator::base

constexpr const ranges::iterator_t<V> base() const;

(since C++20)

Equivalent to return cur_;.

## std::ranges::split_view::iterator::operator*

constexpr value_type operator*() const;

(since C++20)

Equivalent to return {cur_, next_.begin()};.

## std::ranges::split_view::iterator::operator++

constexpr /*iterator*/& operator++();

(1)
(since C++20)

constexpr void operator++( int );

(2)
(since C++20)

1) Equivalent to
cur_ = next_.begin();

if (cur_ != ranges::end(parent_->base_))

{

    if (cur_ = next_.end(); cur_ == ranges::end(parent_->base_))

    {

        trailing_empty_ = true;

        next_ = {cur_, cur_};

    }

    else

        next_ = parent_->find_next(cur_);

}

else

    trailing_empty_ = false;

return *this;

2) Equivalent to auto tmp = *this; ++*this; return tmp;.

### Non-member functions

operator==

(C++20)

compares the underlying iterators 
(function)

## operator==(std::ranges::split_view::iterator, std::ranges::split_view::iterator)

friend constexpr bool operator==( const /*iterator*/& x, const /*iterator*/& y );

(since C++20)

Equivalent to return x.cur_ == y.cur_ and x.trailing_empty_ == y.trailing_empty_;.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::ranges::split_view::iterator is an associated class of the arguments.
