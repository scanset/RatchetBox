template< bool Const >

class /*iterator*/

(since C++20) 
(exposition only*)

The return type of transform_view::begin, and of transform_view::end when the underlying view is a common_range.

The type /*iterator*/<true> is returned by the const-qualified overloads. The type /*iterator*/<false> is returned by the non-const-qualified overloads.

### Member types

Member type

Definition

Parent (private)

maybe-const ﻿<Const, ranges::transform_view<V, F>>
(exposition-only member type*)

Base (private)

maybe-const ﻿<Const, V>
(exposition-only member type*)

iterator_concept

- std::random_access_iterator_tag, if Base models random_access_range,

- std::bidirectional_iterator_tag, if Base models bidirectional_range,

- std::forward_iterator_tag, if Base models forward_range,

- std::input_iterator_tag otherwise.

iterator_category
(present only if Base models
forward_range)

Let MCF be maybe-const ﻿<Const, F>.

- std::input_iterator_tag, if std::invoke_result_t<MCF&, ranges::range_reference_t<Base>> is not a reference.

Otherwise, let C be std::iterator_traits<ranges::iterator_t<Base>>::iterator_category.

- std::random_access_iterator_tag, if C is std::contiguous_iterator_tag; 

- C, otherwise.

value_type

std::remove_cvref_t<std::invoke_result_t<MCF&, ranges::range_reference_t<Base>>>, where MCF denotes maybe-const ﻿<Const, F>

difference_type

ranges::range_difference_t<Base>

### Data members

Member name

Definition

current_ (private)

An iterator into (possibly const-qualified) V.
(exposition-only member object*)

parent_ (private)

A pointer to parent transform_view.
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs an iterator 
(public member function)

base

returns the underlying iterator 
(public member function)

operator*

accesses the transformed element 
(public member function)

operator[]

accesses an element by index 
(public member function)

operator++operator++(int)operator--operator--(int)operator+=operator-=

advances or decrements the underlying iterator 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator<operator>operator<=operator>=operator<=>

(C++20)

compares the underlying iterators 
(function)

operator+operator-

(C++20)

performs iterator arithmetic 
(function)

iter_move

(C++20)

obtains an rvalue reference to the transformed element 
(function)
