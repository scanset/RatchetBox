template< bool Const >

class /*sentinel*/

(since C++20) 
(exposition only*)

The return type of transform_view::end when the underlying view is not a common_range.

The type /*sentinel*/<true> is returned by the const-qualified overload. The type /*sentinel*/<false> is returned by the non-const-qualified overload.

### Data members

Member object

Definition

ranges::sentinel_t<Base> end_ (private)

A sentinel obtained from (possibly const-qualified) V
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a sentinel 
(public member function)

base

returns the underlying sentinel 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==

(C++20)

compares a sentinel with an iterator returned from transform_view::begin 
(function)

operator-

(C++20)

computes the distance between a sentinel and an iterator returned from transform_view::begin 
(function)
