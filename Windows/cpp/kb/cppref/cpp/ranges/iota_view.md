(since C++20)

1) A range factory that generates a sequence of elements by repeatedly incrementing an initial value. Can be either bounded or unbounded (infinite).

2) views::iota(e) and views::iota(e, f) are expression-equivalent to iota_view<std::decay_t<decltype((e))>>(e) and iota_view(e, f) respectively for any suitable subexpressions e and f.

### Customization point objects

The name views::iota denotes a customization point object, which is a const function object of a literal semiregular class type. For exposition purposes, the cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted as __iota_fn.

All instances of __iota_fn are equal. The effects of invoking different instances of type __iota_fn on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be invocable). Thus, views::iota can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to views::iota above, __iota_fn models

- std::invocable<__iota_fn, Args...>,

- std::invocable<const __iota_fn, Args...>,

- std::invocable<__iota_fn&, Args...>, and

- std::invocable<const __iota_fn&, Args...>.

Otherwise, no function call operator of __iota_fn participates in overload resolution.

### Data members

Member

Definition

W value_

the beginning value
(exposition-only member object*)

Bound bound_

the sentinel value, may be unreachable
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

creates an iota_view 
(public member function)

begin

obtains the beginning iterator of an iota_view 
(public member function)

end

obtains the sentinel denoting the end of an iota_view 
(public member function)

empty

tests whether the iota_view is empty (i.e. the iterator and the sentinel compare equal) 
(public member function)

size

(optional)

obtains the size of an iota_view (only provided if it is bounded) 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

back

returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies bidirectional_range and common_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator[]

returns the nth element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies random_access_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Deduction guides

### Nested classes

iterator

the iterator type
(exposition-only member class*)

sentinel

the sentinel type used when the iota_view is bounded and Bound and W are not the same type
(exposition-only member class*)

### Helper templates

template< std::weakly_incrementable W, std::semiregular Bound >

constexpr bool ranges::enable_borrowed_range<ranges::iota_view<W, Bound>> = true;

(since C++20)

This specialization of ranges::enable_borrowed_range makes iota_view satisfy borrowed_range.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
 
struct Bound
{
int bound;
bool operator==(int x) const { return x == bound; }
};
 
int main()
{
for (int i : std::ranges::iota_view{1, 10})
std::cout << i << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
 
for (int i : std::views::iota(1, 10))
std::cout << i << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
 
for (int i : std::views::iota(1, Bound{10}))
std::cout << i << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
 
for (int i : std::views::iota(1) | std::views::take(9))
std::cout << i << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
 
std::ranges::for_each(std::views::iota(1, 10),
[](int i){ std::cout << i << ' '; });
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
