friend constexpr void iter_swap( const /*iterator*/& x, const /*iterator*/& y )

    noexcept( /*see below*/ )

requires std::indirectly_swappable<ranges::iterator_t<Base>>;

(since C++23)

Swaps the objects pointed to by two underlying iterators (each denoted as current_).

Equivalent to ranges::iter_swap(x.current_, y.current_);.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when stride_view::iterator<Const> is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

iterators

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions
