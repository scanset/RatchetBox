class /*iterator*/

(since C++23) 
(exposition only*)

The return type of stride_view::begin, and of stride_view::end when the underlying view V is a common_range.

The type /*iterator*/<true> is returned by the const-qualified overloads. The type /*iterator*/<false> is returned by the non-const-qualified overloads.

### Member types

Member type

Definition

Parent (private)

maybe-const ﻿<Const, ranges::stride_view>
(exposition-only member type*)

Base (private)

maybe-const ﻿<Const, V>
(exposition-only member type*)

difference_type

ranges::range_difference_t<Base>

value_type

ranges::range_value_t<Base>

iterator_concept

- std::random_access_iterator_tag, if Base models random_access_range. Otherwise,

- std::bidirectional_iterator_tag, if Base models bidirectional_range. Otherwise,

- std::forward_iterator_tag, if Base models forward_range. Otherwise,

- std::input_iterator_tag.

iterator_category
(present only if Base models
forward_range)

Let C denote the type iterator_traits<iterator_t<Base>>::iterator_category.

- std::random_access_iterator_tag, if C models std::derived_from<std::random_access_iterator_tag>.

- C otherwise.

### Data members

Member object

Definition

current_ (private)

ranges::iterator_t<Base>, holds an iterator to the current element.
(exposition-only member object*)

end_ (private)

ranges::sentinel_t<Base>, holds a sentinel to the end.
(exposition-only member object*)

stride_ (private)

ranges::range_difference_t<Base>, holds the stride value.
(exposition-only member object*)

missing_ (private)

ranges::range_difference_t<Base>, usually holds the result of ranges::advance(current_, stride_, end_).
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs an iterator 
(public member function)

base

returns an iterator to current element 
(public member function)

operator*

accesses the element 
(public member function)

operator[]

accesses an element by index 
(public member function)

operator++operator++(int)operator--operator--(int)operator+=operator-=

advances or decrements the underlying iterator 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator<operator>operator<=operator>=operator<=>

(C++23)

compares the underlying iterators 
(function)

operator+operator-

(C++23)

performs iterator arithmetic 
(function)

iter_move

(C++23)

casts the result of dereferencing the underlying iterator to its associated rvalue reference type 
(function)

iter_swap

(C++23)

swaps underlying pointed-to elements 
(function)
