class view_interface;

(since C++20)

std::ranges::view_interface is a helper class template for defining a view interface.

view_interface is typically used with CRTP:

class my_view : public std::ranges::view_interface<my_view>
{
public:
auto begin() const { /*...*/ }
auto end() const { /*...*/ }
// empty() is provided if begin() returns a forward iterator
// and end() returns a sentinel for it.
};

### Member functions

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function)

data

gets the address of derived view's data. Provided if its iterator type satisfies contiguous_iterator. 
(public member function)

size

returns the number of elements in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range and its sentinel and iterator type satisfy sized_sentinel_for. 
(public member function)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function)

back

returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies bidirectional_range and common_range. 
(public member function)

operator[]

returns the nth element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies random_access_range. 
(public member function)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <vector>
 
template<class T, class A>
class VectorView : public std::ranges::view_interface<VectorView<T, A>>
{
public:
VectorView() = default;
 
VectorView(const std::vector<T, A>& vec) :
m_begin(vec.cbegin()), m_end(vec.cend())
{}
 
auto begin() const { return m_begin; }
 
auto end() const { return m_end; }
 
private:
typename std::vector<T, A>::const_iterator m_begin{}, m_end{};
};
 
int main()
{
std::vector<int> v = {1, 4, 9, 16};
 
VectorView view_over_v{v};
 
// We can iterate with begin() and end().
for (int n : view_over_v)
std::cout << n << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
 
// We get operator[] for free when inheriting from view_interface
// since we satisfy the random_access_range concept.
for (std::ptrdiff_t i = 0; i != view_over_v.size(); ++i)
std::cout << "v[" << i << "] = " << view_over_v[i] << '\n';
}

Output:

1 4 9 16
v[0] = 1
v[1] = 4
v[2] = 9
v[3] = 16
