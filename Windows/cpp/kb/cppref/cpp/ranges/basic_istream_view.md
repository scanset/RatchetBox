(exposition only*)

1) A range factory that generates a sequence of elements by repeatedly calling operator>>.

2,3) Convenience alias templates for character types char and wchar_t.

4) views::istream<T>(e) is expression-equivalent to ranges::basic_istream_view<T, typename U::char_type, typename U::traits_type>(e) for any suitable subexpressions e, where U is std::remove_reference_t<decltype(e)>.

The program is ill-formed if U is not both publicly and unambiguously derived from std::basic_istream<typename U::char_type, typename U::traits_type>, which may result in a substitution failure.

5) The exposition-only concept /*stream-extractable*/<Val, CharT, Traits> is satisfied when lvalue of type Val can be extracted from lvalue of type std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>.

The iterator type of basic_istream_view is move-only: it does not meet the LegacyIterator requirements, and thus does not work with pre-C++20 algorithms.

### Customization point objects

The name views::istream<T> denotes a customization point object, which is a const function object of a literal semiregular class type. For exposition purposes, the cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted as __istream_fn<T>.

All instances of __istream_fn<T> are equal. The effects of invoking different instances of type __istream_fn<T> on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be invocable). Thus, views::istream<T> can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to views::istream<T> above, __istream_fn<T> models

- std::invocable<__istream_fn<T>, Args...>,

- std::invocable<const __istream_fn<T>, Args...>,

- std::invocable<__istream_fn<T>&, Args...>, and

- std::invocable<const __istream_fn<T>&, Args...>.

Otherwise, no function call operator of __istream_fn<T> participates in overload resolution.

### Data members

Member

Definition

std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>* stream_

a pointer to the input stream
(exposition-only member object*)

Val value_

the stored value
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a basic_istream_view 
(public member function)

begin

returns an iterator 
(public member function)

end

returns std::default_sentinel 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

Although basic_istream_view is derived from std::ranges::view_interface, it cannot use any of inherited member functions.

(until C++23)

## std::ranges::basic_istream_view::basic_istream_view

constexpr explicit

    basic_istream_view( std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>& stream );

(since C++20)

Initializes stream_ with std::addressof(stream), and value-initializes value_ ﻿.

## std::ranges::basic_istream_view::begin

constexpr auto begin();

(since C++20)

Equivalent to *stream_ >> value_ ﻿; return iterator ﻿{*this};.

## std::ranges::basic_istream_view::end

constexpr std::default_sentinel_t end() const noexcept;

(since C++20)

Returns std::default_sentinel.

### Nested classes

iterator

the iterator type of basic_istream_view
(exposition-only member class*)

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <ranges>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
auto words = std::istringstream{"today is yesterday’s tomorrow"};
for (const auto& s : std::views::istream<std::string>(words))
std::cout << std::quoted(s, '/') << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
 
auto floats = std::istringstream{"1.1 2.2\t3.3\v4.4\f55\n66\r7.7 8.8"};
std::ranges::copy
(
std::views::istream<float>(floats),
std::ostream_iterator<float>{std::cout, ", "}
);
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

/today/ /is/ /yesterday’s/ /tomorrow/
1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 55, 66, 7.7, 8.8,
