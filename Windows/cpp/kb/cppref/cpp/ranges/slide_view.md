1) slide_view is a range adaptor that takes a view and a number n and produces a view whose mth element (a "window") is a view over the mth through (m + n - 1)th elements of the original view.

Let s be the size of the original view. Then the size of produced view is:

- s - n + 1, if s >= n,

- ​0​ otherwise, and the resulting view is empty.

2) The name views::slide denotes a RangeAdaptorObject. Given subexpressions e and n, the expression views::slide(e, n) is expression-equivalent to slide_view(e, n).

If n is not greater than ​0​, the behavior is undefined.

slide_view always models forward_range, and models bidirectional_range, random_access_range, or sized_range if adapted view type models the corresponding concept.

### Data members

Member object

Definition

base_ (private)

The underlying view of type V.
(exposition-only member object*)

n_ (private)

The "window size" of type ranges::range_difference_t<V>.
(exposition-only member object*)

cached_begin_ (private) 
(present only if V models the slide-caches-first)

An optional-like object.
(exposition-only member object*)

cached_end_ (private) 
(present only if V models the slide-caches-last)

An optional-like object.
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a slide_view 
(public member function)

begin

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

end

returns an iterator or a sentinel to the end 
(public member function)

size

returns the number of elements. Provided only if the underlying (adapted) range satisfies sized_range. 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

back

returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies bidirectional_range and common_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator[]

returns the nth element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies random_access_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Deduction guides

### Nested classes

iterator

(C++23)

the iterator type
(exposition-only member class template*)

sentinel

(C++23)

the sentinel type used when slide_view is not a common_range
(exposition-only member class template*)

### Helper templates

template< class V >

constexpr bool ranges::enable_borrowed_range<slide_view<V>> =

ranges::enable_borrowed_range<V>;

(since C++23)

This specialization of ranges::enable_borrowed_range makes slide_view satisfy borrowed_range when the underlying view satisfies it.

### Notes

There are similarities between ranges::adjacent_view and ranges::slide_view:

- Both create a "sliding window" of size N.

- Both have the same size S - N + 1, where S is the size of an adapted view such that S >= N > 0.

The following table shows the differences between these adaptors:

View adaptor
value_type
The window size N

ranges::adjacent_view
std::tuple
A template parameter

ranges::slide_view
ranges::range
A runtime argument

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
 
auto print_subrange = [](std::ranges::viewable_range auto&& r)
{
std::cout << '[';
for (char space[]{0,0}; auto elem : r)
std::cout << space << elem, *space = ' ';
std::cout << "] ";
};
 
int main()
{
const auto v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
 
std::cout << "All sliding windows of width:\n";
for (const unsigned width : std::views::iota(1U, 1U + v.size()))
{
auto const windows = v | std::views::slide(width);
std::cout << "W = " << width << ": ";
std::ranges::for_each(windows, print_subrange);
std::cout << '\n';
}
}

Output:

All sliding windows of width W:
W = 1: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 
W = 2: [1 2] [2 3] [3 4] [4 5] [5 6] 
W = 3: [1 2 3] [2 3 4] [3 4 5] [4 5 6] 
W = 4: [1 2 3 4] [2 3 4 5] [3 4 5 6] 
W = 5: [1 2 3 4 5] [2 3 4 5 6] 
W = 6: [1 2 3 4 5 6]
