    requires (!/*is-integer-like*/<W>

iota_view( W, Bound ) -> iota_view<W, Bound>;

(since C++20)

This deduction guide is provided for iota_view to allow deduction from an initial value and a bounding value.

For the definitions of /*is-integer-like*/ and /*is-signed-integer-like*/, see is-integer-like ﻿.

Note that the guide protects itself against bugs arising from sign mismatch, like views::iota(0, v.size()), where ​0​ is signed and v.size() is unsigned.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
auto io = std::ranges::iota_view(1L, 7L); // deduces W and Bound as “long”
assert(io.front() == 1L and io.back() == 6L);
}
