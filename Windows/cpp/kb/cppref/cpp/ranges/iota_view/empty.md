constexpr bool empty() const;

(since C++20)

Checks whether the range is empty (i.e. whether the beginning value is the same as the sentinel value).

### Return value

value_ == bound_

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
auto a = std::ranges::iota_view<int, int>();
assert(a.empty());
 
auto b = std::ranges::iota_view(4);
assert(!b.empty());
 
auto c = std::ranges::iota_view(4, 8);
assert(!c.empty());
}
