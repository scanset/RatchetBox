constexpr auto size() const

    requires (std::same_as<W, Bound> && /*advanceable*/<W>)

             (/*is-integer-like*/<W> && /*is-integer-like*/<Bound>)

std::sized_sentinel_for<Bound, W>;

(since C++20)

Returns the size of the view if the view is bounded.

For the definitions of /*advanceable*/ and /*is-integer-like*/, see advanceable and is-integer-like respectively.

### Return value

If any of W and Bound is not a integer-like type, returns to-unsigned-like ﻿(bound_ - value_ ﻿).

Otherwise, returns 
(value_ < 0) ?

    (

        (bound_ < 0) ?

            to-unsigned-like ﻿(-value_ ﻿) - to-unsigned-like ﻿(-bound_ ﻿) :

            to-unsigned-like ﻿(bound_ ﻿) + to-unsigned-like ﻿(-value_ ﻿)

    ) :

    to-unsigned-like ﻿(bound_ ﻿) - to-unsigned-like ﻿(value_ ﻿)
.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
unsigned initial_value{1}, bound{5};
auto i{std::views::iota(initial_value, bound)};
assert(i.size() == bound - initial_value and i.size() == 4);
 
auto u{std::views::iota(8)};
// assert(u.size()); // Error: size() is not present since “u” is unbounded
}
