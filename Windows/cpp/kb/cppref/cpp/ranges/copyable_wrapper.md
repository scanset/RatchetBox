(exposition only*)

ranges::single_view, ranges::repeat_view,(since C++23) and range adaptors that store an invocable object are specified in terms of an exposition-only class template copyable-box(until C++23)movable-box(since C++23). The name shown here is for exposition purposes only.

The wrapper behaves exactly like std::optional<T>, except that the default constructor, copy assignment operator, and move assignment operator are (conditionally) different from those of std::optional, which augments T with assignability when needed and makes it always satisfy copyableor movable(since C++23).

If T is already copyable, or both std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T> and std::is_nothrow_copy_constructible_v<T> are true, /*copyable-box*/<T> may store only a T object, because it always contains a value.

(until C++23)

If T

- is already copyable, or

- is copy_constructible and both std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T> and std::is_nothrow_copy_constructible_v<T> are true, or

- does not satisfy copy_constructible but satisfies movable, or

- does not satisfy copy_constructible but std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T> is true,

/*movable-box*/<T> may store only a T object, because it always contains a value.

(since C++23)

### Template parameters

T

-

the type of the contained value, must be an object type that models copy_constructible(until C++23)move_constructible(since C++23)

### Member functions

## Default constructor

constexpr /*copyable-box*/() noexcept(std::is_nothrow_default_constructible_v<T>)

    requires std::default_initializable<T>

: /*copyable-box*/(std::in_place) { }

(since C++20) 
(until C++23)

constexpr /*movable-box*/() noexcept(std::is_nothrow_default_constructible_v<T>)

    requires std::default_initializable<T>

: /*movable-box*/(std::in_place) { }

(since C++23)

The default constructor is provided if and only if T models default_initializable.

A default-constructed wrapper contains a value-initialized T object.

## Assignment operators

(1)

constexpr /*copyable-box*/& operator=(const /*copyable-box*/& other);

    noexcept(/* see below */);

(since C++20) 
(until C++23)

constexpr /*movable-box*/& operator=(const /*movable-box*/& other);

    noexcept(/* see below */) requires std::copy_constructible<T>;

(since C++23)

(2)

constexpr /*copyable-box*/& operator=(/*copyable-box*/&& other)

    noexcept(std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T>);

(since C++20) 
(until C++23)

constexpr /*movable-box*/& operator=(/*movable-box*/&& other)

    noexcept(std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T>);

(since C++23)

1) If std::copyable<T> is not modeled, the copy assignment operator is equivalently defined as:

constexpr /*copyable-box*/& operator=(const /*copyable-box*/& other)

    noexcept(std::is_nothrow_copy_constructible_v<T>)

{

    if (this != std::addressof(other))

        if (other)

            emplace(*other);

        else

            reset();

return *this;

}

(until C++23)

constexpr /*movable-box*/& operator=(const /*movable-box*/& other)

    noexcept(std::is_nothrow_copy_constructible_v<T>)

    requires std::copy_constructible<T>

{

    if (this != std::addressof(other))

        if (other)

            emplace(*other);

        else

            reset();

return *this;

}

(since C++23)

Otherwise, it is identical to the copy assignment operator of std::optional.

2) If std::movable<T> is not modeled, the move assignment operator is equivalently defined as:

constexpr /*copyable-box*/& operator=(/*copyable-box*/&& other)

    noexcept(std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T>)

{

    if (this != std::addressof(other))

        if (other)

            emplace(std::move(*other));

        else

            reset();

return *this;

}

(until C++23)

constexpr /*movable-box*/& operator=(/*movable-box*/&& other)

    noexcept(std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T>)

{

    if (this != std::addressof(other))

        if (other)

            emplace(std::move(*other));

        else

            reset();

return *this;

}

(since C++23)

Otherwise, it is identical to the move assignment operator of std::optional.

## Members identical to std::optional 

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs the optional object 
(public member function of std::optional<T>)

(destructor)

destroys the contained value, if there is one 
(public member function of std::optional<T>)

operator=

assigns contents 
(public member function of std::optional<T>)

#### Observers 

operator->operator*

accesses the contained value 
(public member function of std::optional<T>)

operator boolhas_value

checks whether the object contains a value 
(public member function of std::optional<T>)

#### Modifiers 

reset

destroys any contained value 
(public member function of std::optional<T>)

emplace

constructs the contained value in-place 
(public member function of std::optional<T>)

### Notes

A copyable-box(until C++23)movable-box(since C++23) does not contain a value only if

- T does not model movable or copyable, and an exception is thrown on move assignment or copy assignment respectively, or

- it is initialized/assigned from another valueless wrapper.

Before P2325R3, the wrapper was called semiregular-box in the standard and always satisfied semiregular, as the default constructor was always provided (which might construct a valueless wrapper).
