class /*sentinel*/;

(since C++20) 
(exposition only*)

The return type of filter_view::end when the underlying view type (V) does not model common_range.

### Data members

Member name

Definition

end_ (private)

The sentinel of the underlying view.
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a sentinel 
(public member function)

base

returns the underlying sentinel 
(public member function)

## std::ranges::filter_view::sentinel::sentinel

/*sentinel*/() = default;

(1)
(since C++20)

constexpr explicit /*sentinel*/( filter_view& parent );

(2)
(since C++20)

1) Value-initializes end_ via its default member initializer (= ranges::sentinel_t<V>()).

2) Initializes end_ with ranges::end(parent.base_).

## std::ranges::filter_view::sentinel::base

constexpr ranges::sentinel_t<V> base() const;

(since C++20)

Equivalent to return end_;.

### Non-member functions

operator==

(C++20)

compares the underlying iterator and the underlying sentinel 
(function)

## operator==(std::ranges::filter_view::iterator, std::ranges::filter_view::sentinel)

friend constexpr bool operator==( const /*iterator*/& x,

                                  const /*sentinel*/& y );

(since C++20)

Equivalent to return x.current_ == y.end_;, where current_ is the underlying iterator wrapped in filter_view::iterator.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::ranges::filter_view::sentinel is an associated class of the arguments.
