(since C++20)

Compares a take_view::/*sentinel*/ with a std::counted_iterator (typically obtained from a call to take_view::begin).

Returns true if y points past the Nth element (where N is the number passed to the constructor of take_view), or if end of underlying view is reached.

The exposition-only alias template /*add-const-if*/ is defined as

template<bool C, class T>
using /*add-const-if*/ = std::conditional_t<C, const T, T>;.

These functions are not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::ranges::take_view::sentinel<Const> is an associated class of the arguments.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

### Parameters

y

-

std::counted_iterator to compare

x

-

sentinel to compare

### Return value

y.count() == 0 | y.base() == x.end_, where end_ denotes the underlying sentinel.
