template< bool Const >

class /*iterator*/;

(exposition only*)

The iterator type of a possibly const-qualified zip_view, returned by zip_view::begin and in certain cases by zip_view::end.

The type /*iterator*/<true> or /*iterator*/<false> treats the underlying views as const-qualified or non-const-qualified respectively.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs an iterator 
(public member function)

operator*

obtains a tuple-like value that consists of underlying pointed-to elements 
(public member function)

operator[]

obtains a tuple-like value that consists of underlying elements at given offset 
(public member function)

operator++operator++(int)operator--operator--(int)operator+=operator-=

advances or decrements the underlying iterators 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator<operator>operator<=operator>=operator<=>

(C++23)

compares the underlying iterators 
(function)

operator+operator-

(C++23)

performs iterator arithmetic on underlying iterators 
(function)

iter_move

(C++23)

obtains a tuple-like value that denotes underlying pointed-to elements to be moved 
(function)

iter_swap

(C++23)

swaps underlying pointed-to elements 
(function)
