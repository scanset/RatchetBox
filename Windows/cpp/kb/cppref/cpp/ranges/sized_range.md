(2)
(since C++20)

1) The sized_range concept specifies the requirements of a range type that knows its size in constant time with the size function.

2) The disable_sized_range exists to allow use of range types that provide a size function (either as a member or as a non-member) but do not in fact model sized_range. Users may specialize disable_sized_range for cv-unqualified program-defined types. Such specializations shall be usable in constant expressions and have type const bool.

### Semantic requirements

1) Given an lvalue t of type std::remove_reference_t<T>, T models sized_range only if

- ranges::size(t)

- has amortized constant-time complexity,

- does not alter the value of t in a manner observable to equality-preserving expressions, and

- is equal to ranges::distance(ranges::begin(t), ranges::end(t)), and

- if ranges::iterator_t<T> models forward_iterator, ranges::size(t) is well-defined regardless of the evaluation of ranges::begin(t) (in other words, a single-pass sized range may support a call to size only before the first call to begin, but a forward range must support size at all times).

### Notes

disable_sized_range cannot be used to opt-out a range whose iterator and sentinel satisfy sized_sentinel_for; std::disable_sized_sentinel_for must be used instead.

disable_sized_range cannot be specialized for array types or reference types.

### Example

Run this code

#include <forward_list>
#include <list>
#include <ranges>
 
static_assert
(
std::ranges::sized_range<std::list<int>> and
not std::ranges::sized_range<std::forward_list<int>>
);
 
int main() {}
