(since C++20)

1) Adapts a given view with different types for iterator/sentinel pair into a view that is also a common_range. A common_view always has the same iterator/sentinel type.

2) RangeAdaptorObject. Let e be a subexpression. Then the expression views::common(e) is expression-equivalent to:

- views::all(e), if it is a well-formed expression and decltype((e)) models common_range;

- common_view{e} otherwise.

### Data members

Member name

Definition

base_ (private)

The underlying view of type V.
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a common_view 
(public member function)

base

returns a copy of the underlying (adapted) view 
(public member function)

begin

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

end

returns an iterator to the end 
(public member function)

size

returns the number of elements. Provided only if the underlying (adapted) range satisfies sized_range. 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

data

gets the address of derived view's data. Provided if its iterator type satisfies contiguous_iterator. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

back

returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies bidirectional_range and common_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator[]

returns the nth element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies random_access_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Deduction guides

### Helper templates

template< class T >

constexpr bool enable_borrowed_range<std::ranges::common_view<T>> =

ranges::enable_borrowed_range<T>;

(since C++20)

This specialization of std::ranges::enable_borrowed_range makes common_view satisfy borrowed_range when the underlying view satisfies it.

### Notes

common_view can be useful for working with legacy algorithms that expect the iterator and sentinel are of the same type.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <list>
#include <numeric>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
auto v1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
auto i1 = std::counted_iterator{v1.begin(), std::ssize(v1)};
auto r1 = std::ranges::subrange{i1, std::default_sentinel};
// auto e1 = std::accumulate(r1.begin(), r1.end(), 0); // error: "common range" required
auto c1 = std::ranges::common_view{r1};
std::cout << "accumulate: " << std::accumulate(c1.begin(), c1.end(), 0) << '\n';
 
// inherited from ranges::view_interface:
std::cout << "c1.front(): " << c1.front() << '\n';
std::cout << "c1.back(): " << c1.back() << '\n';
std::cout << "c1.data(): " << c1.data() << '\n';
std::cout << "c1[0]: " << c1[0] << '\n';
 
auto v2 = std::list{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
auto i2 = std::counted_iterator{v2.begin(), std::ssize(v2)};
auto r2 = std::ranges::subrange{i2, std::default_sentinel};
// auto e2 = std::accumulate(r2.begin(), r2.end(), 0); // error: "common range" required
auto c2 = std::ranges::common_view{ r2 };
std::cout << "accumulate: " << std::accumulate(c2.begin(), c2.end(), 0) << '\n';
 
// inherited from ranges::view_interface:
std::cout << "c2.front(): " << c2.front() << '\n';
// auto e3 = c2.back(); // error: "bidirectional range" required
// auto e4 = c2.data(); // error: "contiguous range" required
// auto e5 = c2[0]; // error: "random access range" required
}

Possible output:

accumulate: 15
c1.front(): 1
c1.back(): 5
c1.data(): 0x7f19937f00d0
c1[0]: 1
accumulate: 15
c2.front(): 1
