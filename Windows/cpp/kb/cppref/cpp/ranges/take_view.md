1) A range adaptor that represents view of the elements from an underlying sequence, starting at the beginning and ending at a given bound.

2) views::take is a RangeAdaptorObject. The expression views::take(e, f) results in a view that represents the first f elements from e. The result is not necessarily a take_view.
views::take(e, f) is expression-equivalent to (where T is std::remove_cvref_t<decltype((e))> and D is ranges::range_difference_t<decltype((e))>):

- ((void)f, decay-copy(e)), if T is a ranges::empty_view, except that the evaluations of e and f are indeterminately sequenced;

- U(ranges::begin(e), ranges::begin(e) + std::min<D>(ranges::distance(e), f)), if T is a specialization of std::span, std::basic_string_view, or ranges::subrange that models both random_access_range and sized_range, where U is

- std::span<typename T::element_type>, if T is a specialization of std::span;

- T, if T is a specialization of std::basic_string_view;

- ranges::subrange<ranges::iterator_t<T>>, if T is a specialization of ranges::subrange;

- ranges::iota_view(*ranges::begin(e),
                  *(ranges::begin(e) + std::min<D>(ranges::distance(e), f))), if T is a specialization of ranges::iota_view that models both random_access_range and sized_range;

- otherwise, if T is a specialization of ranges::repeat_view:

- views::repeat(*e.value_, std::min<D>(ranges::distance(e), f)), if T models sized_range; is such case e is evaluated only once;

- views::repeat(*e.value_, static_cast<D>(e)) otherwise;

(since C++23)

- otherwise, take_view(e, f).

In all cases, decltype((f)) must model std::convertible_to<D>.

take_view models the concepts contiguous_range, random_access_range, bidirectional_range, forward_range, input_range, and sized_range when the underlying view V models respective concepts. It models common_range when the underlying view V models both random_access_range and sized_range.

### Data members

Member name

Definition

base_ (private)

the underlying view of type V
(exposition-only member object*)

count_ (private)

the number of elements to take, of type ranges::range_difference_t<V>
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a take_view 
(public member function)

base

returns a copy of the underlying (adapted) view 
(public member function)

begin

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

end

returns an iterator or a sentinel to the end 
(public member function)

size

returns the number of elements. Provided only if the underlying (adapted) range satisfies sized_range. 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

data

gets the address of derived view's data. Provided if its iterator type satisfies contiguous_iterator. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

back

returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies bidirectional_range and common_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator[]

returns the nth element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies random_access_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Deduction guides

### Nested classes

sentinel

(C++20)

the sentinel type
(exposition-only member class template*)

### Helper templates

template< class T >

constexpr bool enable_borrowed_range<std::ranges::take_view<T>> =

ranges::enable_borrowed_range<T>;

(since C++20)

This specialization of std::ranges::enable_borrowed_range makes take_view satisfy borrowed_range when the underlying view satisfies it.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
namespace views = std::views;
auto print = [](char x){ std::cout << x; };
 
for (const char nums[]{'1', '2', '3'};
int n : views::iota(0, 5))
{
std::cout << "take(" << n << "): ";
// safely takes only upto min(n, nums.size()) elements:
std::ranges::for_each(nums | views::take(n), print);
std::cout << '\n';
}
}

Output:

take(0): 
take(1): 1
take(2): 12
take(3): 123
take(4): 123

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

LWG 3407

C++20

views::take sometimes failed to
construct a sized random access range

the result type is adjusted so
that construction is always valid

LWG 3494

C++20

take_view was never a borrowed_range

it is a borrowed_range if its underlying view is
