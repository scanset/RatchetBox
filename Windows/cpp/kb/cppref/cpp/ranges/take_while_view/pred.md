constexpr const Pred& pred() const;

(since C++20)

Returns a reference to the stored predicate pred_.

If *this does not store a predicate (e.g. an exception is thrown on the assignment to *this, which copy-constructs or move-constructs a Pred), the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

A reference to the stored predicate.

### Example

Run this code

#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
static constexpr int a[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
constexpr auto v = a | std::views::take_while([](int x){ return x < 4; });
const auto pred = v.pred();
static_assert(pred(3));
}
