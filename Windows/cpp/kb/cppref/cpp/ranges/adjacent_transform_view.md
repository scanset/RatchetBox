1) adjacent_transform_view is a range adaptor that takes a view and an invocable object fun, and produces a view whose ith element is a value that is the result of applying fun to each element in [i, i + N) of the original view. F always has arity N.

Let S be the size of the original view. Then the size of produced view is:

- S - N + 1, if S >= N,

- ​0​ otherwise, and the resulting view is empty.

2) The name views::adjacent_transform<N> denotes a RangeAdaptorObject. Given subexpressions e and f, and a constant expression N, the expression views::adjacent_transform<N>(e, f) is expression-equivalent to:

- ((void)e, views::zip_transform(f)), if N is equal to ​0​ and decltype((e)) models forward_range (except that the evaluations of e and f are indeterminately sequenced),

- adjacent_transform_view<views::all_t<decltype((e))>, std::decay_t<decltype((f))>, N>(e, f) otherwise.

3) The name views::pairwise_transform denotes a RangeAdaptorObject that behaves exactly as views::adjacent_transform<2>. In particular, the arity of F is also 2 and fun is a binary invocable object.

adjacent_transform_view always models forward_range, and models bidirectional_range, random_access_range, or sized_range, if adapted view type models the corresponding concept.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a adjacent_transform_view 
(public member function)

begin

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

end

returns an iterator or a sentinel to the end 
(public member function)

size

returns the number of elements. Provided only if the underlying (adapted) range satisfies sized_range. 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

empty

returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies sized_range or forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

back

returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies bidirectional_range and common_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator[]

returns the nth element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies random_access_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Example

Run this code

#include <array>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
constexpr static std::array data{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
constexpr int window{3};
 
auto Fun = [](auto... ints) { return (... + ints); };
// Alternatively, the Fun could be any ternary (if window == 3) callable, e.g.:
// auto Fun = [](int x, int y, int z) { return x + y + z; };
 
constexpr auto view = data | std::views::adjacent_transform<window>(Fun);
 
static_assert(
view.size() == (data.size() - window + 1)
&& std::array{6, 9, 12, 15}
== std::array{view[0], view[1], view[2], view[3]}
&& view[0] == Fun(data[0], data[1], data[2])
&& view[1] == Fun(data[1], data[2], data[3])
&& view[2] == Fun(data[2], data[3], data[4])
&& view[3] == Fun(data[3], data[4], data[5])
);
 
for (int x : view)
std::cout << x << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:
