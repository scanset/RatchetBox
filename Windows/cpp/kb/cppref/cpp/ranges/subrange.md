Helper concepts

template<class From, class To>

concept /*uses-nonqualification-pointer-conversion*/ =

/* see description */;

(2)
(exposition only*)

template<class From, class To>

concept /*convertible-to-non-slicing*/ = /* see description */;

(3)
(exposition only*)

1) The subrange class template combines together an iterator and a sentinel into a single view. It models sized_range whenever the final template parameter is subrange_kind​::​sized (which happens when std::sized_sentinel_for<S, I> is satisfied or when size is passed explicitly as a constructor argument).

2) Determines whether From is convertible to To without qualification conversions. Equivalent to:
template<class From, class To>
concept /*uses-nonqualification-pointer-conversion*/ =
std::is_pointer_v<From> && std::is_pointer_v<To> &&
!std::convertible_to<std::remove_pointer_t<From>(*)[],
std::remove_pointer_t<To>(*)[]>;

3) Determines whether From is convertible to To without derived-to-base conversion:
template<class From, class To>
concept /*convertible-to-non-slicing*/ =
std::convertible_to<From, To> &&
!/*uses-nonqualification-pointer-conversion*/
<std::decay_t<From>, std::decay_t<To>>;

### Data members

Definition

constexpr bool StoreSize [static]

K == ranges::subrange_kind::sized &&
    !std::sized_sentinel_for<S, I>
(exposition-only static member constant*)

I begin_

an iterator to the beginning of the subrange
(exposition-only member object*)

S end_

a sentinel denoting the end of the subrange
(exposition-only member object*)

make-unsigned-like-t ﻿<std::iter_difference_t<I>> size_ 
(present only if StoreSize is true)

the size of the subrange
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

creates a new subrange 
(public member function)

operator PairLike

converts the subrange to a pair-like type 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

begin

obtains the iterator 
(public member function)

end

obtains the sentinel 
(public member function)

empty

checks whether the subrange is empty 
(public member function)

size

obtains the size of the subrange 
(public member function)

#### Iterator operations 

advance

advances the iterator by given distance 
(public member function)

prev

obtains a copy of the subrange with its iterator decremented by a given distance 
(public member function)

next

obtains a copy of the subrange with its iterator advanced by a given distance 
(public member function)

#### Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface 

cbegin

(C++23)

returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

cend

(C++23)

returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator bool

returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if ranges::empty is applicable to it. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

data

gets the address of derived view's data. Provided if its iterator type satisfies contiguous_iterator. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

front

returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies forward_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

back

returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies bidirectional_range and common_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

operator[]

returns the nth element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies random_access_range. 
(public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

### Deduction guides

### Non-member functions

get(std::ranges::subrange)

(C++20)

obtains iterator or sentinel from a std::ranges::subrange 
(function template)

### Helper types

ranges::subrange_kind

(C++20)

specifies whether a std::ranges::subrange models std::ranges::sized_range 
(enum)

std::tuple_size<std::ranges::subrange>

(C++20)

obtains the size of a std::ranges::subrange 
(class template specialization)

std::tuple_element<std::ranges::subrange>

(C++20)

obtains the type of the iterator or the sentinel of a std::ranges::subrange 
(class template specialization)

### Helper templates

template< class I, class S, ranges::subrange_kind K >

constexpr bool ranges::enable_borrowed_range<ranges::subrange<I, S, K>> = true;

(since C++20)

This specialization of ranges::enable_borrowed_range makes subrange satisfy borrowed_range.

### Example

Run this code

#include <map>
#include <print>
#include <ranges>
 
void make_uppercase(char& v)
{
v += 'A' - 'a';
}
 
void uppercase_transform(std::multimap<int, char>& m, int k)
{
auto [first, last] = m.equal_range(k);
for (auto& [_, v] : std::ranges::subrange(first, last))
make_uppercase(v);
}
 
int main()
{
std::multimap<int, char> mm{{4, 'a'}, {3, '-'}, {4, 'b'}, {5, '-'}, {4, 'c'}};
std::println("Before: {}", mm);
uppercase_transform(mm, 4);
std::println("After: {}", mm);
}

Output:

Before: {3: '-', 4: 'a', 4: 'b', 4: 'c', 5: '-'}
After: {3: '-', 4: 'A', 4: 'B', 4: 'C', 5: '-'}
