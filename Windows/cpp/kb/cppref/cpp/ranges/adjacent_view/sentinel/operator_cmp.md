template< bool OtherConst >

    requires std::sentinel_for<ranges::sentinel_t<Base>,

                               ranges::iterator_t</*maybe-const*/<OtherConst, V>>>

friend constexpr bool operator==( const /*iterator*/<OtherConst>& x,

const /*sentinel*/& y );

(since C++23)

Compares the underlying iterator of x with the underlying sentinel of y.

Equivalent to: return x.current_.back() == y.end_, where current_ is underlying array of iterators in x, and end_ is the underlying sentinel in y.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when adjacent_view::sentinel<Const> is an associated class of the arguments.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

### Parameters

x

-

iterator to compare

y

-

sentinel to compare

### Return value

true if the underlying iterator stored in x is the end iterator.
