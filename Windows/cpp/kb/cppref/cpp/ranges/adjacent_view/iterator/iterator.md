ranges::convertible_to<ranges::iterator_t<V>, ranges::iterator_t<Base>>;

Construct an iterator.

1) Default constructor. Value-initializes the underlying array of iterators current_ to Base, as if by std::array<ranges::iterator_t<Base>, N>().

2) Conversion from /*iterator*/<false> to /*iterator*/<true>. Move constructs the underlying current_ member.

This iterator also has two private constructors which is used by ranges::adjacent_view::begin and ranges::adjacent_view::end. These constructors are not accessible to users.

### Parameters
