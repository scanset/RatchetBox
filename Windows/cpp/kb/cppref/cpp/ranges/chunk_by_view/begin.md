constexpr /*iterator*/ begin();

(since C++23)

Returns an iterator to the first element of the chunk_by_view.

Equivalent to:

ranges::iterator_t<V> iter;
 
if (begin_.has_value())
iter = begin_.value();
else
{
iter = /*find_next*/(ranges::begin(base()));
begin_ = iter; // caching
}
 
return /*iterator*/(*this, ranges::begin(base()), iter);

The behavior is undefined if the underlying predicate pred_ does not contain a value.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Iterator to the first element.

### Notes

In order to provide the amortized constant-time complexity required by the range concept, this function caches the result within the data member begin_ for use on subsequent calls.
