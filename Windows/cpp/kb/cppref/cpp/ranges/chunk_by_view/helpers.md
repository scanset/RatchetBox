## std::ranges::chunk_by_view::next

constexpr ranges::iterator_t<V>

    /*find-next*/( ranges::iterator_t<V> current );

(since C++23) 
(exposition only*)

Finds the next chunk.

Let
base_ and
pred_ be appropriate underlying data-members of chunk_by_view.

Equivalent to

return ranges::next
(
ranges::adjacent_find
(
current, ranges::end(base_), std::not_fn(std::ref(*pred_))
),
1, ranges::end(base_)
);

The behavior is undefined if pred_.has_value() is false before the call to this function.

Used in the following non-static member functions:

- ranges::chunk_by_view::iterator::operator++

### Parameters

current

-

the iterator to current element in adapted view

### Return value

An iterator to the next chunk, as described above.

## std::ranges::chunk_by_view::prev

constexpr ranges::iterator_t<V>

    /*find-prev*/( ranges::iterator_t<V> current )

requires ranges::bidirectional_range<V>;

(since C++23) 
(exposition only*)

Finds the previous chunk.

Let
base_ and
pred_ be appropriate underlying data-members of chunk_by_view.

Returns an iterator i in the range [ranges::begin(base_), current) such that:

- ranges::adjacent_find(i, current, std::not_fn(std::ref(*pred_))) is equal to current, and

- if i is not equal to ranges::begin(base_), then bool(std::invoke(*pred_, *ranges::prev(i), *i)) is false.

The behavior is undefined if before the call to this function current == ranges::begin(base_) or pred_.has_value() != true.

Used in the following non-static member functions:

- ranges::chunk_by_view::iterator::operator--

### Parameters

current

-

the iterator to current element in adapted view

### Return value

An iterator to the previous chunk, as described above.
