template<>

class bad_expected_access<void> : public std::exception

(2)
(since C++23)

1) Defines a type of object to be thrown by std::expected::value when accessing an expected object that contains an unexpected value. bad_expected_access<E> stores a copy of the unexpected value.

2) bad_expected_access<void> is the base class of all other bad_expected_access specializations.

### Members of the primary template

(constructor)

constructs a bad_expected_access object 
(public member function)

error

returns the stored value 
(public member function)

what

returns the explanatory string 
(public member function)

## std::bad_expected_access::bad_expected_access

explicit bad_expected_access( E e );

Constructs a new bad_expected_access<E> object. Initializes the stored value with std::move(e).

## std::bad_expected_access::error

const E& error() const & noexcept;

E& error() & noexcept;

const E&& error() const && noexcept;

E&& error() && noexcept;

Returns a reference to the stored value.

## std::bad_expected_access::what 

const char* what() const noexcept override;

Returns the explanatory string.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Pointer to a null-terminated string with explanatory information. The string is suitable for conversion and display as a std::wstring. The pointer is guaranteed to be valid at least until the exception object from which it is obtained is destroyed, or until a non-const member function (e.g. copy assignment operator) on the exception object is called.

### Notes

Implementations are allowed but not required to override what().

### Members of the bad_expected_access<void> specialization

(constructor)

constructs a bad_expected_access<void> object 
(protected member function)

(destructor)

destroys the bad_expected_access<void> object 
(protected member function)

operator=

replaces the bad_expected_access<void> object 
(protected member function)

what

returns the explanatory string 
(public member function)

Special member functions of bad_expected_access<void> are protected. They can only be called by derived classes.
