Defined in header <utility>

struct piecewise_construct_t { explicit piecewise_construct_t() = default; };

(since C++11)

constexpr std::piecewise_construct_t piecewise_construct{};

(2)
(since C++11) 
(inline since C++17)

1) std::piecewise_construct_t is an empty class tag type used to disambiguate between different functions that take two tuple arguments.

2) The constant std::piecewise_construct is an instance of (1).

The overloads that do not use std::piecewise_construct_t assume that each tuple argument becomes the element of a pair. The overloads that use std::piecewise_construct_t assume that each tuple argument is used to construct, piecewise, a new object of specified type, which will become the element of the pair.

### Standard library

The following standard library types and functions use it as a disambiguation tag:

pair

implements binary tuple, i.e. a pair of values 
(class template)

uses_allocator_construction_args

(C++20)

prepares the argument list matching the flavor of uses-allocator construction required by the given type 
(function template)

ranges::repeat_viewviews::repeat

(C++23)

a view consisting of a generated sequence by repeatedly producing the same value
(class template) (customization point object)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <tuple>
#include <utility>
 
struct Foo
{
Foo(std::tuple<int, float>)
{
std::cout << "Constructed a Foo from a tuple\n";
}
 
Foo(int, float)
{
std::cout << "Constructed a Foo from an int and a float\n";
}
};
 
int main()
{
std::tuple<int, float> t(1, 3.14);
 
std::cout << "Creating p1...\n";
std::pair<Foo, Foo> p1(t, t);
 
std::cout << "Creating p2...\n";
std::pair<Foo, Foo> p2(std::piecewise_construct, t, t);
}

Output:

Creating p1...
Constructed a Foo from a tuple
Constructed a Foo from a tuple
Creating p2...
Constructed a Foo from an int and a float
Constructed a Foo from an int and a float
