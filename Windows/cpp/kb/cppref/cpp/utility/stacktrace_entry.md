Defined in header <stacktrace>

class stacktrace_entry;

(since C++23)

The stacktrace_entry class provides operations for querying information about an evaluation in a stacktrace. Each stacktrace_entry object is either empty, or represents an evaluation in a stacktrace.

stacktrace_entry models std::regular and std::three_way_comparable<std::strong_ordering>.

### Member types

native_handle_type

implementation-defined native handle type

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new stacktrace_entry 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destroys the stacktrace_entry 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns the contents of one stacktrace_entry to another 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

native_handle

gets the implementation-defined native handle of the stacktrace_entry 
(public member function)

operator bool

checks whether the stacktrace_entry is empty 
(public member function)

#### Query 

description

gets the description of the evaluation represented by the stacktrace_entry 
(public member function)

source_file

gets the name of the source file that lexically contains the expression or statement whose evaluation is represented by the stacktrace_entry 
(public member function)

source_line

gets the line number that lexically relates the evaluation represented by the stacktrace_entry 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator<=>

(C++23)

compares two stacktrace_entry values 
(function)

to_string

(C++23)

returns a string with a description of the stacktrace_entry 
(function)

operator<<

(C++23)

performs stream output of stacktrace_entry 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::hash<std::stacktrace_entry>

(C++23)

hash support for std::stacktrace_entry 
(class template specialization)

std::formatter<std::stacktrace_entry>

(C++23)

formatting support for stacktrace_entry 
(class template specialization)

### Notes

boost::stacktrace::frame (available in Boost.Stacktrace) can be used instead when std::stacktrace_entry is not available.
