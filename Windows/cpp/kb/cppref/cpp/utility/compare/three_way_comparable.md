(exposition only*)

1) The concept std::three_way_comparable specifies that the three way comparison operator <=> on T yield results consistent with the comparison category implied by Cat.

2) The concept std::three_way_comparable_with specifies that the three way comparison operator <=> on (possibly mixed) T and U operands yield results consistent with the comparison category implied by Cat. Comparing mixed operands yields results equivalent to comparing the operands converted to their common type.

__WeaklyEqualityComparableWith, __PartiallyOrderedWith, and __ComparisonCommonTypeWith are exposition-only concepts. See descriptions of equality_comparable and totally_ordered. 

### Semantic requirements

These concepts are modeled only if they are satisfied and all concepts they subsume are modeled.

1) T and Cat model std::three_way_comparable<T, Cat> only if, given lvalues a and b of type const std::remove_reference_t<T>, following are true:

- (a <=> b == 0) == bool(a == b),

- (a <=> b != 0) == bool(a != b),

- ((a <=> b) <=> 0) and (0 <=> (b <=> a)) are equal,

- bool(a > b) == bool(b < a),

- bool(a >= b) == !bool(a < b),

- bool(a <= b) == !bool(b < a),

- (a <=> b < 0) == bool(a < b),

- (a <=> b > 0) == bool(a > b),

- (a <=> b <= 0) == bool(a <= b), and

- (a <=> b >= 0) == bool(a >= b), and

- if Cat is convertible to std::strong_ordering, T models totally_ordered.

2) T, U, and Cat model std::three_way_comparable_with<T, U, Cat> only if given

- t and t2, lvalues denoting distinct equal objects of types const std::remove_reference_t<T> and std::remove_reference_t<T> respectively, and

- u and u2, lvalues denoting distinct equal objects of types const std::remove_reference_t<U> and std::remove_reference_t<U> respectively.

Let C be std::common_reference_t<const std::remove_reference_t<T>&, const std::remove_reference_t<U>&> and given an expression E and a type C, let CONVERT_TO<C>(E) be:

- static_cast<C>(std::as_const(E)).

(until C++23)

- static_cast<const C&>(std::as_const(E)) if that is a valid expression,

- static_cast<const C&>(std::move(E)) otherwise.

(since C++23)

the following are true: 

- t <=> u and u <=> t have the same domain,

- ((t <=> u) <=> 0) and (0 <=> (u <=> t)) are equal,

- (t <=> u == 0) == bool(t == u),

- (t <=> u != 0) == bool(t != u),

- Cat(t <=> u) == Cat(CONVERT_TO<C>(t2) <=> CONVERT_TO<C>(u2)),

- (t <=> u < 0) == bool(t < u),

- (t <=> u > 0) == bool(t > u),

- (t <=> u <= 0) == bool(t <= u),

- (t <=> u >= 0) == bool(t >= u), and

- if Cat is convertible to std::strong_ordering, T and U model std::totally_ordered_with<T, U>.

### Equality preservation

Expressions declared in requires expressions of the standard library concepts are required to be equality-preserving (except where stated otherwise).

### Implicit expression variations

A requires expression that uses an expression that is non-modifying for some constant lvalue operand also requires implicit expression variations.
