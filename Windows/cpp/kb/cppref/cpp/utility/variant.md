class variant;

(since C++17)

The class template std::variant represents a type-safe union. An instance of std::variant at any given time either holds a value of one of its alternative types, or in the case of error - no value (this state is hard to achieve, see valueless_by_exception).

As with unions, if a variant holds a value of some object type T, the T object is nested within the variant object itself. Variant is not allowed to allocate additional (dynamic) memory.

A variant is not permitted to hold references, arrays, or the type void.

A variant is permitted to hold the same type more than once, and to hold differently cv-qualified versions of the same type.

Consistent with the behavior of unions during aggregate initialization, a default-constructed variant holds a value of its first alternative, unless that alternative is not default-constructible (in which case the variant is not default-constructible either). The helper class std::monostate can be used to make such variants default-constructible.

A program that instantiates the definition of std::variant with no template arguments is ill-formed. std::variant<std::monostate> can be used instead.

If a program declares an explicit or partial specialization of std::variant, the program is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.

### Template parameters

Types

-

the types that may be stored in this variant. All types must meet the Destructible requirements (in particular, array types and non-object types are not allowed).

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs the variant object 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destroys the variant, along with its contained value 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns a variant 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

index

returns the zero-based index of the alternative held by the variant 
(public member function)

valueless_by_exception

checks if the variant is in the invalid state 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

emplace

constructs a value in the variant, in place 
(public member function)

swap

swaps with another variant 
(public member function)

#### Visitation 

visit

(C++26)

calls the provided functor with the argument held by the variant 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

visit

(C++17)

calls the provided functor with the arguments held by one or more variants 
(function template)

holds_alternative

(C++17)

checks if a variant currently holds a given type 
(function template)

get(std::variant)

(C++17)

reads the value of the variant given the index or the type (if the type is unique), throws on error 
(function template)

get_if

(C++17)

obtains a pointer to the value of a pointed-to variant given the index or the type (if unique), returns null on error 
(function template)

operator==operator!=operator<operator<=operator>operator>=operator<=>

(C++17)(C++17)(C++17)(C++17)(C++17)(C++17)(C++20)

compares variant objects as their contained values 
(function template)

std::swap(std::variant)

(C++17)

specializes the std::swap algorithm 
(function template)

### Helper classes

monostate

(C++17)

placeholder type for use as the first alternative in a variant of non-default-constructible types 
(class)

bad_variant_access

(C++17)

exception thrown on invalid accesses to the value of a variant 
(class)

variant_sizevariant_size_v

(C++17)

obtains the size of the variant's list of alternatives at compile time
(class template) (variable template)

variant_alternativevariant_alternative_t

(C++17)

obtains the type of the alternative specified by its index, at compile time
(class template) (alias template)

std::hash<std::variant>

(C++17)

hash support for std::variant 
(class template specialization)

### Helper objects

variant_npos

(C++17)

index of the variant in the invalid state 
(constant)

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <variant>
 
int main()
{
std::variant<int, float> v, w;
v = 42; // v contains int
int i = std::get<int>(v);
assert(42 == i); // succeeds
w = std::get<int>(v);
w = std::get<0>(v); // same effect as the previous line
w = v; // same effect as the previous line
 
// std::get<double>(v); // error: no double in [int, float]
// std::get<3>(v); // error: valid index values are 0 and 1
 
try
{
std::get<float>(w); // w contains int, not float: will throw
}
catch (const std::bad_variant_access& ex)
{
std::cout << ex.what() << '\n';
}
 
using namespace std::literals;
 
std::variant<std::string> x("abc");
// converting constructors work when unambiguous
x = "def"; // converting assignment also works when unambiguous
 
std::variant<std::string, void const*> y("abc");
// casts to void const* when passed a char const*
assert(std::holds_alternative<void const*>(y)); // succeeds
y = "xyz"s;
assert(std::holds_alternative<std::string>(y)); // succeeds
}

Possible output:

std::get: wrong index for variant
