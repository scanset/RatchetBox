Defined in header <format>

class format_error;

(since C++20)

Defines the type of exception object thrown to report errors in the formatting library.

Inheritance diagram

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new format_error object with the given message 
(public member function)

operator=

replaces the format_error object 
(public member function)

## std::format_error::format_error

format_error( const std::string& what_arg );

(1)

format_error( const char* what_arg );

(2)

format_error( const format_error& other ) noexcept;

(3)

1) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg.c_str()) == 0.

2) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string. After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg) == 0.

3) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::format_error then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0. No exception can be thrown from the copy constructor.

### Parameters

what_arg

-

explanatory string

other

-

another exception object to copy

### Exceptions

1,2) May throw std::bad_alloc.

### Notes

Because copying std::format_error is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string. This is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&&: it would have to copy the content anyway.

A derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy constructor. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.

## std::format_error::operator=

format_error& operator=( const format_error& other ) noexcept;

Assigns the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::format_error then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment. No exception can be thrown from the copy assignment operator.

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to assign with

### Return value

*this

### Notes

A derived standard exception class must have a publicly accessible copy assignment operator. It can be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.

## Inherited from std::runtime_error

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

(destructor)

[virtual]

destroys the exception object 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

### Example

Run this code

#include <format>
#include <print>
#include <string_view>
#include <utility>
 
int main()
{
try
{
auto x13{37};
auto args{std::make_format_args(x13)};
std::ignore = std::vformat("{:()}", args); // throws
}
catch(const std::format_error& ex)
{
std::println("{}", ex.what());
}
}

Possible output:

format error: failed to parse format-spec
