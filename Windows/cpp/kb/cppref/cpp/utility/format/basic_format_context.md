class basic_format_context;

(1)
(since C++20)

using format_context = basic_format_context</* unspecified */, char>;

(2)
(since C++20)

using wformat_context = basic_format_context</* unspecified */, wchar_t>;

(3)
(since C++20)

Provides access to formatting state consisting of the formatting arguments and the output iterator.

2) The unspecified template argument is an output iterator that appends to std::string, such as std::back_insert_iterator<std::string>. Implementations typically use an iterator to type-erased buffer type that supports appending to any contiguous and resizable container.

3) The unspecified template argument is an output iterator that appends to std::wstring.

The behavior is undefined if OutputIt does not model std::output_iterator<const CharT&>.

A program that declares an explicit or partial specialization of std::basic_format_context is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.

std::basic_format_context objects can only be created by the implementation. User codes are only allowed to modify the format context via the format function of std::formatter specializations.

### Member functions

(constructor)

[deleted]

basic_format_context cannot be constructed by user code 
(public member function)

operator=

[deleted]

basic_format_context is not assignable 
(public member function)

arg

returns the argument at the given index 
(public member function)

locale

returns the locale used for locale-specific formatting 
(public member function)

out

returns the iterator to output buffer 
(public member function)

advance_to

advances the output iterator to the given position 
(public member function)

## std::basic_format_context::arg

std::basic_format_arg<basic_format_context> arg( std::size_t id ) const;

Returns a std::basic_format_arg holding the id-th argument in args, where args is the parameter pack or std::basic_format_args object passed to the formatting function.

If id is not less than the number of formatting arguments, returns a default-constructed std::basic_format_arg (holding a std::monostate object).

## std::basic_format_context::locale

std::locale locale();

Returns the locale passed to the formatting function, or a default-constructed std::locale if the formatting function does not take a locale.

## std::basic_format_context::out

iterator out();

Returns the iterator to the output buffer. The result is move-constructed from the stored iterator.

## std::basic_format_context::advance_to

void advance_to( iterator it );

Move assigns it to the stored output iterator. After a call to advance_to, the next call to out() will return an iterator with the value that it had before the assignment.
