Defined in header <stacktrace>

template< class Allocator >

std::string to_string( const std::basic_stacktrace<Allocator>& st );

(since C++23)

Returns a string with a description of st.

The description of a basic_stacktrace typically contains description of its entries, although the number of lines is not required to be equal to size().

### Parameters

st

-

a basic_stacktrace whose description is to be returned

### Return value

A string with a description of st.

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions. 

### Notes

Custom allocators support for this function is not provided, because the implementations usually require platform specific allocations, system calls and a lot of CPU intensive work, while a custom allocator does not provide benefits for this function as the platform specific operations take an order of magnitude more time than the allocation.

### Example

Run this code

#include <stacktrace>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
auto trace = std::stacktrace::current();
std::cout << std::to_string(trace) << '\n';
}

Possible output:

0# 0x0000000000402D97 in ./prog.exe
1# __libc_start_main in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
2# 0x0000000000402CA9 in ./prog.exe
