Let s[i] (0 ≤ i < n) denote the (i+1)-th stacktrace entry in the stacktrace of the current evaluation in the current thread of execution, where n is the count of the stacktrace entries in the stackentry.

1) Attempts to create a basic_stacktrace consisting of s[0], s[1], ..., s[n - 1].

2) Attempts to create a basic_stacktrace consisting of s[m], s[m + 1], ..., s[n - 1], where m is min(skip, n).

3) Attempts to create a basic_stacktrace consisting of s[m], s[m + 1], ..., s[o - 1], where m is min(skip, n) and o is min(skip + max_depth, n). The behavior is undefined if the skip + max_depth < skip (i.e. the mathematical result of skip + max_depth overflows).

In all cases, alloc is stored into the created basic_stacktrace and used to allocate the storage for stacktrace entries.

### Parameters

alloc

-

allocator to use for all memory allocations of the constructed basic_stacktrace

skip

-

the number of stacktrace entries to skip

max_depth

-

the maximum depth of the stacktrace entries

### Return value

If the allocation succeeds, the basic_stacktrace described above.

Otherwise, an empty basic_stacktrace.
