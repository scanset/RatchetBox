Defined in header <cstdarg>

void va_start( std::va_list ap, parm_n );

The va_start macro enables access to the variable arguments following the named argument parm_n.

va_start should be invoked with an instance to a valid va_list object ap before any calls to va_arg.

If the parm_n is a pack expansion or an entity resulting from a lambda capture, the program is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.

(since C++11)

If parm_n is of reference type, or of a type not compatible with the type that results from default argument promotions, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

ap

-

an object of the va_list type

parm_n

-

the named parameter preceding the first variable parameter

### Expanded value

(none)

### Notes

va_start is required to support parm_n with overloaded operator&.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstdarg>
#include <iostream>
 
int add_nums(int count...)
{
int result = 0;
std::va_list args;
va_start(args, count);
for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i)
result += va_arg(args, int);
va_end(args);
return result;
}
 
int main()
{
std::cout << add_nums(4, 25, 25, 50, 50) << '\n';
}

Output:

150
