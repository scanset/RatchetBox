void reset() noexcept;

(since C++17) 
(constexpr since C++20)

If *this contains a value, destroy that value as if by value().T::~T(). Otherwise, there are no effects.

*this does not contain a value after this call.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <optional>
 
struct A
{
std::string s;
A(std::string str) : s(std::move(str)) { std::cout << " constructed\n"; }
~A() { std::cout << " destructed\n"; }
A(const A& o) : s(o.s) { std::cout << " copy constructed\n"; }
A(A&& o) : s(std::move(o.s)) { std::cout << " move constructed\n"; }
 
A& operator=(const A& other)
{
s = other.s;
std::cout << " copy assigned\n";
return *this;
}
 
A& operator=(A&& other)
{
s = std::move(other.s);
std::cout << " move assigned\n";
return *this;
}
};
 
int main()
{
std::cout << "Create empty optional:\n";
std::optional<A> opt;
 
std::cout << "Construct and assign value:\n";
opt = A("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit nec.");
 
std::cout << "Reset optional:\n";
opt.reset();
std::cout << "End example\n";
}

Output:

Create empty optional:
Construct and assign value:
constructed
move constructed
destructed
Reset optional:
destructed
End example
