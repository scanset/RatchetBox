template< class... Args >

T& emplace( Args&&... args );

(1)
(since C++17) 
(constexpr since C++20)

template< class U, class... Args >

T& emplace( std::initializer_list<U> ilist, Args&&... args );

(2)
(since C++17) 
(constexpr since C++20)

Constructs the contained value in-place. If *this already contains a value before the call, the contained value is destroyed by calling its destructor.

1) Initializes the contained value by direct-initializing (but not direct-list-initializing) with std::forward<Args>(args)... as parameters.

2) Initializes the contained value by calling its constructor with ilist, std::forward<Args>(args)... as parameters. This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_constructible<T, std::initializer_list<U>&, Args&&...>::value is true.

### Parameters

args...

-

the arguments to pass to the constructor

ilist

-

the initializer list to pass to the constructor

Type requirements

-

T must be constructible from Args... for overload (1)

-

T must be constructible from std::initializer_list and Args... for overload (2)

### Return value

A reference to the new contained value.

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown by the selected constructor of T. If an exception is thrown, *this does not contain a value after this call (the previously contained value, if any, had been destroyed).

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <optional>
 
struct A
{
std::string s;
 
A(std::string str) : s(std::move(str)), id{n++} { note("+ constructed"); }
~A() { note("~ destructed"); }
A(const A& o) : s(o.s), id{n++} { note("+ copy constructed"); }
A(A&& o) : s(std::move(o.s)), id{n++} { note("+ move constructed"); }
 
A& operator=(const A& other)
{
s = other.s;
note("= copy assigned");
return *this;
}
 
A& operator=(A&& other)
{
s = std::move(other.s);
note("= move assigned");
return *this;
}
 
inline static int n{};
int id{};
void note(auto s) { std::cout << " " << s << " #" << id << '\n'; }
};
 
int main()
{
std::optional<A> opt;
 
std::cout << "Assign:\n";
opt = A("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit nec.");
 
std::cout << "Emplace:\n";
// As opt contains a value it will also destroy that value
opt.emplace("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur efficitur.");
 
std::cout << "End example\n";
}

Output:

Assign:
+ constructed #0
+ move constructed #1
~ destructed #0
Emplace:
~ destructed #1
+ constructed #2
End example
~ destructed #2
