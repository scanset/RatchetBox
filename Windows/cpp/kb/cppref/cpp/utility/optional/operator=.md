Replaces contents of *this with the contents of other.

1) If *this contains a value before the call, the contained value is destroyed by calling its destructor as if by value().T::~T(). *this does not contain a value after this call.

2,3) Assigns the state of other.

- If both *this and other do not contain a value, the function has no effect.

- If *this contains a value, but other does not, then the contained value is destroyed by calling its destructor. *this does not contain a value after the call.

- If other contains a value, then depending on whether *this contains a value, the contained value is either direct-initialized or assigned from *other (2) or std::move(*other) (3). Note that a moved-from optional still contains a value.

- Overload (2) is deleted when either std::is_copy_constructible_v<T> or std::is_copy_assignable_v<T> is false. It is trivial if std::is_trivially_copy_constructible_v<T>, std::is_trivially_copy_assignable_v<T> and std::is_trivially_destructible_v<T> are all true.

- Overload (3) does not participate in overload resolution when either std::is_move_constructible_v<T> or std::is_move_assignable_v<T> is false. It is trivial if std::is_trivially_move_constructible_v<T>, std::is_trivially_move_assignable_v<T> and std::is_trivially_destructible_v<T> are all true.

4) Perfect-forwarded assignment: depending on whether *this contains a value before the call, the contained value is either direct-initialized from std::forward<U>(value) or assigned from std::forward<U>(value). The function does not participate in overload resolution unless std::decay_t<U>(until C++20)std::remove_cvref_t<U>(since C++20) is not std::optional<T>, std::is_constructible_v<T, U> is true, std::is_assignable_v<T&, U> is true, and at least one of the following is true:

- T is not a scalar type;

- std::decay_t<U> is not T.

5,6) Assigns the state of other.

- If both *this and other do not contain a value, the function has no effect.

- If *this contains a value, but other does not, then the contained value is destroyed by calling its destructor. *this does not contain a value after the call.

- If other contains a value, then depending on whether *this contains a value, the contained value is either direct-initialized or assigned from *other (5) or std::move(*other) (6). Note that a moved-from optional still contains a value.

- These overloads do not participate in overload resolution unless the following conditions are met:
T is not constructible, convertible, or assignable from any expression of type (possibly const) std::optional<U>, i.e., the following 12 type traits are all false:
std::is_constructible_v<T, std::optional<U>&>

- std::is_constructible_v<T, const std::optional<U>&>

- std::is_constructible_v<T, std::optional<U>&&>

- std::is_constructible_v<T, const std::optional<U>&&>

- std::is_convertible_v<std::optional<U>&, T>

- std::is_convertible_v<const std::optional<U>&, T>

- std::is_convertible_v<std::optional<U>&&, T>

- std::is_convertible_v<const std::optional<U>&&, T>

- std::is_assignable_v<T&, std::optional<U>&>

- std::is_assignable_v<T&, const std::optional<U>&>

- std::is_assignable_v<T&, std::optional<U>&&>

- std::is_assignable_v<T&, const std::optional<U>&&>

- For overload (5), std::is_constructible_v<T, const U&> and std::is_assignable_v<T&, const U&> are both true.

- For overload (6), std::is_constructible_v<T, U> and std::is_assignable_v<T&, U> are both true.

### Parameters

other

-

another optional object whose contained value to assign

value

-

value to assign to the contained value

### Return value

*this

### Exceptions

2-6) Throws any exception thrown by the constructor or assignment operator of T. If an exception is thrown, the initialization state of *this (and of other in case of (2,3) and (5,6)) is unchanged, i.e. if the object contained a value, it still contains a value, and the other way round. The contents of value and the contained values of *this and other depend on the exception safety guarantees of the operation from which the exception originates (copy-constructor, move-assignment, etc.).

3) Has following noexcept specification:  
noexcept(std::is_nothrow_move_assignable_v<T> && std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T>)

### Notes

An optional object op may be turned into an empty optional with both op = {}; and op = nullopt;. The first expression constructs an empty optional object with {} and assigns it to op.

Fully constexpr (1), (4-6)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <optional>
 
int main()
{
std::optional<const char*> s1 = "abc", s2; // constructor
s2 = s1; // assignment
s1 = "def"; // decaying assignment (U = char[4], T = const char*)
std::cout << *s2 << ' ' << *s1 << '\n';
}

Output:

abc def
