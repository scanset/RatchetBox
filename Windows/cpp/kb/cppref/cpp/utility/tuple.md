Defined in header <tuple>

template< class... Types >

class tuple;

(since C++11)

Class template std::tuple is a fixed-size collection of heterogeneous values. It is a generalization of std::pair.

If std::is_trivially_destructible<Ti>::value is true for every Ti in Types, the destructor of std::tuple is trivial.

If a program declares an explicit or partial specialization of std::tuple, the program is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.

### Template parameters

Types...

-

the types of the elements that the tuple stores. Empty list is supported.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new tuple 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns the contents of one tuple to another 
(public member function)

swap

swaps the contents of two tuples 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

make_tuple

(C++11)

creates a tuple object of the type defined by the argument types 
(function template)

tie

(C++11)

creates a tuple of lvalue references or unpacks a tuple into individual objects 
(function template)

forward_as_tuple

(C++11)

creates a tuple of forwarding references 
(function template)

tuple_cat

(C++11)

creates a tuple by concatenating any number of tuples 
(function template)

get(std::tuple)

(C++11)

tuple accesses specified element 
(function template)

operator==operator!=operator<operator<=operator>operator>=operator<=>

(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(removed in C++20)(C++20)

lexicographically compares the values in the tuple 
(function template)

std::swap(std::tuple)

(C++11)

specializes the std::swap algorithm 
(function template)

### Helper concepts

tuple-likepair-like

(C++23)

specifies that a type implemented the tuple protocol
(std::get, std::tuple_element, std::tuple_size)
(exposition-only concept*)

### Helper classes

std::tuple_size<std::tuple>

(C++11)

obtains the size of
a tuple 
(class template specialization) 

std::tuple_element<std::tuple>

(C++11)

obtains the type of the specified element 
(class template specialization)

std::uses_allocator<std::tuple>

(C++11)

specializes the std::uses_allocator type trait 
(class template specialization)

std::basic_common_reference<tuple-like>

(C++23)

determines the common reference type of a tuple and a tuple-like type 
(class template specialization)

std::common_type<tuple-like>

(C++23)

determines the common type of a tuple and a tuple-like type 
(class template specialization)

std::formatter<std::tuple>

(C++23)

formatting support for tuple 
(class template specialization)

ignore

(C++11)

placeholder to skip an element when unpacking a tuple using tie 
(constant)

### Helper specializations

template< class... Ts >

constexpr bool enable_nonlocking_formatter_optimization<std::tuple<Ts...>> 

= (enable_nonlocking_formatter_optimization<Ts> && ...);

(since C++23)

This specialization of std::enable_nonlocking_formatter_optimization enables efficient implementation of std::print and std::println for printing a tuple object when each element type enables it.

### Deduction guides (since C++17)

### Notes

Since the "shape" of a tuple – its size, the types of its elements, and the ordering of those types – are part of its type signature, they must all be available at compile time and can only depend on other compile-time information. This means that many conditional operations on tuples – in particular, conditional prepend/append and filter – are only possible if the conditions can be evaluated at compile time. For example, given a std::tuple<int, double, int>, it is possible to filter on types – e.g. returning a std::tuple<int, int> – but not to filter on whether or not each element is positive (which would have a different type signature depending on runtime values of the tuple), unless all the elements were themselves constexpr.

As a workaround, one can work with tuples of std::optional, but there is still no way to adjust the size based on runtime information.

Until N4387 (applied as a defect report for C++11), a function could not return a tuple using copy-list-initialization:

std::tuple<int, int> foo_tuple()
{
return {1, -1}; // Error until N4387
return std::tuple<int, int>{1, -1}; // Always works
return std::make_tuple(1, -1); // Always works
}

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string>
#include <tuple>
 
std::tuple<double, char, std::string> get_student(int id)
{
switch (id)
{
case 0: return {3.8, 'A', "Lisa Simpson"};
case 1: return {2.9, 'C', "Milhouse Van Houten"};
case 2: return {1.7, 'D', "Ralph Wiggum"};
case 3: return {0.6, 'F', "Bart Simpson"};
}
 
throw std::invalid_argument("id");
}
 
int main()
{
const auto student0 = get_student(0);
std::cout << "ID: 0, "
<< "GPA: " << std::get<0>(student0) << ", "
<< "grade: " << std::get<1>(student0) << ", "
<< "name: " << std::get<2>(student0) << '\n';
 
const auto student1 = get_student(1);
std::cout << "ID: 1, "
<< "GPA: " << std::get<double>(student1) << ", "
<< "grade: " << std::get<char>(student1) << ", "
<< "name: " << std::get<std::string>(student1) << '\n';
 
double gpa2;
char grade2;
std::string name2;
std::tie(gpa2, grade2, name2) = get_student(2);
std::cout << "ID: 2, "
<< "GPA: " << gpa2 << ", "
<< "grade: " << grade2 << ", "
<< "name: " << name2 << '\n';
 
// C++17 structured binding:
const auto [gpa3, grade3, name3] = get_student(3);
std::cout << "ID: 3, "
<< "GPA: " << gpa3 << ", "
<< "grade: " << grade3 << ", "
<< "name: " << name3 << '\n';
}

Output:

ID: 0, GPA: 3.8, grade: A, name: Lisa Simpson
ID: 1, GPA: 2.9, grade: C, name: Milhouse Van Houten
ID: 2, GPA: 1.7, grade: D, name: Ralph Wiggum
ID: 3, GPA: 0.6, grade: F, name: Bart Simpson
