struct common_type<TTuple, UTuple>;

(since C++23)

The common type of two tuple-like types is a std::tuple consists of the common types of all corresponding element type pairs of both types.

Given

- TTypes as the pack formed by the sequence of std::tuple_element_t<i, TTuple> for every integer i in [​0, std::tuple_size_v<TTuple>), and

- UTypes as the pack formed by the sequence of std::tuple_element_t<i, UTuple> for every integer i in [​0, std::tuple_size_v<UTuple>),

the following constraints need to be satisfied:

- TTuple or UTuple is a std::tuple specialization.

- std::is_same_v<TTuple, std::decay_t<TTuple>> is true.

- std::is_same_v<UTuple, std::decay_t<UTuple>> is true.

- std::tuple_size_v<TTuple> equals std::tuple_size_v<UTuple> (TTuple and UTuple have the same number of elements).

- std::tuple<std::common_type_t<TTypes, UTypes>...> denotes a type.
