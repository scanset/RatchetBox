concept tuple-like = /* see below */;

template< class T >

concept pair-like =

tuple-like<T> && std::tuple_size_v<std::remove_cvref_t<T>> == 2;

(2)
(since C++23) 
(exposition only*)

1) A type T models and satisfies the concept tuple-like if std::remove_cvref_t<T> is a specialization of

- std::array,

- std::complex,

(since C++26)

- std::pair,

- std::tuple, or

- std::ranges::subrange.

2) pair-like objects are tuple-like objects with exactly 2 elements.

### Notes

tuple-like types implement the tuple protocol, i.e., such types can be used with std::get, std::tuple_element and std::tuple_size.

Elements of tuple-like types can be bound with structured binding.

tuple-like and pair-like are used in the following standard library components:

(constructor)

constructs a new tuple 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns the contents of one tuple to another 
(public member function)
