(since C++23)

The common reference type of two tuple-like types is a std::tuple consists of the common reference types of all corresponding element type pairs of both types, where the cv and reference qualifiers on the tuple-like types are applied to their element types.

Given

- TTypes as the pack formed by the sequence of std::tuple_element_t<i, TTuple> for every integer i in [​0​, std::tuple_size_v<TTuple>), and

- UTypes as the pack formed by the sequence of std::tuple_element_t<i, UTuple> for every integer i in [​0​, std::tuple_size_v<UTuple>),

the following constraints need to be satisfied:

- TTuple or UTuple is a std::tuple specialization.

- std::is_same_v<TTuple, std::decay_t<TTuple>> is true.

- std::is_same_v<UTuple, std::decay_t<UTuple>> is true.

- std::tuple_size_v<TTuple> equals std::tuple_size_v<UTuple> (TTuple and UTuple have the same number of elements).

- std::tuple<std::common_reference_t<TQual<TTypes>..., UQual<UTypes>>...> denotes a type.
