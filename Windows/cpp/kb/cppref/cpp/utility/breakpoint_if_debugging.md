Defined in header <debugging>

void breakpoint_if_debugging() noexcept;

(since C++26)

Conditional breakpoint: attempts to temporarily halt the execution of the program and transfer control to the debugger if it were able to determine that the debugger is present. Acts as a no-op otherwise.

Formally, the behavior of this function is completely implementation-defined. Equivalent to
if (std::is_debugger_present())
    std::breakpoint();.
