Defined in header <optional>

template< class T >

class optional;

(since C++17)

The class template std::optional manages an optional contained value, i.e. a value that may or may not be present.

A common use case for optional is the return value of a function that may fail. As opposed to other approaches, such as std::pair<T, bool>, optional handles expensive-to-construct objects well and is more readable, as the intent is expressed explicitly.

Any instance of optional<T> at any given point in time either contains a value or does not contain a value.

If an optional<T> contains a value, the value is guaranteed to be nested within the optional object, which means that no dynamic memory allocation ever takes place. Thus, an optional object models an object, not a pointer, even though operator*() and operator->() are defined.

When an object of type optional<T> is contextually converted to bool, the conversion returns true if the object contains a value and false if it does not contain a value.

The optional object contains a value in the following conditions:

- The object is initialized with/assigned from a value of type T or another optional that contains a value.

The object does not contain a value in the following conditions:

- The object is default-initialized.

- The object is initialized with/assigned from a value of type std::nullopt_t or an optional object that does not contain a value.

- The member function reset() is called.

The optional object is a view that contains either one element if it contains a value, or otherwise zero elements if it does not contain a value. The lifetime of the contained element is bound to the object.

(since C++26)

There are no optional references, functions, arrays, or cv void; a program is ill-formed if it instantiates an optional with such a type. In addition, a program is ill-formed if it instantiates an optional with the (possibly cv-qualified) tag types std::nullopt_t or std::in_place_t.

### Template parameters

T

-

the type of the value to manage initialization state for. The type must meet the requirements of Destructible (in particular, array and reference types are not allowed).

### Member types

Member name

Definition

value_type

T

iterator (since C++26)

implementation-defined LegacyRandomAccessIterator, ConstexprIterator, and contiguous_iterator whose value_type and reference are std::remove_cv_t<T> and T&, respectively.

const_iterator (since C++26)

implementation-defined LegacyRandomAccessIterator, ConstexprIterator, and contiguous_iterator whose value_type and reference are std::remove_cv_t<T> and const T&, respectively.

All requirements on the iterator types of a Container apply to the iterator type of optional as well.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs the optional object 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destroys the contained value, if there is one 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns contents 
(public member function)

#### Iterators 

begin

(C++26)

returns an iterator to the beginning 
(public member function)

end

(C++26)

returns an iterator to the end 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

operator->operator*

accesses the contained value 
(public member function)

operator boolhas_value

checks whether the object contains a value 
(public member function)

value

returns the contained value 
(public member function)

value_or

returns the contained value if available, another value otherwise 
(public member function)

#### Monadic operations 

and_then

(C++23)

returns the result of the given function on the contained value if it exists, or an empty optional otherwise 
(public member function)

transform

(C++23)

returns an optional containing the transformed contained value if it exists, or an empty optional otherwise 
(public member function)

or_else

(C++23)

returns the optional itself if it contains a value, or the result of the given function otherwise 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

swap

exchanges the contents 
(public member function)

reset

destroys any contained value 
(public member function)

emplace

constructs the contained value in-place 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator!=operator<operator<=operator>operator>=operator<=>

(C++17)(C++17)(C++17)(C++17)(C++17)(C++17)(C++20)

compares optional objects 
(function template)

make_optional

(C++17)

creates an optional object 
(function template)

std::swap(std::optional)

(C++17)

specializes the std::swap algorithm 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::hash<std::optional>

(C++17)

hash support for std::optional 
(class template specialization)

nullopt_t

(C++17)

indicator of an std::optional that does not contain a value 
(class)

bad_optional_access

(C++17)

exception indicating checked access to an optional that doesn't contain a value 
(class)

### Helpers 

nullopt

(C++17)

an object of type nullopt_t 
(constant)

in_placein_place_typein_place_indexin_place_tin_place_type_tin_place_index_t

(C++17)

in-place construction tag
(tag)

### Helper specializations

template< class T >

constexpr bool ranges::enable_view<std::optional<T>> = true;

(since C++26)

This specialization of ranges::enable_view makes optional satisfy view.

template< class T >

constexpr auto format_kind<std::optional<T>> = range_format::disabled;

(since C++26)

This specialization of format_kind disables the range formatting support of optional.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <optional>
#include <string>
 
// optional can be used as the return type of a factory that may fail
std::optional<std::string> create(bool b)
{
if (b)
return "Godzilla";
return {};
}
 
// std::nullopt can be used to create any (empty) std::optional
auto create2(bool b)
{
return b ? std::optional<std::string>{"Godzilla"} : std::nullopt;
}
 
int main()
{
std::cout << "create(false) returned "
<< create(false).value_or("empty") << '\n';
 
// optional-returning factory functions are usable as conditions of while and if
if (auto str = create2(true))
std::cout << "create2(true) returned " << *str << '\n';
}

Output:

create(false) returned empty
create2(true) returned Godzilla
