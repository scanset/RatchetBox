(2)
(exposition only*)

Registers the function pointed to by func to be called on normal program termination (via std::exit() or returning from the main function)

The functions will be called during the destruction of the static objects, in reverse order: if A was registered before B, then the call to B is made before the call to A. Same applies to the ordering between static object constructors and the calls to atexit: see std::exit.

(until C++11)

The functions may be called concurrently with the destruction of the objects with static storage duration and with each other, maintaining the guarantee that if registration of A was sequenced-before the registration of B, then the call to B is sequenced-before the call to A, same applies to the sequencing between static object constructors and calls to atexit: see std::exit.

(since C++11)

The same function may be registered more than once.

If a function exits via an exception, std::terminate is called.

atexit is thread-safe: calling the function from several threads does not induce a data race.

The implementation is guaranteed to support the registration of at least 32 functions. The exact limit is implementation-defined.

### Parameters

func

-

pointer to a function to be called on normal program termination

### Return value

​0​ if the registration succeeds, nonzero value otherwise.

### Notes

The two overloads are distinct because the types of the parameter func are distinct (language linkage is part of its type).

### Example

Run this code

#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
 
void atexit_handler_1()
{
std::cout << "At exit #1\n";
}
 
void atexit_handler_2()
{
std::cout << "At exit #2\n";
}
 
int main()
{
const int result_1 = std::atexit(atexit_handler_1);
const int result_2 = std::atexit(atexit_handler_2);
 
if (result_1 | result_2)
{
std::cerr << "Registration failed!\n";
return EXIT_FAILURE;
}
 
std::cout << "Returning from main...\n";
return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

Output:

Returning from main...
At exit #2
At exit #1
