std::string description() const;

(since C++23)

Returns a description of the evaluation represented by *this on success, or an empty string on failure other than allocation failure, e.g. when *this is empty.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

A description of the represented evaluation on success, an empty string on failure other than allocation failure.

### Exceptions

Throws std::bad_alloc if memory for the internal data structures or the resulting string cannot be allocated.

### Notes

Custom allocators support for this function is not provided, because the implementations usually require platform specific allocations, system calls and a lot of CPU intensive work, while a custom allocator does not provide benefits for this function as the platform specific operations take an order of magnitude more time than the allocation.
