friend constexpr bool operator==( const stacktrace_entry& lhs,

                                  const stacktrace_entry& rhs ) noexcept;

friend constexpr std::strong_ordering

    operator<=>( const stacktrace_entry& lhs, const stacktrace_entry& rhs ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++23)

1) Compares lhs and rhs for equality. Two stacktrace_entry values are equal if and only if they represent the same stacktrace entry, or both of them are empty.

2) Gets the relative order between lhs and rhs in the unspecified strict total order over all stacktrace_entry values which is consistent with the equality relation established by operator==.

These functions are not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::stacktrace_entry is an associated class of the arguments.

The <, <=, >, >=, and != operators are synthesized from operator<=> and operator== respectively.

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

stacktrace_entry values to compare

### Return value

1) true if two lhs and rhs compare equal, false otherwise.

2) std::strong_ordering::equal if lhs and rhs compare equal.

Otherwise, std::strong_ordering::less if lhs is ordered before rhs in the strict total order.

Otherwise, std::strong_ordering::greater (in which case rhs is ordered before lhs in the strict total order).
