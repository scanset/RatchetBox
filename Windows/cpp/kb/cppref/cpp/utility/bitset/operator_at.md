bool operator[]( std::size_t pos ) const;

(1)
(constexpr since C++11)

reference operator[]( std::size_t pos );

(2)
(constexpr since C++23)

Accesses the bit at position pos. The first version returns the value of the bit, the second version returns an object of type std::bitset::reference that allows modification of the value.

Unlike test(), does not throw exceptions: the behavior is undefined if pos is out of bounds.

### Parameters

pos

-

position of the bit to return

### Return value

1) The value of the requested bit.

2) An object of type std::bitset::reference, which allows writing to the requested bit.

### Exceptions

(none)

### Example

Run this code

#include <bitset>
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::bitset<8> b1{0b00101010}; // binary literal for 42
 
for (std::size_t i = 0; i < b1.size(); ++i)
std::cout << "b1[" << i << "]: " << b1[i] << '\n';
b1[0] = true; // modifies the first bit through bitset::reference
 
std::cout << "After setting bit 0, b1 holds " << b1 << '\n';
}

Output:

b1[0]: 0
b1[1]: 1
b1[2]: 0
b1[3]: 1
b1[4]: 0
b1[5]: 1
b1[6]: 0
b1[7]: 0
After setting bit 0, b1 holds 00101011

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

LWG 11

C++98

1. the description was missing in the C++ standard
2. there was only the non-const overload

1. description added
2. added the const overload

LWG 907

C++98

the behavior of reading the bit at pos was equivalent
to that of test(pos), but test() may throw exceptions

avoids mentioning test()
