bitset& set();

(1)
(noexcept since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++23)

bitset& set( std::size_t pos, bool value = true );

(2)
(constexpr since C++23)

Sets all bits to true or sets one bit to specified value.

1) Sets all bits to true.

2) Sets the bit at position pos to the value value.

### Parameters

pos

-

the position (counting from ​0​, i.e. from least significant to most significant) of the bit to set

value

-

the value to set the bit to

### Return value

*this

### Exceptions

2) Throws std::out_of_range if pos does not correspond to a valid bit position.

### Example

Run this code

#include <bitset>
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::bitset<8> b;
std::cout << b << '\n';
std::cout << b.set() << '\n';
std::cout << b.reset() << '\n';
 
for (std::size_t i = 1; i < b.size(); i += 2)
b.set(i);
 
std::cout << b << '\n';
}

Output:

00000000
11111111
00000000
10101010

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

LWG 186

C++98

the type of value was int

corrected to bool

LWG 2250

C++98

the behavior was undefined if pos does
not correspond to a valid bit position
