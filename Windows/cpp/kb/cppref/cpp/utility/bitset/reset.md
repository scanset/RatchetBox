bitset& reset();

(1)
(noexcept since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++23)

bitset& reset( std::size_t pos );

(2)
(constexpr since C++23)

Sets bits to false.

1) Sets all bits to false

2) Sets the bit at position pos to false.

### Parameters

pos

-

the position of the bit to set

### Return value

*this

### Exceptions

2) Throws std::out_of_range if pos does not correspond to a valid bit position.

### Example

Run this code

#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::bitset<8> b(42);
std::cout << "Bitset is " << b << '\n';
b.reset(1);
std::cout << "After b.reset(1): " << b << '\n';
b.reset();
std::cout << "After b.reset(): " << b << '\n';
}

Output:

Bitset is 00101010
After b.reset(1): 00101000
After b.reset(): 00000000
