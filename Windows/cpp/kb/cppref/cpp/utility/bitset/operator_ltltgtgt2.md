template< class CharT, class Traits, std::size_t N >

std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>&

operator>>( std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>& is, std::bitset<N>& x );

(2)

Inserts or extracts a bitset from a character stream.

1) Writes the bitset x to the character stream os as if by first converting it to a std::basic_string<CharT, Traits> using to_string(), and then writing it into os using the operator<< (which is a FormattedOutputFunction for strings).
The characters to use for ones and zeroes are obtained from the currently-imbued locale by calling std::use_facet<std::ctype<CharT>>(os.getloc()).widen() with '1' and '0' as arguments.

2) Behaves as a FormattedInputFunction. After constructing and checking the sentry object, which may skip leading whitespace, extracts up to N characters from is and stores the characters in the bitset x.
Characters are extracted until either

- N characters have been read,

- end-of-file occurs in is, or

- the next character is neither is.widen('0') nor is.widen('1').

If N > 0 and no characters are extracted, is.setstate(ios_base::failbit) is called.

### Parameters

os

-

the character stream to write to

is

-

the character stream to read from

x

-

the bitset to be read or written

### Return value

1) os

2) is

### Example

Run this code

#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
std::string bit_string = "001101";
std::istringstream bit_stream(bit_string);
 
std::bitset<3> b1;
bit_stream >> b1; // reads "001", stream still holds "101"
std::cout << b1 << '\n';
 
std::bitset<8> b2;
bit_stream >> b2; // reads "101", populates the 8-bit set as "00000101"
std::cout << b2 << '\n';
}

Output:

001
00000101

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

LWG 303

C++98

single-byte characters were extracted from
is, but CharT can have multiple bytes

extracts CharT and compares
it with widened '0' and '1'

LWG 396

C++98

the content written by operator<< was locale-independent

writes widened '0's and '1's

LWG 3199

C++98

extracting a std::bitset<0> always sets failbit

such extraction never sets failbit
