Performs comparison operations on reference_wrapper objects.

1,2) Compares two reference_wrapper objects. The objects compare equal if and only if lhs.get() and rhs.get() are equal.

1) This overload participates in overload resolution only if the expression lhs.get() == rhs.get() is well-formed and its result is convertible to bool.

2) This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

- std::is_const_v<T> is false.

- The expression lhs.get() == rhs.get() is well-formed and its result is convertible to bool.

3) Compares reference_wrapper object with a reference. The parameters compare equal if and only if lhs.get() is equal to ref.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if the expression lhs.get() == ref is well-formed and its result is convertible to bool.

4,5) Compares two reference_wrapper objects using synth-three-way.

4) This overload participates in overload resolution only if the expression synth-three-way(lhs.get(), rhs.get()) is well-formed.

5) This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

- std::is_const_v<T> is false.

- The expression synth-three-way(lhs.get(), rhs.get()) is well-formed.

6) Compares reference_wrapper object with a reference using synth-three-way.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if the expression synth-three-way(lhs.get(), ref) is well-formed.

The <, <=, >, >=, and != operators are synthesized from operator<=> and operator== respectively.

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

reference_wrapper object to compare

ref

-

reference to compare to the reference_wrapper object

### Return value

1,2) lhs.get() == rhs.get().

3) lhs.get() == ref.

4,5) synth-three-way(lhs.get(), rhs.get()).

6) synth-three-way(lhs.get(), ref).

### Exceptions

Throws when and what the comparison throws.

### Notes

The return types of operator<=> are deduced from return statements to avoid hard error when instantiating a std::reference_wrapper<T> with synth-three-way-result<T> being ill-formed.
