reference_wrapper( const reference_wrapper& other ) noexcept;

(constexpr since C++20)

Constructs a new reference wrapper.

1) Converts x to T& as if by T& t = std::forward<U>(x);, then stores a reference to t. This overload participates in overload resolution only if typename std::decay<U>::type is not the same type as reference_wrapper and the expression FUN(std::declval<U>()) is well-formed, where FUN names the set of imaginary functions
void FUN(T&) noexcept;
void FUN(T&&) = delete;

2) Copy constructor. Stores a reference to other.get().

### Parameters

x

-

an object to wrap

other

-

another reference wrapper

### Exceptions

1) noexcept specification:  
noexcept(noexcept(FUN(std::declval<U>())))

where FUN is the set of imaginary functions described in the description above.
