Defined in header <functional>

struct less_equal;

(since C++20)

Function object for performing comparisons. Deduces the parameter types of the function call operator from the arguments (but not the return type).

### Nested types

Definition

is_transparent

unspecified

### Member functions

operator()

checks if the first argument is less than or equal to the second 
(public member function)

## std::ranges::less_equal::operator()

template< class T, class U >

constexpr bool operator()( T&& t, U&& u ) const;

Equivalent to return !ranges::less{}(std::forward<U>(u), std::forward<T>(t));.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::totally_ordered_with<T, U> is satisfied.

### Notes

Unlike std::less_equal, std::ranges::less_equal requires all six comparison operators <, <=, >, >=, == and != to be valid (via the totally_ordered_with constraint) and is entirely defined in terms of 
std::ranges::less.
