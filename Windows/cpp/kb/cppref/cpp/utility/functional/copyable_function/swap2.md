friend void swap( std::copyable_function& lhs, std::copyable_function& rhs ) noexcept;

(since C++26)

Overloads the std::swap algorithm for std::copyable_function. Exchanges the state of lhs with that of rhs. Effectively calls lhs.swap(rhs).

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::copyable_function<FunctionType> is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

-

std::copyable_function objects whose states to swap

### Return value
