friend bool operator==( const std::copyable_function& f, std::nullptr_t ) noexcept;

(since C++26)

Checks whether the wrapper f has a callable target by formally comparing it with std::nullptr_t. Empty wrappers (that is, wrappers without a target) compare equal, non-empty functions compare non-equal.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::copyable_function<FunctionType> is an associated class of the arguments.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

### Parameters
