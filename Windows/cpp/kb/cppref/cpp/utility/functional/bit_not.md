Defined in header <functional>

template< class T = void >

struct bit_not;

(since C++14)

Function object for performing bitwise NOT. Effectively calls operator~ on type T.

### Specializations

The standard library provides a specialization of std::bit_not when T is not specified, which leaves the parameter types and return type to be deduced.

bit_not<void>

(C++14)

function object implementing ~x deducing parameter and return types 
(class template specialization)

### Member functions

operator()

(C++14)

returns the result of bitwise NOT of its argument 
(public member function)

## std::bit_not::operator()

constexpr T operator()( const T& arg ) const;

(since C++14)

Returns the result of bitwise NOT of arg.

### Parameters

arg

-

value to compute bitwise NOT of

### Return value

The result of ~arg.

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions. 

### Possible implementation

constexpr T operator()(const T& arg) const
{
return ~arg;
}

### Notes

Although std::bit_not is added via post-C++11 proposal N3421, it is treated as a part of the resolution for LWG issue 660 (except for its transparent specialization std::bit_not<>) by common implementations, and thus available in their C++98/03 mode.
