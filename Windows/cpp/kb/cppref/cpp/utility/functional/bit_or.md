Defined in header <functional>

template< class T >

struct bit_or;

(until C++14)

template< class T = void >

struct bit_or;

(since C++14)

Function object for performing bitwise OR. Effectively calls operator| on type T.

### Specializations

The standard library provides a specialization of std::bit_or when T is not specified, which leaves the parameter types and return type to be deduced.

bit_or<void>

(C++14)

function object implementing x | y deducing parameter and return types 
(class template specialization)

(since C++14)

result_type (deprecated in C++17)(removed in C++20)

T

first_argument_type (deprecated in C++17)(removed in C++20)

These member types are obtained via publicly inheriting std::binary_function<T, T, T>.

### Member functions

operator()

returns the result of bitwise OR of two arguments 
(public member function)

## std::bit_or::operator()

T operator()( const T& lhs, const T& rhs ) const;

(constexpr since C++14)

Returns the result of bitwise OR of lhs and rhs.

### Parameters

lhs, rhs

-

values to compute bitwise OR of

### Return value

The result of lhs | rhs.

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions. 

### Possible implementation

constexpr T operator()(const T& lhs, const T& rhs) const
{
return lhs | rhs;
}
