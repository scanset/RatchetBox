1) This deduction guide is provided for std::function to allow deduction from functions.

2) This overload participates in overload resolution only if &F::operator() is well-formed when treated as an unevaluated operand and decltype(&F::operator()) is of the form R(G::*)(A...) (optionally cv-qualified, optionally noexcept, optionally lvalue reference qualified). The deduced type is std::function<R(A...)>.

3) This overload participates in overload resolution only if &F::operator() is well-formed when treated as an unevaluated operand and F::operator() is an explicit object parameter function whose type is of form R(G, A...) or R(G, A...) noexcept. The deduced type is std::function<R(A...)>.

4) This overload participates in overload resolution only if &F::operator() is well-formed when treated as an unevaluated operand and F::operator() is a static member function whose type is of form R(A...) or R(A...) noexcept. The deduced type is std::function<R(A...)>.

### Notes

These deduction guides do not allow deduction from a function with ellipsis parameter, and the ... in the types is always treated as a pack expansion.

The type deduced by these deduction guides may change in a later standard revision (in particular, this might happen if noexcept support is added to std::function in a later standard).

### Example

Run this code

#include <functional>
int func(double) { return 0; }
int main() {
std::function f{func}; // guide #1 deduces function<int(double)>
int i = 5;
std::function g = [&](double) { return i; }; // guide #2 deduces function<int(double)>
}
