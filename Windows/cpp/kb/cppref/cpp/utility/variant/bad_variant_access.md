Defined in header <variant>

class bad_variant_access : public std::exception

(since C++17)

std::bad_variant_access is the type of the exception thrown in the following situations:

- std::get(std::variant) called with an index or type that does not match the currently active alternative.

- std::visit called to visit a variant that is valueless_by_exception.

- std::variant::visit called to visit a variant that is valueless_by_exception.

(since C++26)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new bad_variant_access object 
(public member function)

operator=

replaces the bad_variant_access object 
(public member function)

what

returns the explanatory string 
(public member function)

## std::bad_variant_access::bad_variant_access

bad_variant_access() noexcept;

(1)
(since C++17)

bad_variant_access( const bad_variant_access& other ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++17)

Constructs a new bad_variant_access object with an implementation-defined null-terminated byte string which is accessible through what().

1) Default constructor.

2) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::bad_variant_access then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0.

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to copy

## std::bad_variant_access::operator=

bad_variant_access& operator=( const bad_variant_access& other ) noexcept;

(since C++17)

Assigns the contents with those of other.If *this and other both have dynamic type std::bad_variant_access then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment.

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to assign with

### Return value

*this

## std::bad_variant_access::what

virtual const char* what() const noexcept;

(since C++17)

Returns the explanatory string.

### Return value

Pointer to an implementation-defined null-terminated string with explanatory information. The string is suitable for conversion and display as a std::wstring. The pointer is guaranteed to be valid at least until the exception object from which it is obtained is destroyed, or until a non-const member function (e.g. copy assignment operator) on the exception object is called.

The returned string is encoded with the ordinary literal encoding during constant evaluation.

(since C++26)

### Notes

Implementations are allowed but not required to override what().

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

(destructor)

[virtual]

destroys the exception object 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <variant>
 
int main()
{
std::variant<int, float> v;
v = 12;
try
{
std::get<float>(v);
}
catch (const std::bad_variant_access& e)
{
std::cout << e.what() << '\n';
}
}

Possible output:

bad_variant_access
