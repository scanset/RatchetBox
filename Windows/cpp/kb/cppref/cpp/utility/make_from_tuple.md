Defined in header <tuple>

template< class T, class Tuple >

constexpr T make_from_tuple( Tuple&& t );

(since C++17) 
(until C++23)

template< class T, tuple-like Tuple >

constexpr T make_from_tuple( Tuple&& t );

(since C++23)

Construct an object of type T, using the elements of the tuple t as the arguments to the constructor.

Given the exposition-only function /*make-from-tuple-impl*/ defined as follows:

template<class T, tuple-like Tuple, std::size_t... I> // no constraint on Tuple before C++23

constexpr T /*make-from-tuple-impl*/(Tuple&& t, std::index_sequence<I...>)

{

    return T(std::get<I>(std::forward<Tuple>(t))...);

}

The effect is equivalent to:
return /*make-from-tuple-impl*/<T>(
    std::forward<Tuple>(t),
    std::make_index_sequence<std::tuple_size_v<std::remove_reference_t<Tuple>>>{}
);.

If

- std::tuple_size_v<std::remove_reference_t<Tuple>> is 1 and std::reference_constructs_from_temporary_v<
    T, decltype(std::get<0>(std::declval<Tuple>()))> is true, or

(since C++23)

- std::is_constructible_v<T, decltype(std::get<I>(std::declval<Tuple>()))...> is false,

the program is ill-formed.

### Parameters

t

-

tuple whose elements to be used as arguments to the constructor of T

### Return value

The constructed T object or reference.

### Notes

Tuple need not be std::tuple, and instead may be anything that supports std::get and std::tuple_size; in particular, std::array and std::pair may be used.

(until C++23)

Tuple is constrained to be tuple-like, i.e. each type therein is required to be a specialization of std::tuple or another type (such as std::array and std::pair) that models tuple-like.

(since C++23)

Due to guaranteed copy elision, T need not be movable.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <tuple>
 
struct Foo
{
Foo(int first, float second, int third)
{
std::cout << first << ", " << second << ", " << third << '\n';
}
};
 
int main()
{
auto tuple = std::make_tuple(42, 3.14f, 0);
std::make_from_tuple<Foo>(std::move(tuple));
}

Output:

42, 3.14, 0
