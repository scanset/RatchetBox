Declarations are how names are introduced (or re-introduced) into the C++ program. Not all declarations actually declare anything, and each kind of entity is declared differently. Definitions are declarations that are sufficient to use the entity identified by the name. 

A declaration is one of the following:

- Function definition

- Template declaration (including Partial template specialization)

- Explicit template instantiation

- Explicit template specialization

- Namespace definition

- Linkage specification

- Attribute declaration (attr ;)

(since C++11)

- Empty declaration (;)

- A function declaration without a decl-specifier-seq ﻿:

attr ﻿(optional) declarator ;

attr

-

(since C++11) sequence of any number of attributes

declarator

-

a function declarator

This declaration must declare a constructor, destructor, or user-defined type conversion function. It can only be used as part of a template declaration, explicit specialization, or explicit instantiation.

- block-declaration (a declaration that can appear inside a block), which, in turn, can be one of the following:

- asm declaration

- type alias declaration

(since C++11)

- namespace alias definition

- using-declaration

- using directive

- using-enum-declaration

(since C++20)

- static_assert declaration

- opaque enum declaration

(since C++11)

- simple declaration

### Simple declaration

A simple declaration is a statement that introduces, creates, and optionally initializes one or several identifiers, typically variables.

decl-specifier-seq init-declarator-list ﻿(optional) ;

(1)

attr decl-specifier-seq init-declarator-list;

(2)

attr

-

(since C++11) sequence of any number of attributes

decl-specifier-seq

-

sequence of specifiers (see below)

init-declarator-list

-

comma-separated list of declarators with optional initializers. init-declarator-list is optional when declaring a named class/struct/union or a named enumeration

A structured binding declaration is also a simple declaration.(since C++17)

### Specifiers

Declaration specifiers (decl-specifier-seq) is a sequence of the following whitespace-separated specifiers, in any order:

- the typedef specifier. If present, the entire declaration is a typedef declaration and each declarator introduces a new type name, not an object or a function.

- function specifiers (inline, virtual, explicit), only allowed in function declarations.

- the inline specifier is also allowed on variable declarations.

(since C++17)

- the friend specifier, allowed in class and function declarations.

- the constexpr specifier, only allowed in variable definitions, function and function template declarations, and the declaration of static data members of literal type.

(since C++11)

- the consteval specifier, only allowed in function and function template declarations.

- the constinit specifier, only allowed in declaration of a variable with static or thread storage duration. At most one of the constexpr, consteval, and constinit specifiers is allowed to appear in a decl-specifier-seq.

(since C++20)

- storage class specifier (register, (until C++17) static, thread_local, (since C++11) extern, mutable). Only one storage class specifier is allowed, except that thread_local may appear together with extern or static(since C++11).

- Type specifiers (type-specifier-seq), a sequence of specifiers that names a type. The type of every entity introduced by the declaration is this type, optionally modified by the declarator (see below). This sequence of specifiers is also used by type-id. Only the following specifiers are part of type-specifier-seq, in any order:

- class specifier

- enum specifier

- simple type specifier

- char, char8_t, (since C++20) char16_t, char32_t, (since C++11) wchar_t, bool, short, int, long, signed, unsigned, float, double, void

- auto

- decltype specifier

(since C++11)

- pack indexing specifier

(since C++26)

- previously declared class name (optionally qualified)

- previously declared enum name (optionally qualified)

- previously declared typedef-name or type alias(since C++11) (optionally qualified)

- template name with template arguments (optionally qualified, optionally using template disambiguator)

- template name without template arguments (optionally qualified): see class template argument deduction

(since C++17)

- elaborated type specifier

- the keyword class, struct, or union, followed by the identifier (optionally qualified), previously defined as the name of a class.

- the keyword class, struct, or union, followed by template name with template arguments (optionally qualified, optionally using template disambiguator), previously defined as the name of a class template.

- the keyword enum followed by the identifier (optionally qualified), previously declared as the name of an enumeration.

- typename specifier

- cv qualifier

only one type specifier is allowed in a decl-specifier-seq, with the following exceptions:

- const can be combined with any type specifier except itself.

- volatile can be combined with any type specifier except itself.

- signed or unsigned can be combined with char, long, short, or int.

- short or long can be combined with int.

- long can be combined with double.

- long can be combined with long.

(since C++11)

Attributes may appear in decl-specifier-seq, in which case they apply to the type determined by the preceding specifiers.

Repetitions of any specifier in a decl-specifier-seq, such as const static const, or virtual inline virtual are errors, except that long is allowed to appear twice(since C++11).

### Declarators

init-declarator-list is a comma-separated sequence of one or more init-declarators, which have the following syntax:

declarator initializer ﻿(optional)

(1)

declarator requires-clause

(2)

(since C++20)

declarator

-

the declarator

initializer

-

optional initializer (except where required, such as when initializing references or const objects). See Initialization for details.

requires-clause

-

a requires-clause, which adds a constraint to a function declaration

Each init-declarator in an init-declarator sequence S D1, D2, D3; is processed as if it were a standalone declaration with the same specifiers: S D1; S D2; S D3;.

Each declarator introduces exactly one object, reference, function, or (for typedef declarations) type alias, whose type is provided by decl-specifier-seq and optionally modified by operators such as & (reference to) or [] (array of) or () (function returning) in the declarator. These operators can be applied recursively, as shown below.

A declarator is one of the following:

unqualified-id attr ﻿(optional)

(1)

qualified-id attr ﻿(optional)

(2)

... identifier attr ﻿(optional)

(3)

(since C++11)

* attr ﻿(optional) cv ﻿(optional) declarator

(4)

nested-name-specifier * attr ﻿(optional) cv ﻿(optional) declarator

(5)

& attr ﻿(optional) declarator

(6)

&& attr ﻿(optional) declarator

(7)

(since C++11)

noptr-declarator [ constexpr ﻿(optional) ] attr ﻿(optional)

(8)

noptr-declarator ( parameter-list ) cv ﻿(optional) ref ﻿ ﻿(optional) except ﻿(optional) attr ﻿(optional)

(9)

1) The name that is declared.

2) A declarator that uses a qualified identifier (qualified-id) defines or redeclares a previously declared namespace member or class member.

3) Parameter pack, only appears in parameter declarations.

4) Pointer declarator: the declaration S * D; declares D as a pointer to the type determined by decl-specifier-seq S.

5) Pointer to member declaration: the declaration S C::* D; declares D as a pointer to member of C of type determined by decl-specifier-seq S. nested-name-specifier is a sequence of names and scope resolution operators ::

6) Lvalue reference declarator: the declaration S & D; declares D as an lvalue reference to the type determined by decl-specifier-seq S.

7) Rvalue reference declarator: the declaration S && D; declares D as an rvalue reference to the type determined by decl-specifier-seq S.

8) Array declarator. noptr-declarator any valid declarator, but if it begins with *, &, or &&, it has to be surrounded by parentheses.

9) Function declarator. noptr-declarator any valid declarator, but if it begins with *, &, or &&, it has to be surrounded by parentheses. It may end with the optional trailing return type.(since C++11)

In all cases, attr is an optional sequence of attributes. When appearing immediately after the identifier, it applies to the object being declared.

(since C++11)

cv is a sequence of const and volatile qualifiers, where either qualifier may appear at most once in the sequence.

This section is incomplete
Reason: explain declaration name hiding rules; how a variable/function declaration hides a class (but not a typedef) with the same name

### Notes

When a block-declaration appears inside a block, and an identifier introduced by a declaration was previously declared in an outer block, the outer declaration is hidden for the remainder of the block. 

If a declaration introduces a variable with automatic storage duration, it is initialized when its declaration statement is executed. All automatic variables declared in a block are destroyed on exit from the block (regardless how the block is exited: via exception, goto, or by reaching its end), in order opposite to their order of initialization.

### Example

Note: this example demonstrates how some complex declarations are parsed in terms of the language grammar. Other popular mnemonics are: the spiral rule, reading inside-out, and declaration mirrors use. There is also an automated parser at https://cdecl.org.

Run this code

#include <type_traits>
 
struct S
{
int member;
// decl-specifier-seq is "int"
// declarator is "member"
} obj, *pObj(&obj);
// decl-specifier-seq is "struct S { int member; }"
// declarator "obj" declares an object of type S
// declarator "*pObj" declares a pointer to S,
// and initializer "(&obj)" initializes it
 
int i = 1, *p = nullptr, f(), (*pf)(double);
// decl-specifier-seq is "int"
// declarator "i" declares a variable of type int,
// and initializer "= 1" initializes it
// declarator "*p" declares a variable of type int*,
// and initializer "= nullptr" initializes it
// declarator "f()" declares (but doesn't define)
// a function taking no arguments and returning int
// declarator "(*pf)(double)" declares a pointer to function
// taking double and returning int
 
int (*(*var1)(double))[3] = nullptr;
// decl-specifier-seq is "int"
// declarator is "(*(*var1)(double))[3]"
// initializer is "= nullptr"
 
// 1. declarator "(*(*var1)(double))[3]" is an array declarator:
// Type declared is: "(*(*var1)(double))" array of 3 elements
// 2. declarator "(*(*var1)(double))" is a pointer declarator:
// Type declared is: "(*var1)(double)" pointer to array of 3 elements
// 3. declarator "(*var1)(double)" is a function declarator:
// Type declared is: "(*var1)" function taking "(double)",
// returning pointer to array of 3 elements.
// 4. declarator "(*var1)" is a pointer declarator:
// Type declared is: "var1" pointer to function taking "(double)",
// returning pointer to array of 3 elements.
// 5. declarator "var1" is an identifier.
// This declaration declares the object var1 of type "pointer to function
// taking double and returning pointer to array of 3 elements of type int"
// The initializer "= nullptr" provides the initial value of this pointer.
 
// C++11 alternative syntax:
auto (*var2)(double) -> int (*)[3] = nullptr;
// decl-specifier-seq is "auto"
// declarator is "(*var2)(double) -> int (*)[3]"
// initializer is "= nullptr"
 
// 1. declarator "(*var2)(double) -> int (*)[3]" is a function declarator:
// Type declared is: "(*var2)" function taking "(double)", returning "int (*)[3]"
// ...
 
int main()
{
static_assert(std::is_same_v<decltype(var1), decltype(var2)>);
}
