Converts between types with different cv-qualification.

### Syntax

const_cast< target-type >( expression )

Returns a value of type target-type.

### Explanation

Only the following conversions can be done with const_cast:

1) For two similar object pointer or pointer to data member types T1 and T2, a prvalue of type T1 can be converted to T2 if T1 and T2 differ only in cv-qualification (formally, if, considering the qualification-decompositions of both types, each P1_i is the same as P2_i for all i).

- If expression is a null pointer value, the result is also a null pointer value.

- If expression is a null member pointer value, the result is also a null member pointer value.

- If expression points to an object, the result points to the same object.

- If expression points past an object, the result points past the same object.

- If expression points to a data member, the result points to the same data member.

Even if expression is a prvalue, temporary materialization is not performed.

(since C++17)

2) For two object types T1 and T2, if a pointer to T1 can be explicitly converted to the type “pointer to T2” using const_cast<T2*>, then the following conversions can also be made:

- An lvalue of type T1 can be explicitly converted to an lvalue of type T2 using const_cast<T2&>.

- A glvalue of type T1 can be explicitly converted to an xvalue of type T2 using const_cast<T2&&>.

- If T1 is a class or array type, a prvalue of type T1 can be explicitly converted to an xvalue of type T2 using const_cast<T2&&>.

(since C++11)

The result reference refers to the original object.

(until C++17)

If expression is a glvalue, the result reference refers to the original object. Otherwise, the result reference refers to the materialized temporary.

(since C++17)

As with all cast expressions, the result is:

- an lvalue if target-type is an lvalue reference type or an rvalue reference to function type(since C++11);

- an xvalue if target-type is an rvalue reference to object type;

(since C++11)

- a prvalue otherwise.

### Casting away constness

For two different types T1 and T2, a conversion from T1 to T2 casts away constness if there exists a qualification-decomposition of T2 of the form “cv2_0 P2_0 cv2_1 P2_1 ... cv2_n−1 P2_n−1 cv2_n U2”, and there is no qualification conversions that converts T1 to “cv2_0 P1_0 cv2_1 P1_1 ... cv2_n−1 P1_n−1 cv2_n U1” (same cv-components, different P-components and U-components).

If a cast from a prvalue of type T1* to the type T2* casts away constness, casting from an expression of type T1 to a reference to T2 will also cast away constness.

Only const_cast may be used to cast away constness.

“Casting away constness” implies “casting away volatility”, as qualification conversions cannot cast away volatility as well.

### Notes

Pointers to functions and pointers to member functions are not subject to const_cast.

const_cast makes it possible to form a reference or pointer to non-const type that is actually referring to a const object or a reference or pointer to non-volatile type that is actually referring to a volatile object. Modifying a const object through a non-const access path and referring to a volatile object through a non-volatile glvalue results in undefined behavior.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
 
struct type
{
int i;
 
type(): i(3) {}
 
void f(int v) const
{
// this->i = v; // compile error: this is a pointer to const
const_cast<type*>(this)->i = v; // OK as long as the type object isn't const
}
};
 
int main()
{
int i = 3; // i is not declared const
const int& rci = i;
const_cast<int&>(rci) = 4; // OK: modifies i
std::cout << "i = " << i << '\n';
 
type t; // if this was const type t, then t.f(4) would be undefined behavior
t.f(4);
std::cout << "type::i = " << t.i << '\n';
 
const int j = 3; // j is declared const
[[maybe_unused]]
int* pj = const_cast<int*>(&j);
// *pj = 4; // undefined behavior
 
[[maybe_unused]]
void (type::* pmf)(int) const = &type::f; // pointer to member function
// const_cast<void(type::*)(int)>(pmf); // compile error: const_cast does
// not work on function pointers
}

Output:

i = 4
type::i = 4
