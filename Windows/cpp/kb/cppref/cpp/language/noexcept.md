The noexcept operator performs a compile-time check that returns true if an expression is declared to not throw any exceptions.

It can be used within a function template's noexcept specifier to declare that the function will throw exceptions for some types but not others.

### Syntax

noexcept( expression )

Returns a prvalue of type bool. The result is true if the set of potential exceptions of the expression is empty(until C++17)expression is specified to be non-throwing(since C++17), and false otherwise.

expression is an unevaluated operand.

If expression is a prvalue, temporary materialization is applied.

(since C++17)

### Notes

Even if noexcept(expr) is true, an evaluation of expr may still throw as the result of encountering undefined behavior.

If expression is of a class type or (possibly multidimensional) array thereof, temporary materialization requires the destructor be non-deleted and accessible.

(since C++17)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
#include <vector>
 
void may_throw();
void no_throw() noexcept;
auto lmay_throw = []{};
auto lno_throw = []() noexcept {};
 
class T
{
public:
~T(){} // dtor prevents move ctor
// copy ctor is noexcept
};
 
class U
{
public:
~U(){} // dtor prevents move ctor
// copy ctor is noexcept(false)
std::vector<int> v;
};
 
class V
{
public:
std::vector<int> v;
};
 
int main()
{
T t;
U u;
V v;
 
std::cout << std::boolalpha <<
"may_throw() is noexcept(" << noexcept(may_throw()) << ")\n"
"no_throw() is noexcept(" << noexcept(no_throw()) << ")\n"
"lmay_throw() is noexcept(" << noexcept(lmay_throw()) << ")\n"
"lno_throw() is noexcept(" << noexcept(lno_throw()) << ")\n"
"~T() is noexcept(" << noexcept(std::declval<T>().~T()) << ")\n"
// note: the following tests also require that ~T() is noexcept because
// the expression within noexcept constructs and destroys a temporary
"T(rvalue T) is noexcept(" << noexcept(T(std::declval<T>())) << ")\n"
"T(lvalue T) is noexcept(" << noexcept(T(t)) << ")\n"
"U(rvalue U) is noexcept(" << noexcept(U(std::declval<U>())) << ")\n"
"U(lvalue U) is noexcept(" << noexcept(U(u)) << ")\n"
"V(rvalue V) is noexcept(" << noexcept(V(std::declval<V>())) << ")\n"
"V(lvalue V) is noexcept(" << noexcept(V(v)) << ")\n";
}

Output:

may_throw() is noexcept(false)
no_throw() is noexcept(true)
lmay_throw() is noexcept(false)
lno_throw() is noexcept(true)
~T() is noexcept(true)
T(rvalue T) is noexcept(true)
T(lvalue T) is noexcept(true)
U(rvalue U) is noexcept(false)
U(lvalue U) is noexcept(false)
V(rvalue V) is noexcept(true)
V(lvalue V) is noexcept(false)
