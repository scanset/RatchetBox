Binds the specified names to subobjects or elements of the initializer.

Like a reference, a structured binding is an alias to an existing object. Unlike a reference, a structured binding does not have to be of a reference type.

attr ﻿(optional) decl-specifier-seq ref-qualifier ﻿(optional) [ sb-identifier-list ] initializer ﻿;

attr

-

sequence of any number of attributes

decl-specifier-seq

-

sequence of the following specifiers (following the rules of simple declaration):

- constexpr

- constinit

(since C++26)

- static

- thread_local

- const

- volatile (deprecated in C++20)

- auto

ref-qualifier

-

either & or &&

sb-identifier-list

-

list of comma-separated identifiers introduced by this declaration, each identifier may be followed by an attribute specifier sequence(since C++26)

initializer

-

an initializer (see below)

initializer may be one of the following:

= expression

(1)

{ expression }

(2)

( expression )

(3)

expression

-

any expression (except unparenthesized comma expressions)

A structured binding declaration introduces all identifiers in the sb-identifier-list as names in the surrounding scope and binds them to subobjects or elements of the object denoted by expression. The bindings so introduced are called structured bindings.

One of the identifiers in the sb-identifier-list can be preceded by an ellipsis. Such an identifier introduces a structured binding pack.

The identifier must declare a templated entity.

(since C++26)

A structured binding is an identifier in the sb-identifier-list ﻿ that is not preceded by an ellipsis, or an element of a structured binding pack introduced in the same identifier list(since C++26).

### Binding process

A structured binding declaration first introduces a uniquely-named variable (here denoted by e) to hold the value of the initializer, as follows:

- If expression has array type cv1 A and no ref-qualifier is present, define e as attr ﻿(optional) specifiers A e;, where specifiers is a sequence of the specifiers in decl-specifier-seq excluding auto.

Then each element of e is initialized from the corresponding element of expression as specified by the form of initializer ﻿:

- For initializer syntax (1), the elements are copy-initialized.

- For initializer syntaxes (2,3), the elements are direct-initialized.

- Otherwise, define e as attr ﻿(optional) decl-specifier-seq ref-qualifier ﻿(optional) e initializer ﻿;.

We use E to denote the type of the identifier expression e (i.e., E is the equivalent of std::remove_reference_t<decltype((e))>).

A structured binding size of E is the number of structured bindings that need to be introduced by the structured binding declaration.

The number of identifiers in sb-identifier-list must be equal to the structured binding size of E.

(until C++26)

Given the number of identifiers in sb-identifier-list as N and the structured binding size of E as S:

- If there is no structured binding pack, N must be equal to S.

- Otherwise, the number of non-pack elements (i.e., N - 1) must be less than or equal to S, and the number of elements of the structured binding pack is S - N + 1 (which can be zero).

(since C++26)

struct C { int x, y, z; };
 
template<class T>
void now_i_know_my() 
{
auto [a, b, c] = C(); // OK: a, b, c refer to x, y, z, respectively
auto [d, ...e] = C(); // OK: d refers to x; ...e refers to y and z
auto [...f, g] = C(); // OK: ...f refers x and y; g refers to z
auto [h, i, j, ...k] = C(); // OK: the pack k is empty
auto [l, m, n, o, ...p] = C(); // error: structured binding size is too small
}

A structured binding declaration performs the binding in one of three possible ways, depending on E:

- Case 1: If E is an array type, then the names are bound to the array elements.

- Case 2: If E is a non-union class type and std::tuple_size<E> is a complete type with a member named value (regardless of the type or accessibility of such member), then the "tuple-like" binding protocol is used.

- Case 3: If E is a non-union class type but std::tuple_size<E> is not a complete type, then the names are bound to the accessible data members of E.

Each of the three cases is described in more detail below. 

Each structured binding has a referenced type, defined in the description below. This type is the type returned by decltype when applied to an unparenthesized structured binding.

#### Case 1: binding an array

Each structured binding in the sb-identifier-list becomes the name of an lvalue that refers to the corresponding element of the array. The structured binding size of E is equal to the number of array elements.

The referenced type for each structured binding is the array element type. Note that if the array type E is cv-qualified, so is its element type.

int a[2] = {1, 2};
 
auto [x, y] = a; // creates e[2], copies a into e,
// then x refers to e[0], y refers to e[1]
auto& [xr, yr] = a; // xr refers to a[0], yr refers to a[1]

#### Case 2: binding a type implementing the tuple operations

The expression std::tuple_size<E>::value must be a well-formed integral constant expression, and the structured binding size of E is equal to std::tuple_size<E>::value.

For each structured binding, a variable whose type is "reference to std::tuple_element<I, E>::type" is introduced: lvalue reference if its corresponding initializer is an lvalue, rvalue reference otherwise. The initializer for the Ith variable is

- e.get<I>(), if lookup for the identifier get in the scope of E by class member access lookup finds at least one declaration that is a function template whose first template parameter is a non-type parameter

- Otherwise, get<I>(e), where get is looked up by argument-dependent lookup only, ignoring non-ADL lookup.

In these initializer expressions, e is an lvalue if the type of the entity e is an lvalue reference (this only happens if the ref-qualifier is & or if it is && and the initializer expression is an lvalue) and an xvalue otherwise (this effectively performs a kind of perfect forwarding), I is a std::size_t prvalue, and <I> is always interpreted as a template parameter list. 

The variable has the same storage duration as e.

The structured binding then becomes the name of an lvalue that refers to the object bound to said variable.

The referenced type for the Ith structured binding is std::tuple_element<I, E>::type.

float x{};
char y{};
int z{};
 
std::tuple<float&, char&&, int> tpl(x, std::move(y), z);
const auto& [a, b, c] = tpl;
// using Tpl = const std::tuple<float&, char&&, int>;
// a names a structured binding that refers to x (initialized from get<0>(tpl))
// decltype(a) is std::tuple_element<0, Tpl>::type, i.e. float&
// b names a structured binding that refers to y (initialized from get<1>(tpl))
// decltype(b) is std::tuple_element<1, Tpl>::type, i.e. char&&
// c names a structured binding that refers to the third component of tpl, get<2>(tpl)
// decltype(c) is std::tuple_element<2, Tpl>::type, i.e. const int

#### Case 3: binding to data members

Every non-static data member of E must be a direct member of E or the same base class of E, and must be well-formed in the context of the structured binding when named as e.name. E may not have an anonymous union member. The structured binding size of E is equal to the number of non-static data members.

Each structured binding in sb-identifier-list becomes the name of an lvalue that refers to the next member of e in declaration order (bit-fields are supported); the type of the lvalue is that of e.mI, where mI refers to the Ith member.

The referenced type of the Ith structured binding is the type of e.mI if it is not a reference type, or the declared type of mI otherwise.

#include <iostream>
 
struct S
{
mutable int x1 : 2;
volatile double y1;
};
 
S f() { return S{1, 2.3}; }
 
int main()
{
const auto [x, y] = f(); // x is an int lvalue identifying the 2-bit bit-field
// y is a const volatile double lvalue
std::cout << x << ' ' << y << '\n'; // 1 2.3
x = -2; // OK
// y = -2.; // Error: y is const-qualified
std::cout << x << ' ' << y << '\n'; // -2 2.3
}

#### Initialization order

Let valI be the object or reference named by the Ith structured binding in sb-identifier-list ﻿:

- The initialization of e is sequenced before the initialization of any valI.

- The initialization of each valI is sequenced before the initialization of any valJ where I is less than J.

### Notes

Structured bindings cannot be constrained:

template<class T>
concept C = true;
 
C auto [x, y] = std::pair{1, 2}; // error: constrained

(since C++20)

The lookup for member get ignores accessibility as usual and also ignores the exact type of the non-type template parameter. A private template<char*> void get(); member will cause the member interpretation to be used, even though it is ill-formed.

The portion of the declaration preceding [ applies to the hidden variable e, not to the introduced structured bindings:

int a = 1, b = 2;
const auto& [x, y] = std::tie(a, b); // x and y are of type int&
auto [z, w] = std::tie(a, b); // z and w are still of type int&
assert(&z == &a); // passes

The tuple-like interpretation is always used if std::tuple_size<E> is a complete type with a member named value, even if that would cause the program to be ill-formed:

struct A { int x; };
 
namespace std
{
template<>
struct tuple_size<::A> { void value(); };
}
 
auto [x] = A{}; // error; the "data member" interpretation is not considered.

The usual rules for reference-binding to temporaries (including lifetime-extension) apply if a ref-qualifier is present and the expression is a prvalue. In those cases the hidden variable e is a reference that binds to the temporary variable materialized from the prvalue expression, extending its lifetime. As usual, the binding will fail if e is a non-const lvalue reference:

int a = 1;
 
const auto& [x] = std::make_tuple(a); // OK, not dangling
auto& [y] = std::make_tuple(a); // error, cannot bind auto& to rvalue std::tuple
auto&& [z] = std::make_tuple(a); // also OK

decltype(x), where x denotes a structured binding, names the referenced type of that structured binding. In the tuple-like case, this is the type returned by std::tuple_element, which may not be a reference even though a hidden reference is always introduced in this case. This effectively emulates the behavior of binding to a struct whose non-static data members have the types returned by std::tuple_element, with the referenceness of the binding itself being a mere implementation detail.

std::tuple<int, int&> f();
 
auto [x, y] = f(); // decltype(x) is int
// decltype(y) is int&
 
const auto [z, w] = f(); // decltype(z) is const int
// decltype(w) is int&

Structured bindings cannot be captured by lambda expressions:

#include <cassert>
 
int main()
{
struct S { int p{6}, q{7}; };
const auto& [b, d] = S{};
auto l = [b, d] { return b * d; }; // valid since C++20
assert(l() == 42);
}

(until C++20)

A structured binding size is allowed to be ​0​ as long as the sb-identifier-list contains exactly one identifier that can only introduce an empty structured binding pack.

auto return_empty() -> std::tuple<>;
 
template <class>
void test_empty()
{
auto [] = return_empty(); // error
auto [...args] = return_empty(); // OK, args is an empty pack
auto [one, ...rest] = return_empty(); // error, structured binding size is too small
}
