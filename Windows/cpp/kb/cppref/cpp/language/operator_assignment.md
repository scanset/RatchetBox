Notes

- All built-in assignment operators return *this, and most user-defined overloads also return *this so that the user-defined operators can be used in the same manner as the built-ins. However, in a user-defined operator overload, any type can be used as return type (including void).

- T2 can be any type including T.

### Definitions

Copy assignment replaces the contents of the object a with a copy of the contents of b (b is not modified). For class types, this is performed in a special member function, described in copy assignment operator.

Move assignment replaces the contents of the object a with the contents of b, avoiding copying if possible (b may be modified). For class types, this is performed in a special member function, described in move assignment operator.

(since C++11)

For non-class types, copy and move assignment are indistinguishable and are referred to as direct assignment.

Compound assignment replace the contents of the object a with the result of a binary operation between the previous value of a and the value of b.

### Assignment operator syntax

The assignment expressions have the form 

target-expr = new-value

(1)

target-expr op new-value

(2)

target-expr

-

the expression[1] to be assigned to

op

-

one of *=, /= %=, += -=, <<=, >>=, &=, ^=, |=

new-value

-

the expression[2](until C++11)initializer clause(since C++11) to assign to the target

- ↑ target-expr must have higher precedence than an assignment expression.

- ↑ new-value cannot be a comma expression, because its precedence is lower.

1) Simple assignment expression.

2) Compound assignment expression.

If new-value is not an expression, the assignment expression will never match an overloaded compound assignment operator.

(since C++11)

### Built-in simple assignment operator

For the built-in simple assignment, target-expr must be a modifiable lvalue.

The object referred to by target-expr is modified by replacing its value with the result of new-value. If the object referred is of an integer type T, and the result of new-value is of the corresponding signed/unsigned integer type, the value of the object is replaced with the value of type T with the same value representation of the result of new-value.

The result of a built-in simple assignment is an lvalue of the type of target-expr, referring to target-expr. If target-expr is a bit-field, the result is also a bit-field.

#### Assignment from an expression

If new-value is an expression, it is implicitly converted to
the cv-unqualified type of target-expr. When target-expr is a bit-field that cannot represent the value of the expression, the resulting value of the bit-field is implementation-defined.

If target-expr and new-value identify overlapping objects, the behavior is undefined (unless the overlap is exact and the type is the same).

If the type of target-expr is volatile-qualified, the assignment is deprecated, unless the (possibly parenthesized) assignment expression is a discarded-value expression or an unevaluated operand.

(since C++20)

#### Assignment from a non-expression initializer clause

new-value is only allowed not to be an expression in following situations:

- target-expr is of a scalar type T, and new-value is empty or has only one element. In this case, given an invented variable t declared and initialized as T t = new-value ﻿, the meaning of x = new-value ﻿ is x = t.

- target-expr is of class type. In this case, new-value is passed as the argument to the assignment operator function selected by overload resolution.

#include <complex>
 
std::complex<double> z;
z = {1, 2}; // meaning z.operator=({1, 2})
z += {1, 2}; // meaning z.operator+=({1, 2})
 
int a, b;
a = b = {1}; // meaning a = b = 1;
a = {1} = b; // syntax error

(since C++11)

In overload resolution against user-defined operators, for every type T, the following function signatures participate in overload resolution:

T*& operator=(T*&, T*);

T*volatile & operator=(T*volatile &, T*);

For every enumeration or pointer to member type T, optionally volatile-qualified, the following function signature participates in overload resolution:

T& operator=(T&, T);

For every pair A1 and A2, where A1 is an arithmetic type (optionally volatile-qualified) and A2 is a promoted arithmetic type, the following function signature participates in overload resolution:

A1& operator=(A1&, A2);

### Built-in compound assignment operator

The behavior of every built-in compound-assignment expression target-expr op ﻿= new-value is exactly the same as the behavior of the expression target-expr = target-expr op new-value, except that target-expr is evaluated only once.

The requirements on target-expr and new-value of built-in simple assignment operators also apply. Furthermore:

- For += and -=, the type of target-expr must be an arithmetic type or a pointer to a (possibly cv-qualified) completely-defined object type.

- For all other compound assignment operators, the type of target-expr must be an arithmetic type.

In overload resolution against user-defined operators, for every pair A1 and A2, where A1 is an arithmetic type (optionally volatile-qualified) and A2 is a promoted arithmetic type, the following function signatures participate in overload resolution:

A1& operator*=(A1&, A2);

A1& operator/=(A1&, A2);

A1& operator+=(A1&, A2);

A1& operator-=(A1&, A2);

For every pair I1 and I2, where I1 is an integral type (optionally volatile-qualified) and I2 is a promoted integral type, the following function signatures participate in overload resolution:

I1& operator%=(I1&, I2);

I1& operator<<=(I1&, I2);

I1& operator>>=(I1&, I2);

I1& operator&=(I1&, I2);

I1& operator^=(I1&, I2);

I1& operator|=(I1&, I2);

For every optionally cv-qualified object type T, the following function signatures participate in overload resolution:

T*& operator+=(T*&, std::ptrdiff_t);

T*& operator-=(T*&, std::ptrdiff_t);

T*volatile & operator+=(T*volatile &, std::ptrdiff_t);

T*volatile & operator-=(T*volatile &, std::ptrdiff_t);

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
int n = 0; // not an assignment
 
n = 1; // direct assignment
std::cout << n << ' ';
 
n = {}; // zero-initialization, then assignment
std::cout << n << ' ';
 
n = 'a'; // integral promotion, then assignment
std::cout << n << ' ';
 
n = {'b'}; // explicit cast, then assignment
std::cout << n << ' ';
 
n = 1.0; // floating-point conversion, then assignment
std::cout << n << ' ';
 
// n = {1.0}; // compiler error (narrowing conversion)
 
int& r = n; // not an assignment
r = 2; // assignment through reference
std::cout << n << ' ';
 
int* p;
p = &n; // direct assignment
p = nullptr; // null-pointer conversion, then assignment
std::cout << p << ' ';
 
struct { int a; std::string s; } obj;
obj = {1, "abc"}; // assignment from a braced-init-list
std::cout << obj.a << ':' << obj.s << '\n';
}

Possible output:

1 0 97 98 1 2 (nil) 1:abc
