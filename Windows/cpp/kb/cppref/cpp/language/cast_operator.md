Enables implicit conversion or explicit conversion from a class type to another type.

### Syntax

Conversion function is declared like a non-static member function or member function template with no parameters, no explicit return type, and with the name of the form:

operator conversion-type-id

(1)

explicit operator conversion-type-id

(2)

(since C++11)

explicit ( expression ) operator conversion-type-id

(3)

(since C++20)

1) Declares a user-defined conversion function that participates in all implicit and explicit conversions.

2) Declares a user-defined conversion function that participates in direct-initialization and explicit conversions only.

3) Declares a user-defined conversion function that is conditionally explicit.

conversion-type-id is a type-id except that function and array operators [] or () are not allowed in its declarator (thus conversion to types such as pointer to array requires a type alias/typedef or an identity template: see below). Regardless of typedef, conversion-type-id cannot represent an array or a function type.

Although the return type is not allowed in the declaration of a user-defined conversion function, the decl-specifier-seq of the declaration grammar may be present and may include any specifier other than type-specifier or the keyword static, In particular, besides explicit, the specifiers inline, virtual, constexpr(since C++11), consteval(since C++20), and friend are also allowed (note that friend requires a qualified name: friend A::operator B();).

When such member function is declared in class X, it performs conversion from X to 
conversion-type-id:

struct X
{
// implicit conversion
operator int() const { return 7; }
 
// explicit conversion
explicit operator int*() const { return nullptr; }
 
// Error: array operator not allowed in conversion-type-id
// operator int(*)[3]() const { return nullptr; }
 
using arr_t = int[3];
operator arr_t*() const { return nullptr; } // OK if done through typedef
// operator arr_t () const; // Error: conversion to array not allowed in any case
};
 
int main()
{
X x;
 
int n = static_cast<int>(x); // OK: sets n to 7
int m = x; // OK: sets m to 7
 
int* p = static_cast<int*>(x); // OK: sets p to null
// int* q = x; // Error: no implicit conversion
 
int (*pa)[3] = x; // OK
}

### Explanation

User-defined conversion function is invoked in the second stage of the implicit conversion, which consists of zero or one converting constructor or zero or one user-defined conversion function.

If both conversion functions and converting constructors can be used to perform some user-defined conversion, the conversion functions and constructors are both considered by overload resolution in copy-initialization and reference-initialization contexts, but only the constructors are considered in direct-initialization contexts.

struct To
{
To() = default;
To(const struct From&) {} // converting constructor
};
 
struct From
{
operator To() const {return To();} // conversion function
};
 
int main()
{
From f;
To t1(f); // direct-initialization: calls the constructor
// Note: if converting constructor is not available, implicit copy constructor
// will be selected, and conversion function will be called to prepare its argument
 
// To t2 = f; // copy-initialization: ambiguous
// Note: if conversion function is from a non-const type, e.g.
// From::operator To();, it will be selected instead of the ctor in this case
 
To t3 = static_cast<To>(f); // direct-initialization: calls the constructor
const To& r = f; // reference-initialization: ambiguous
}

Conversion function to its own (possibly cv-qualified) class (or to a reference to it), to the base of its own class (or to a reference to it), and to the type void can be defined, but can not be executed as part of the conversion sequence, except, in some cases, through virtual dispatch:

struct D;
 
struct B
{
virtual operator D() = 0;
};
 
struct D : B
{
operator D() override { return D(); }
};
 
int main()
{
D obj;
D obj2 = obj; // does not call D::operator D()
B& br = obj;
D obj3 = br; // calls D::operator D() through virtual dispatch
}

It can also be called using member function call syntax:

struct B {};
 
struct X : B
{
operator B&() { return *this; };
};
 
int main()
{
X x;
B& b1 = x; // does not call X::operatorB&()
B& b2 = static_cast<B&>(x); // does not call X::operatorB&
B& b3 = x.operator B&(); // calls X::operatorB&
}

When making an explicit call to the conversion function, conversion-type-id is greedy: it is the longest sequence of tokens that could possibly form a conversion-type-id (including attributes, if any)(since C++11):

& x.operator int * a; // error: parsed as & (x.operator int*) a,
// not as & (x.operator int) * a
 
operator int [[noreturn]] (); // error: noreturn attribute applied to a type

The placeholder auto can be used in conversion-type-id, indicating a deduced return type:

struct X
{
operator int(); // OK
operator auto() -> short; // error: trailing return type not part of syntax
operator auto() const { return 10; } // OK: deduced return type
operator decltype(auto)() const { return 10l; } // OK: deduced return type
};

Note: a conversion function template is not allowed to have a deduced return type.

(since C++14)

Conversion functions can be inherited and can be virtual, but cannot be static. A conversion function in the derived class does not hide a conversion function in the base class unless they are converting to the same type.

Conversion function can be a template member function, for example, std::auto_ptr<T>::operator auto_ptr<Y>. See member template and template argument deduction for applicable special rules.
