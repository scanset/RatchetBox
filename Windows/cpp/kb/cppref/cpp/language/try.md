An exception thrown in a try block can possibly be handled by an associated handler.

### Syntax

try compound-statement handler-seq

(1)

try ctor-initializer ﻿(optional) compound-statement handler-seq

(2)

1) An ordinary try block.

2) A function try block. compound-statement must be the compound statement component of a function body.

compound-statement

-

a compound statement

handler-seq

-

a non-empty sequence of handlers

ctor-initializer

-

member initializer list (for constructors only)

### Ordinary try block

An ordinary try block is a statement.

If an exception is thrown from its compound-statement, the exception will be matched against the handlers in its handler-seq ﻿:

void f()
{
throw 1; // NOT handled by the handler below
try
{
throw 2; // handled by the associated handler
}
catch (...)
{
// handles the exception 2
}
throw 3; // NOT handled by the handler above
}

### Function try block

A function try block is a special kind of function body.

If an exception is thrown from its compound-statement or ctor-initializer (if any), the exception will be matched against the handlers in its handler-seq ﻿:

int f(bool cond)
{
if (cond)
throw 1;
return 0;
}
 
struct X
{
int mem;
 
X() try : mem(f(true)) {}
catch (...)
{
// handles the exception 1
}
 
X(int) try
{
throw 2;
}
catch (...)
{
// handles the exception 2
}
};

Exceptions thrown in destructors of objects with static storage duration or in constructors of objects associated with non-block variables with static storage duration are not caught by a function try block on the main function.

Exceptions thrown in destructors of objects with thread storage duration or in constructors of objects associated with non-block variables with thread storage duration are not caught by a function try block on the initial function of the thread.

(since C++11)

Flowing off the end of the compound-statement of a handler of a function try block is equivalent to flowing off the end of the compound-statement of that function try block, unless the function is a constructor or destructor (see below).

#### Constructor and destructor try block

For a class C, if the function body of its constuctor or destructor definition is a function try block, and an exception is thrown during the initialization or destruction, respectively, of C’s subobjects, the exception will also be matched against the handlers in the handler-seq ﻿ of the function try block:

int f(bool cond = true)
{
if (cond)
throw 1;
return 0;
}
 
struct X
{
int mem = f();
 
~X()
{
throw 2;
}
};
 
struct Y
{
X mem;
 
Y() try {}
catch (...)
{
// handles the exception 1
}
 
~Y() try {}
catch (...)
{
// handles the exception 2
}
};

Referring to any non-static member or base class of an object in the handler for a function try block of a constructor or destructor for that object results in undefined behavior.

If a return statement appears in a handler of the function try block of a constructor, the program is ill-formed.

The currently handled exception is rethrown if control reaches the end of a handler of the function try block of a constructor or destructor.

### Control flow

The compound-statement of a try block is a control-flow-limited statement:

void f()
{
goto label; // error
try
{
goto label; // OK
label: ;
}
catch (...)
{
goto label; // error
}
}

A jump statement (goto, break, return, continue) can be used to transfer control out of a try block (including its handlers). When this happens, each variable declared in the try block will be destroyed in the context that directly contains its declaration:

try
{
T1 t1;
try
{
T2 t2;
goto label; // destroy t2 first, then t1
}
catch(...)
{
// executed if an exception is thrown while destroying t2
}
}
catch(...)
{
// executed if an exception is thrown while destroying t1
}
label: ;
