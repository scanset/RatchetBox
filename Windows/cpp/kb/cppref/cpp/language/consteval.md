- consteval - specifies that a function is an immediate function, that is, every call to the function must produce a compile-time constant

### Explanation

The consteval specifier declares a function or function template to be an immediate function, that is, every potentially-evaluated call to the function must (directly or indirectly) produce a compile time constant expression.

An immediate function is a constexpr function, subject to its requirements as the case may be. Same as constexpr, a consteval specifier implies inline. However, it may not be applied to destructors, allocation functions, or deallocation functions.

A function or function template declaration specifying consteval may not also specify constexpr, and any redeclarations of that function or function template must also specify consteval.

A potentially-evaluated invocation of an immediate function whose innermost non-block scope is not a function parameter scope of an immediate function or the true-branch of a consteval if statement(since C++23) must produce a constant expression; such an invocation is known as an immediate invocation.

consteval int sqr(int n)
{
return n*n;
}
constexpr int r = sqr(100); // OK
 
int x = 100;
int r2 = sqr(x); // Error: Call does not produce a constant
 
consteval int sqrsqr(int n)
{
return sqr(sqr(n)); // Not a constant expression at this point, but OK
}
 
constexpr int dblsqr(int n)
{
return 2 * sqr(n); // Error: Enclosing function is not consteval
// and sqr(n) is not a constant
}

An identifier expression that denotes an immediate function may only appear within a subexpression of an immediate invocation or within an immediate function context (i.e. a context mentioned above, in which a call to an immediate function needs not to be a constant expression). A pointer or reference to an immediate function can be taken but cannot escape constant expression evaluation:

consteval int f() { return 42; }
consteval auto g() { return &f; }
consteval int h(int (*p)() = g()) { return p(); }
constexpr int r = h(); // OK
constexpr auto e = g(); // ill-formed: a pointer to an immediate function is
// not a permitted result of a constant expression

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
 
// This function might be evaluated at compile-time, if the input
// is known at compile-time. Otherwise, it is executed at run-time.
constexpr unsigned factorial(unsigned n)
{
return n < 2 ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1);
}
 
// With consteval we enforce that the function will be evaluated at compile-time.
consteval unsigned combination(unsigned m, unsigned n)
{
return factorial(n) / factorial(m) / factorial(n - m);
}
 
static_assert(factorial(6) == 720);
static_assert(combination(4, 8) == 70);
 
int main(int argc, const char*[])
{
constexpr unsigned x{factorial(4)};
std::cout << x << '\n';
 
[[maybe_unused]]
unsigned y = factorial(argc); // OK
// unsigned z = combination(argc, 7); // error: 'argc' is not a constant expression
}

Output:

24
