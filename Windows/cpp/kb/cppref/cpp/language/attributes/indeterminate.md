Indicates that the variable or function parameter has an indeterminate value if it is not initialized.

### Syntax

[[indeterminate]]

### Explanation

[[indeterminate]] can be applied to the definition of a block variable with automatic storage duration or to a declaration of a parameter of a function declaration. The attribute specifies that the bytes comprising the storage of an object with automatic storage duration is initially indeterminate rather than erroneous.

If a function parameter is declared with [[indeterminate]], it must be declared in the first declaration of its function. If a function parameter is declared with [[indeterminate]] in the first declaration of its function in one translation unit and the same function is declared without [[indeterminate]] on the same parameter in its first declaration in another translation unit, the program is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.

### Notes

The [[indeterminate]] attribute restores the undefined behavior that was implicitly introduced until C++26. It may make compilers consider a code path reading an indeterminate value unreachable.

### Example

Run this code

void f(int);
 
void g()
{
int x [[indeterminate]]; // indeterminate value
int y; // erroneous value
 
f(x); // undefined behavior
f(y); // erroneous behavior
}
 
struct T
{
T() {}
int x;
};
 
void h(T a [[indeterminate]], T b)
{
f(a.x); // undefined behavior when called below
f(b.x); // erroneous behavior when called below
}
 
h(T(), T());
