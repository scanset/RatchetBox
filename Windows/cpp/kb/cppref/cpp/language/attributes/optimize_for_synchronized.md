Indicates that the function definition should be optimized for invocation from a synchronized statement.

### Syntax

[[optimize_for_synchronized]]

### Explanation

Applies to the name being declared in a function declaration, which must be the first declaration of the function.

Indicates that the function definition should be optimized for invocation from a synchronized statement. In particular, it avoids serializing synchronized blocks that make a call to a function that is transaction-safe for the majority of calls, but not for all calls.
