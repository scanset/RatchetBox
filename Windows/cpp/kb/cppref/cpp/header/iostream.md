This header is part of the Input/output library.

Including <iostream> behaves as if it defines a static storage duration object of type std::ios_base::Init, whose constructor initializes the standard stream objects if it is the first std::ios_base::Init object to be constructed, and whose destructor flushes those objects (except for cin and wcin) if it is the last std::ios_base::Init object to be destroyed.

### Includes

<ios>

(C++11)

std::ios_base class, std::basic_ios class template and typedefs

<streambuf>

(C++11)

std::basic_streambuf class template

<istream>

(C++11)

std::basic_istream class template and typedefs

<ostream>

(C++11)

std::basic_ostream, std::basic_iostream class templates and typedefs

### Objects

cinwcin

reads from the standard C input stream stdin
(global object)

coutwcout

writes to the standard C output stream stdout
(global object)

cerrwcerr

writes to the standard C error stream stderr, unbuffered
(global object)

clogwclog

C++98

the type of the static object was std::basic_ios::Init
(not strictly wrong, but the wording was misleading)

corrected to std::ios_base::Init

LWG 1123

C++98

including <iostream> did not guarantee the
construction of std::ios_base::Init objects
