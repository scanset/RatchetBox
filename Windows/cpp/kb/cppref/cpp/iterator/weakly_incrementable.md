For the definition of /*is-signed-integer-like*/, see is-integer-like ﻿.

This concept specifies requirements on types that can be incremented with the pre- and post-increment operators, but those increment operations are not necessarily equality-preserving, and the type itself is not required to be std::equality_comparable.

For std::weakly_incrementable types, a == b does not imply that ++a == ++b. Algorithms on weakly incrementable types must be single-pass algorithms. These algorithms can be used with istreams as the source of the input data through std::istream_iterator.

### Semantic requirements

For an object i of type I, I models std::weakly_incrementable only if all following conditions are satisfied:

- The expressions ++i and i++ have the same domain.

- If i is incrementable, then both ++i and i++ advance i.

- If i is incrementable, then std::addressof(++i) == std::addressof(i).
