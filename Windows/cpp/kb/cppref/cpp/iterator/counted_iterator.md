Defined in header <iterator>

template< std::input_or_output_iterator I >

class counted_iterator;

(since C++20)

std::counted_iterator is an iterator adaptor which behaves exactly like the underlying iterator, except that it keeps track of the distance to the end of its range. This iterator is equal to std::default_sentinel if and only if its count reaches zero.

### Member objects

Member name

Definition

current (private)

the underlying iterator which base() accesses
(exposition-only member object*)

length (private)

the distance between the underlying iterator and the end of its range
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

(C++20)

constructs a new iterator adaptor 
(public member function)

operator=

(C++20)

assigns another iterator adaptor 
(public member function)

base

(C++20)

accesses the underlying iterator 
(public member function)

count

(C++20)

returns the distance to the end 
(public member function)

operator*operator->

(C++20)

accesses the pointed-to element 
(public member function)

operator[]

(C++20)

accesses an element by index 
(public member function)

operator++operator++(int)operator+=operator+operator--operator--(int)operator-=operator-

(C++20)

advances or decrements the iterator 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator<=>

(C++20)

compares the distances to the end 
(function template)

operator==(std::default_sentinel)

(C++20)

checks if the distance to the end is equal to ​0​ 
(function template)

operator+

(C++20)

advances the iterator 
(function template)

operator-

(C++20)

computes the distance between two iterator adaptors 
(function template)

operator-(std::default_sentinel_t)

(C++20)

computes the signed distance to the end 
(function template)

iter_move

(C++20)

casts the result of dereferencing the underlying iterator to its associated rvalue reference type 
(function)

iter_swap

(C++20)

swaps the objects pointed to by two underlying iterators 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::iterator_traits<std::counted_iterator>

(C++20)

provides uniform interface to the properties of the std::counted_iterator type 
(class template specialization)

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
 
using std::operator""s;
 
void print(auto const remark, auto const& v)
{
const auto size = std::ssize(v);
std::cout << remark << '[' << size << "] { ";
for (auto it = std::counted_iterator{std::cbegin(v), size};
it != std::default_sentinel; ++it)
std::cout << *it << (it.count() > 1 ? ", " : " ");
std::cout << "}\n";
}
 
int main()
{
const auto src = {"Arcturus"s, "Betelgeuse"s, "Canopus"s, "Deneb"s, "Elnath"s};
print("src", src);
std::vector<decltype(src)::value_type> dst;
std::ranges::copy(std::counted_iterator{src.begin(), 3},
std::default_sentinel,
std::back_inserter(dst));
print("dst", dst);
}

Output:

src[5] { Arcturus, Betelgeuse, Canopus, Deneb, Elnath }
dst[3] { Arcturus, Betelgeuse, Canopus }
