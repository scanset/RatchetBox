istreambuf_iterator& operator++();

(1)

/* proxy */ operator++( int );

(2)

Advances the iterator by calling sbuf_->sbumpc() where sbuf_ is the stored pointer to the stream buffer.

The behavior is undefined if the iterator is end-of-stream iterator.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

1) *this

2) A proxy object holding the current character obtained via operator*() and the sbuf_ pointer. Dereferencing a proxy object with operator* yields the stored character.

The name proxy is for exposition only.

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
