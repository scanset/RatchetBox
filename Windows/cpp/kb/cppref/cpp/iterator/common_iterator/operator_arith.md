(exposition only*)

Increments the underlying iterator.

The behavior is undefined if the underlying std::variant member object var does not hold an object of type I, i.e. std::holds_alternative<I>(var) is equal to false.

Let it denote the iterator of type I held by var, that is std::get<I>(var).

1) Pre-increments by one. Equivalent to ++it; return *this;.

2) Post-increments by one:

- Equivalent to: auto tmp = *this; ++*this; return tmp;, if I models forward_iterator.

- Equivalent to: return it++;, if the variable definition auto&& ref = *it++; is well-formed, or either

- std::indirectly_readable<I> or

- std::constructible_from<std::iter_value_t<I>, std::iter_reference_t<I>> or

- std::move_constructible<std::iter_value_t<I>>

is false.

- Equivalent to: postfix_proxy p(**this); ++*this; return p; otherwise, where postfix_proxy is an exposition only helper type (3).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

1) *this

2) A copy of *this that was made before the change, or a result of post-increment of the underlying iterator, or a proxy keeping the value of the current element, as described above.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <initializer_list>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
 
int main()
{
const auto il = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
 
using CI = std::common_iterator<
std::counted_iterator<std::initializer_list<int>::iterator>,
std::default_sentinel_t
>;
 
CI first{std::counted_iterator{std::begin(il), std::ssize(il) - 2}};
 
for (; first != std::default_sentinel; ++first)
std::cout << *first << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

1 2 3 4
