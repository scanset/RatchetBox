template< std::sized_sentinel_for<I> I2, std::sized_sentinel_for<I> S2 >

    requires std::sized_sentinel_for<S, I2>

friend constexpr std::iter_difference_t<I2>

operator-( const common_iterator& x, const std::common_iterator<I2, S2>& y );

(since C++20)

Computes the distance between two iterator adaptors. Two sentinels are considered equal.

Let var denote the underlying std::variant member object in std::common_iterator, the behavior is undefined if either x or y is invalid, i.e.
x.var.valueless_by_exception() | y.var.valueless_by_exception() is true.

This function template is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::common_iterator<I> is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

x, y

-

iterator adaptors to compute the difference of

### Return value

- ​0​ if x.var holds an S object and y.var holds an S2 object, i.e. both of them hold a sentinel.

- Otherwise, alt_x - alt_y, where alt_x and alt_y are the alternatives held by x.var and y.var, respectively (either two iterators or one iterator and one sentinel).

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
 
int main()
{
int a[]{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
 
using CI = std::common_iterator<
std::counted_iterator<int*>,
std::default_sentinel_t
>;
 
CI i1{std::counted_iterator{a + 1, 2}};
CI i2{std::counted_iterator{a, 3}};
CI s1{std::default_sentinel};
CI s2{std::default_sentinel};
 
std::cout << (s2 - s1) << ' '
<< (i2 - i1) << ' '
<< (i1 - s1) << '\n';
}

Output:

0 -1 -2
