constexpr const I& base() const& noexcept;

(since C++20)

constexpr I base() &&;

(2)
(since C++20)

Returns the underlying base iterator.

1) Returns a reference to the underlying iterator.

2) Move constructs the return value from the underlying iterator.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

1) A reference to the underlying iterator. 

2) An iterator move constructed from the underlying iterator.

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions. 

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <type_traits>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
std::vector<int> v{0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
 
std::reverse_iterator<std::vector<int>::iterator> reverse{v.rbegin()};
 
std::counted_iterator counted{reverse, 3};
 
static_assert(std::is_same<
decltype(counted.base()),
std::reverse_iterator<std::vector<int>::iterator> const&
>{});
 
std::cout << "Print with reverse_iterator: ";
for (auto r = counted.base(); r != v.rend(); ++r)
std::cout << *r << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
 
std::cout << "Print with counted_iterator: ";
for (; counted != std::default_sentinel; ++counted)
std::cout << counted[0] << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

Print with reverse_iterator: 4 3 2 1 0
Print with counted_iterator: 4 3 2
