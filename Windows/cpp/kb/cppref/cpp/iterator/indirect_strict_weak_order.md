(since C++20)

The concept indirect_strict_weak_order specifies requirements for algorithms that call strict weak orders as their arguments. The key difference between this concept and std::strict_weak_order is that it is applied to the types that I1 and I2 references, rather than I1 and I2 themselves.

some requirements were defined in terms of
std::iter_value_t<I>& which mishandled projections
resulting in incompatibility with strict weak order F&

indirect_strict_weak_order required F& to satisfy
strict_weak_order with std::iter_common_reference_t<I>
