istream_iterator& operator++();

(1)

istream_iterator operator++( int );

(2)

Reads a value from the underlying stream (using its operator>>) and stores it into the iterator object. If the read fails (the underlying stream's fail() returns true), the iterator becomes the end-of-stream iterator.

The behavior is undefined if the iterator is end-of-stream iterator.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

1) *this

2) An istream_iterator that holds an unchanged value.

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions. 

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

LWG 260

C++98

the return type of operator++(int) was istream_iterator&

corrected to istream_iterator

LWG 788

C++98

the underlying stream's operator void* was
used to determine whether the read fails, but it
was removed by the resolution of LWG issue 468

uses fail() instead

LWG 838

C++98

it was unclear whether end-of-stream iterators can be incremented

the behavior is undefined
