1,2) Constructs the end-of-stream iterator, value-initializes the stored value. This constructor is constexpr if the initializer in the definition auto x = T(); is a constant initializer(since C++11).

3) Initializes the iterator, stores the address of stream in a data member, and performs the first read from the input stream to initialize the cached value data member.

4) Constructs a copy of other. If std::is_trivially_copy_constructible<T>::value is true, this copy constructor is a trivial copy constructor.(since C++11)

### Parameters

stream

-

stream to initialize the istream_iterator with

other

-

another istream_iterator of the same type

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
std::istringstream stream("1 2 3 4 5");
std::copy(
std::istream_iterator<int>(stream),
std::istream_iterator<int>(),
std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, " ")
);
}

Output:

1 2 3 4 5
