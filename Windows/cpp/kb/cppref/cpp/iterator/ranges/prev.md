Call signature

template< std::bidirectional_iterator I >

constexpr I prev( I i );

(1)
(since C++20)

template< std::bidirectional_iterator I >

constexpr I prev( I i, std::iter_difference_t<I> n );

(2)
(since C++20)

template< std::bidirectional_iterator I >

constexpr I prev( I i, std::iter_difference_t<I> n, I bound );

(3)
(since C++20)

Return the nth predecessor of iterator i.

The function-like entities described on this page are algorithm function objects (informally known as niebloids), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.

- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.

- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

i

-

an iterator

n

-

number of elements i should be descended

bound

-

iterator denoting the beginning of the range i points to

### Return value

1) The predecessor of i.

2) The nth predecessor of iterator i.

3) The nth predecessor of iterator i, or the first iterator that compares equal to bound, whichever is first.

### Complexity

1) Constant.

2,3) Constant if I models std::random_access_iterator<I>; otherwise linear.

### Possible implementation

struct prev_fn
{
template<std::bidirectional_iterator I>
constexpr I operator()(I i) const
{
--i;
return i;
}
 
template<std::bidirectional_iterator I>
constexpr I operator()(I i, std::iter_difference_t<I> n) const
{
ranges::advance(i, -n);
return i;
}
 
template<std::bidirectional_iterator I>
constexpr I operator()(I i, std::iter_difference_t<I> n, I bound) const
{
ranges::advance(i, -n, bound);
return i;
}
};
 
inline constexpr auto prev = prev_fn();

### Notes

Although the expression --r.end() often compiles for containers, it is not guaranteed to do so: r.end() is an rvalue expression, and there is no iterator requirement that specifies that decrement of an rvalue is guaranteed to work. In particular, when iterators are implemented as pointers or its operator-- is lvalue-ref-qualified, --r.end() does not compile, while ranges::prev(r.end()) does.

This is further exacerbated by ranges that do not model ranges::common_range. For example, for some underlying ranges, ranges::transform_view::end doesn't have the same return type as ranges::transform_view::begin, and so --r.end() won't compile. This isn't something that ranges::prev can aid with, but there are workarounds.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <vector>
 
int main() 
{
std::vector<int> v{3, 1, 4};
auto pv = std::ranges::prev(v.end(), 2);
std::cout << *pv << '\n';
 
pv = std::ranges::prev(pv, 42, v.begin());
std::cout << *pv << '\n';
}

Output:

1
3
