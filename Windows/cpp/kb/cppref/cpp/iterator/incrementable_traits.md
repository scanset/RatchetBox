(5)
(since C++20)

Computes the associated difference type of the type I, if any. A program may specialize incrementable_traits for a program-defined type.

1) Primary template is an empty struct.

2) Specialization for pointers.

Provides a member type difference_type same as std::ptrdiff_t.

3) Specialization for const-qualified types.

4) Specialization for types that define a public and accessible member type difference_type.

Provides a member type difference_type same as T::difference_type.

5) Specialization for types that do not define a public and accessible member type difference_type but do support subtraction.

Provides a member type difference_type same as std::make_signed_t<decltype(std::declval<T>() - std::declval<T>())>. The implicit expression variations rule (see below) applies to the expression a - b.

### Implicit expression variations

A requires expression that uses an expression that is non-modifying for some constant lvalue operand also requires implicit expression variations.
