void swap( stack& other ) noexcept(/* see below */);

(since C++11)

Exchanges the contents of the container adaptor with those of other. Effectively calls using std::swap;
swap(c, other.c);

### Parameters

other

-

container adaptor to exchange the contents with

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

noexcept specification:  
noexcept(noexcept(swap(c, other.c)))

In the expression above, the identifier swap is looked up in the same manner as the one used by the C++17 std::is_nothrow_swappable trait.

(since C++11)
(until C++17)

noexcept specification:  
noexcept(std::is_nothrow_swappable_v<Container>)

(since C++17)

### Complexity

Same as underlying container (typically constant).

### Notes

Some implementations (e.g. libc++) provide the swap member function as an extension to pre-C++11 modes.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <concepts>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>
#include <vector>
 
template<typename Adaptor>
requires (std::ranges::input_range<typename Adaptor::container_type>)
void print(std::string_view name, const Adaptor& adaptor)
{
struct Printer : Adaptor // to use protected Adaptor::Container c;
{
void print(std::string_view name) const
{
std::cout << name << " [" << std::size(this->c) << "]: ";
for (auto const& elem : this->c)
std::cout << elem << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}
};
 
static_cast<Printer const&>(adaptor).print(name);
}
 
int main()
{
std::vector<std::string> v1{"1","2","3","4"},
v2{"Ɐ","B","Ɔ","D","Ǝ"};
 
std::stack s1(std::move(v1));
std::stack s2(std::move(v2));
 
print("s1", s1);
print("s2", s2);
 
s1.swap(s2);
 
print("s1", s1);
print("s2", s2);
}

Output:

s1 [4]: 4 3 2 1
s2 [5]: Ǝ D Ɔ B Ɐ
s1 [5]: Ǝ D Ɔ B Ɐ
s2 [4]: 4 3 2 1
