    class T,

    class Container = std::deque<T>

> class stack;

The std::stack class is a container adaptor that gives the programmer the functionality of a stack - specifically, a LIFO (last-in, first-out) data structure.

The class template acts as a wrapper to the underlying container - only a specific set of functions is provided. The stack pushes and pops the element from the back of the underlying container, known as the top of the stack.

### Template parameters

T

-

The type of the stored elements. The program is ill-formed if T is not the same type as Container::value_type.

Container

-

The type of the underlying container to use to store the elements. The container must satisfy the requirements of SequenceContainer. Additionally, it must provide the following functions with the usual semantics:

- back(), e.g., std::vector::back(),

- push_back(), e.g., std::deque::push_back(),

- pop_back(), e.g., std::list::pop_back().

The standard containers std::vector (including std::vector<bool>), std::deque and std::list satisfy these requirements. By default, if no container class is specified for a particular stack class instantiation, the standard container std::deque is used.

### Member objects

Member

Description

Container c

the underlying container 
(protected member object)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs the stack 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destructs the stack 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns values to the container adaptor 
(public member function)

#### Element access 

top

accesses the top element 
(public member function)

#### Capacity 

empty

checks whether the container adaptor is empty 
(public member function)

size

returns the number of elements 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

push

inserts element at the top 
(public member function)

push_range

(C++23)

inserts a range of elements at the top 
(public member function)

emplace

(C++11)

constructs element in-place at the top 
(public member function)

pop

removes the top element 
(public member function)

swap

(C++11)

swaps the contents 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator!=operator<operator<=operator>operator>=operator<=>

(C++20)

lexicographically compares the values of two stacks 
(function template)

std::swap(std::stack)

(C++11)

specializes the std::swap algorithm 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::uses_allocator<std::stack>

(C++11)

specializes the std::uses_allocator type trait 
(class template specialization)

std::formatter<std::stack>

(C++23)

formatting support for std::stack 
(class template specialization)
