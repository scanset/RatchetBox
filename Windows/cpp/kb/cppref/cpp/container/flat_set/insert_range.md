template< container-compatible-range<value_type> R >

void insert_range( R&& rg );

(since C++23)

Inserts a copy of each element in the range rg into underlying container c as if by:

for (const auto& e : rg)
c.insert(c.end(), e);

Then, sorts the range of newly inserted elements with respect to compare.
Merges the resulting sorted range and the sorted range of pre-existing elements into a single sorted range.
Finally, erases all but the first element from each group of consecutive equivalent elements.

Each iterator in the range rg is dereferenced exactly once.
The behavior is undefined if rg overlaps with the container.

### Parameters

rg

-

a container compatible range, that is, an input_range whose elements are convertible to T

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

N + M·log(M), where N is size() before the operation and M is ranges::distance(rg).

### Notes

Since insert_range performs an in-place merge operation, that may allocate memory.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <flat_set>
 
void println(auto, auto const& container)
{
for (const auto& elem : container)
std::cout << elem << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
auto container = std::flat_set{1, 3, 2, 4};
const auto rg = {-1, 3, -2};
#ifdef __cpp_lib_containers_ranges
container.insert_range(rg);
#else
container.insert(rg.begin(), rg.end());
#endif
println("{}", container);
}

Output:

-2 -1 1 2 3 4
