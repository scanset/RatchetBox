~unordered_multiset();

(since C++11)

A destructor. 
Destructs the unordered_multiset. The destructors of the elements are called and the used storage is deallocated. Note, that if the elements are pointers, the pointed-to objects are not destroyed.

### Complexity

Linear in the size of the unordered_multiset.
