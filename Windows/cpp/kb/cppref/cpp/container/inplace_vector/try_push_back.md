constexpr pointer try_push_back( const T& value );

(1)
(since C++26)

constexpr pointer try_push_back( T&& value );

(2)
(since C++26)

Conditionally appends the given element value to the end of the container.

If size() == capacity() is true, there are no effects. Otherwise, appends an object of type T:

1) The new element is initialized as a copy of value.

2) value is moved into the new element.

No iterators or references are invalidated, except end(), which is invalidated if the insertion occurs.

### Parameters

value

-

the value of the element to append

Type requirements

-

T must meet the requirements of EmplaceConstructible.

### Return value

std::addressof(back()) if size() < capacity(), nullptr otherwise.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown by initialization of inserted element.

If an exception is thrown for any reason, these functions have no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <inplace_vector>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::inplace_vector<std::string, 2> pets;
std::string dog{"dog"};
 
std::string* p1 = pets.try_push_back("cat"); // overload (1)
assert(*p1 == "cat" and pets.size() == 1);
 
std::string* p2 = pets.try_push_back(std::move(dog)); // overload (2)
assert(*p2 == "dog" and pets.size() == 2);
 
assert(pets[0] == "cat" and pets[1] == "dog");
assert(pets.size() == pets.capacity());
 
std::string* p3 = pets.try_push_back("bug");
assert(p3 == nullptr and pets.size() == 2);
}
