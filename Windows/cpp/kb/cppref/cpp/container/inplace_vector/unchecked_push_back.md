constexpr reference unchecked_push_back( const T& value );

(1)
(since C++26)

constexpr reference unchecked_push_back( T&& value );

(2)
(since C++26)

Appends the given element value to the end of the container.

Equivalent to: return *try_push_back(std::forward<decltype(value)>(value));

1) The new element is initialized as a copy of value.

2) value is moved into the new element.

Before the call to these functions size() < capacity() must be true. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

No iterators or references are invalidated, except end(), which is invalidated if the insertion occurs.

### Parameters

value

-

the value of the element to append

Type requirements

-

T must meet the requirements of CopyInsertable in order to use overload (1).

-

T must meet the requirements of MoveInsertable in order to use overload (2).

### Return value

back(), i.e. a reference to the inserted element.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown by initialization of inserted element.

If an exception is thrown for any reason, these functions have no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

Reason: Explain the purpose of this API.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <inplace_vector>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
std::inplace_vector<std::string, 2> fauna;
std::string dog{"dog"};
 
auto& r1 = fauna.unchecked_push_back("cat"); // overload (1)
assert(r1 == "cat" and fauna.size() == 1);
auto& r2 = fauna.unchecked_push_back(std::move(dog)); // overload (2)
assert(r2 == "dog" and fauna.size() == 2);
assert(fauna[0] == "cat" and fauna[1] == "dog");
// fauna.unchecked_push_back("bug"); // undefined behavior: there is no space
}
