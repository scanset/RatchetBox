static constexpr void reserve( size_type new_cap );

(since C++26)

Does nothing, except that may throw std::bad_alloc. The request to increase the capacity (i.e., the internal storage size) is ignored because std::inplace_vector<T, N> is a fixed-capacity container.

### Parameters

new_cap

-

new capacity of the inplace_vector, in number of elements

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

std::bad_alloc if new_cap > capacity() is true.

### Notes

This function exists for compatibility with vector-like interfaces.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <inplace_vector>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::inplace_vector<int, 4> v{1, 2, 3};
assert(v.capacity() == 4 && v.size() == 3);
 
v.reserve(2); // does nothing
assert(v.capacity() == 4 && v.size() == 3);
 
try
{
v.reserve(13); // throws, because requested capacity > N; v is left unchanged
}
catch(const std::bad_alloc& ex)
{
std::cout << ex.what() << '\n';
}
assert(v.capacity() == 4 && v.size() == 3);
}

Possible output:

std::bad_alloc
