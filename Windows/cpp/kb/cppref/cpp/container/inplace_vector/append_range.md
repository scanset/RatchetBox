template< container-compatible-range<T> R >

constexpr void append_range( R&& rg );

(since C++26)

Inserts copies of elements from the range rg before end(), in non-reversing order.

Each iterator in rg is dereferenced exactly once.

### Parameters

rg

-

a container compatible range, that is, an input_range whose elements are convertible to T

Type requirements

-

T must be EmplaceConstructible into inplace_vector from *ranges::begin(rg). Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Linear in size of rg. The number of calls to the constructor of T is exactly equal to the std::ranges::size(rg)).

### Exceptions

Throws std::bad_alloc if std::ranges::size(rg) > N.
If an exception is thrown other than by the copy constructor, move constructor, assignment operator, or move assignment operator of T or by any InputIterator operation, there are no effects.
Otherwise, if an exception is thrown, then size() >= n and elements in the range [​0​, n) are not modified,
where n is the value of size() before this call.

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <inplace_vector>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
using I = std::inplace_vector<int, 8>;
auto head = I{1, 2, 3, 4};
const auto tail = {-5, -6, -7};
head.append_range(tail);
assert(head.size() == 7 and (head == I{1, 2, 3, 4, -5, -6, -7}));
try
{
head.append_range(tail); // throws: no space
}
catch(const std::bad_alloc&)
{
std::cout << "std::bad_alloc\n";
}
}

Output:

std::bad_alloc
