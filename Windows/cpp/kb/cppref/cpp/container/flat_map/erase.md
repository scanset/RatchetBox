iterator erase( iterator position );

(1)
(since C++23)

iterator erase( const_iterator pos );

(2)
(since C++23)

iterator erase( const_iterator first, const_iterator last );

(3)
(since C++23)

size_type erase( const Key& key );

(4)
(since C++23)

template< class K >

size_type erase( K&& x );

(5)
(since C++23)

Removes specified elements from the container. 

1,2) Removes the element at pos. 

3) Removes the elements in the range [first, last), which must be a valid range in *this.

4) Removes the element (if one exists) with the key equivalent to key.

5) Removes all elements with key that compares equivalent to the value x. This overload participates in overload resolution only if the qualified-id Compare::is_transparent is valid and denotes a type, and neither iterator nor const_iterator is implicitly convertible from K. It allows calling this function without constructing an instance of Key.

The iterator pos must be valid and dereferenceable. Thus the end() iterator (which is valid, but is not dereferenceable) cannot be used as a value for pos.

### Parameters

pos

-

iterator to the element to remove

first, last

-

range of elements to remove

key

-

key value of the elements to remove

x

-

a value of any type that can be transparently compared with a key denoting the elements to remove

### Return value

1-3) Iterator following the last removed element.

4) Number of elements removed (0 or 1).

5) Number of elements removed.

### Exceptions

1-3) Throws nothing.

4,5) Any exceptions thrown by the Compare object.

### Complexity

Depends on underlying containers. Typically linear. | This section is incomplete
Reason: revision required

### Example

Run this code

#include <flat_map>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::flat_map<int, std::string> c =
{
{1, "one"}, {2, "two"}, {3, "three"},
{4, "four"}, {5, "five"}, {6, "six"}
};
 
// erase all odd numbers from c
for (auto it = c.begin(); it != c.end();)
{
if (it->first % 2 != 0)
it = c.erase(it);
else
++it;
}
 
for (auto& p : c)
std::cout << p.second << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

two four six
