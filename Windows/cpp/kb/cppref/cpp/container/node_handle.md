template</* unspecified */>

class /*node-handle*/;

(since C++17) 
(exposition only*)

Associative containers std::set, std::map, std::multiset, std::multimap, std::unordered_set, std::unordered_map, std::unordered_multiset, std::unordered_multimap are node-based data structures, and their nodes can be extracted as an object of unspecified type known as node handle.

Node handle is a move-only type that owns and provides access to the element (the value_type) stored in the node, and provides non-const access to the key part of the element (the key_type) and the mapped part of the element (the mapped_type). If the node handle destructs while holding the node, the node is properly destructed using the appropriate allocator for the container. The node handle contains a copy of the container’s allocator. This is necessary so that the node handle can outlive the container.

The exact type of node handle (shown here as /*node-handle*/) is unspecified, but each container exposes its node handle type as the member node_type.

Node handles can be used to transfer ownership of an element between two associative containers with the same key, value, and allocator type (ignoring comparison or hash/equality), without invoking any copy/move operations on the container element (this kind of operation is known as "splicing"). Transfer between unique and non-unique containers is also permitted: a node handle from a std::map can be inserted into an std::multimap, but not into std::unordered_map or std::set.

A node handle may be empty, in which case it holds no element and no allocator. The default-constructed and moved-from node handle is empty. In addition, an empty node handle can be produced by a failed call to container member function extract.

Pointers and references to an element that are obtained while it is owned by a node handle are invalidated if the element is successfully inserted into a container.

For all map containers (std::map, std::multimap, std::unordered_map, and std::unordered_multimap) whose key_type is K and mapped_type is T, the behavior of operations involving node handles is undefined if a user-defined specialization of std::pair exists for std::pair<K, T> or std::pair<const K, T>.

### Member functions

## constructors

constexpr /*node-handle*/() noexcept;

(1)

/*node-handle*/(/*node-handle*/&& nh) noexcept;

(2)

1) The default constructor initializes the node handle to the empty state.

2) The move constructor takes ownership of the container element from nh, move-constructs the member allocator, and leaves nh in the empty state.

### Parameters

nh

-

a node handle with the same type (not necessarily the same container)

### Notes

Node handles are move-only, the copy constructor is not defined.

## operator=

/*node-handle*/& operator=(/*node-handle*/&& nh);

- If the node handle is not empty, 

- destroys the value_type subobject in the container element object managed by this node handle by calling ator_traits::destroy;

- deallocates the container element by calling ator_traits::rebind_traits</*container-node-type*/>::deallocate;

- Acquires ownership of the container element from nh;

- If node handle was empty (and so did not contain an allocator) or if ator_traits::propagate_on_container_move_assignment is true, move-assigns the allocator from nh;

- sets nh to the empty state.

The behavior is undefined if the node is not empty and ator_traits::propagate_on_container_move_assignment is false and the allocators do not compare equal.

### Parameters

nh

-

node handle with the same type (not necessarily the same container)

### Return

*this

### Exceptions

Throws nothing.

### Notes

Node handles are move-only, the copy assignment is not defined.

## destructor

~/*node-handle*/();

- If the node handle is not empty, 

- destroys the value_type subobject in the container element object managed by this node handle by calling ator_traits::destroy;

- deallocates the container element by calling ator_traits::rebind_traits</*container-node-type*/>::deallocate.

## empty

bool empty() const noexcept;

Returns true if the node handle is empty, false otherwise.

## operator bool

explicit operator bool() const noexcept;

Converts to false if the node handle is empty, true otherwise.

## get_allocator

allocator_type get_allocator() const;

Returns a copy of the stored allocator (which is a copy of the allocator of the source container). The behavior is undefined if the node handle is empty.

### Exceptions

Throws nothing.

## value

value_type& value() const;

(set containers only)

Returns a reference to the value_type subobject in the container element object managed by this node handle. The behavior is undefined if the node handle is empty.

### Exceptions

Throws nothing.

## key

key_type& key() const;

(map containers only)

Returns a non-const reference to the key_type member of the value_type subobject in the container element object managed by this node handle. The behavior is undefined if the node handle is empty.

### Exceptions

Throws nothing.

### Notes

This function makes it possible to modify the key of a node extracted from a map, and then re-insert it into the map, without ever copying or moving the element.

## mapped

mapped_type& mapped() const;

(map containers only)

Returns a reference to the mapped_type member of the value_type subobject in the container element object managed by this node handle. The behavior is undefined if the node handle is empty.

### Exceptions

Throws nothing.

## swap

void swap(/*node-handle*/& nh) noexcept(/* see below */);

- swaps ownership of container nodes;

- if one node is empty or if both nodes are non-empty and ator_traits::propagate_on_container_swap is true, swaps the allocators as well.

The behavior is undefined if both nodes are not empty and ator_traits::propagate_on_container_swap is false and the allocators do not compare equal.

### Exceptions

noexcept specification:  
noexcept(ator_traits::propagate_on_container_swap::value

         ator_traits::is_always_equal::value)

### Non-member functions

## swap

friend void swap(/*node-handle*/& x, /*node-handle*/& y) noexcept(noexcept(x.swap(y)));

Effectively executes x.swap(y).

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when node-handle is an associated class of the arguments.
