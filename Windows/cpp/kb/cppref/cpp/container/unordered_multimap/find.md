1,2) Finds an element with key equivalent to key. If there are several elements with the requested key in the container, any of them may be returned.

3,4) Finds an element with key that compares equivalent to the value x. This overload participates in overload resolution only if Hash::is_transparent and KeyEqual::is_transparent are valid and each denotes a type. This assumes that such Hash is callable with both K and Key type, and that the KeyEqual is transparent, which, together, allows calling this function without constructing an instance of Key.

### Parameters

key

-

key value of the element to search for

x

-

a value of any type that can be transparently compared with a key

### Return value

An iterator to the requested element. If no such element is found, past-the-end (see end()) iterator is returned.

### Complexity

Constant on average, worst case linear in the size of the container.

__cpp_lib_generic_unordered_lookup

(C++20)
Heterogeneous comparison lookup in unordered associative containers; overloads (3,4)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
 
int main()
{
// Simple comparison demo.
std::unordered_multimap<int, char> example{{1, 'a'}, {2, 'b'}};
 
if (auto search = example.find(2); search != example.end())
std::cout << "Found " << search->first << ' ' << search->second << '\n';
else
std::cout << "Not found\n";
}

Output:

Found 2 b
