void rehash( size_type count );

(since C++11)

Changes the number of buckets to a value n that is not less than count and satisfies n >= size() / max_load_factor(), then rehashes the container, i.e. puts the elements into appropriate buckets considering that total number of buckets has changed.

### Parameters

count

-

lower bound for the new number of buckets

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Average case linear in the size of the container, worst case quadratic.

### Notes

rehash(0) may be used to force an unconditional rehash, such as after suspension of automatic rehashing by temporarily increasing max_load_factor().

reserve

reserves space for at least the specified number of elements and regenerates the hash table
