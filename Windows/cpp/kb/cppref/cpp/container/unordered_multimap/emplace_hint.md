template< class... Args >

iterator emplace_hint( const_iterator hint, Args&&... args );

(since C++11)

Inserts a new element into the container, using hint as a suggestion where the element should go.

The constructor of the element type (value_type, that is, std::pair<const Key, T>) is called with exactly the same arguments as supplied to the function, forwarded with std::forward<Args>(args)....

If after the operation the new number of elements is greater than old max_load_factor() * bucket_count() a rehashing takes place.
If rehashing occurs (due to the insertion), all iterators are invalidated. Otherwise (no rehashing), iterators are not invalidated.

### Parameters

hint

-

iterator, used as a suggestion as to where to insert the new element

args

-

arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

### Return value

An iterator to the inserted element.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Complexity

Amortized constant on average, worst case linear in the size of the container.
