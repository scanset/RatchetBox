1,2) Returns an iterator pointing to the first element that is not less than (i.e. greater or equal to) key.

3,4) Returns an iterator pointing to the first element that compares not less (i.e. greater or equal) to the value x. This overload participates in overload resolution only if the qualified-id Compare::is_transparent is valid and denotes a type. It allows calling this function without constructing an instance of Key.

### Parameters

key

-

key value to compare the elements to

x

-

alternative value that can be compared to Key

### Return value

Iterator pointing to the first element that is not less than key. If no such element is found, a past-the-end iterator (see end()) is returned.

### Complexity

Logarithmic in the size of the container.
