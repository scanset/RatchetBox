template< class... Args >

iterator emplace( Args&&... args );

(since C++23)

Inserts a new element into the container constructed in-place with the given args.

First, initializes an object t of type value_type with std::forward<Args>(args)..., then inserts t as if by auto it = ranges::upper_bound(c, t, compare);
c.insert(it, std::move(t));

This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_constructible_v<value_type, Args...> is true.

Careful use of emplace allows the new element to be constructed while avoiding unnecessary copy or move operations.

### Parameters

args

-

arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

### Return value

An iterator to the inserted element.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Complexity

Logarithmic in the size of the container.
