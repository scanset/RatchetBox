(since C++11)

Moves elements from another forward_list to *this. The elements are inserted after the element pointed to by pos.

No elements are copied. No iterators or references become invalidated. The iterators to the moved elements now refer into *this, not into other.

1,2) Moves all elements from other into *this. The container other becomes empty after the operation.

3,4) Moves the element pointed to by the iterator following it from other into *this. Has no effect if pos == it or if pos == ++it.

5,6) Moves the elements in the range (first, last) from other into *this. The element pointed-to by first is not moved.

The behavior is undefined if

- get_allocator() != other.get_allocator(),

- pos is neither before_begin() nor a dereferenceable iterator in [begin(), end()),

- for overloads (1,2), *this and other refer to the same object,

- for overloads (3,4), the iterator following it is not a dereferenceable iterator into other, or

- for overloads (5,6),

- (first, last) is not a valid range in other,

- some iterators in (first, last) are not dereferenceable, or

- pos is in (first, last).

### Parameters

pos

-

element after which the content will be inserted

other

-

another container to move the content from

it

-

iterator preceding the iterator to the element to move from other to *this

first, last

-

the range of elements to move from other to *this

### Exceptions

Throws nothing.

### Complexity

1,2) Linear in the size of other.

3,4) Constant.

5,6) Linear in std::distance(first, last).

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <forward_list>
 
int main()
{
using F = std::forward_list<int>;
 
// Demonstrate the meaning of open range (first, last)
// in overload (5): the first element of l1 is not moved.
F l1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
F l2 = {10, 11, 12};
 
l2.splice_after(l2.cbegin(), l1, l1.cbegin(), l1.cend());
// Not equivalent to l2.splice_after(l2.cbegin(), l1);
// which is equivalent to
// l2.splice_after(l2.cbegin(), l1, l1.cbefore_begin(), l1.end());
 
assert((l1 == F{1}));
assert((l2 == F{10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12}));
 
// Overload (1)
F x = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
F y = {10, 11, 12};
x.splice_after(x.cbegin(), y);
assert((x == F{1, 10, 11, 12, 2, 3, 4, 5}));
assert((y == F{}));
 
// Overload (3)
x = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
y = {10, 11, 12};
x.splice_after(x.cbegin(), y, y.cbegin());
assert((x == F{1, 11, 2, 3, 4, 5}));
assert((y == F{10, 12}));
 
// Overload (5)
x = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
y = {10, 11, 12};
x.splice_after(x.cbegin(), y, y.cbegin(), y.cend());
assert((x == F{1, 11, 12, 2, 3, 4, 5}));
assert((y == F{10}));
}

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

DR

Behavior as published

Correct behavior

LWG 2045

C++11

O(1) splicing could not be guaranteed if
get_allocator() != other.get_allocator()

the behavior is
undefined in this case

LWG 2222

C++11

the element pointed to by it is not moved, but pointers, references and
iterators referring to it would refer to an element in *this after splicing

still refer to the
element in other
