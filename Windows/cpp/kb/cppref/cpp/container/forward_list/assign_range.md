template< container-compatible-range<T> R >

void assign_range( R&& rg );

(since C++23)

Replaces elements in the container with a copy of each element in rg.

All iterators (including the end() iterator) and all references to the elements are invalidated.

Each iterator in the range rg is dereferenced exactly once.

The behavior is undefined if rg overlaps with the container.

### Parameters

rg

-

an input_range with reference type convertible to the element type of the container

Type requirements

-

std::assignable_from<T&, ranges::range_reference_t<R>> must be modeled. Otherwise, the program is ill-formed.

-

T must be EmplaceConstructible into the container from *ranges::begin(rg). Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

### Return value

(none)

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <forward_list>
#include <list>
 
int main()
{
const auto source = std::list{2, 7, 1};
auto destination = std::forward_list{3, 1, 4};
#ifdef __cpp_lib_containers_ranges
destination.assign_range(source);
#else
destination.assign(source.cbegin(), source.cend());
#endif
assert(std::ranges::equal(source, destination));
}
