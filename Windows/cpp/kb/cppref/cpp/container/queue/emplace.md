template< class... Args >

void emplace( Args&&... args );

(since C++11) 
(until C++17)

template< class... Args >

decltype(auto) emplace( Args&&... args );

(since C++17)

Pushes a new element to the end of the queue. The element is constructed in-place, i.e. no copy or move operations are performed. The constructor of the element is called with exactly the same arguments as supplied to the function.

Effectively calls c.emplace_back(std::forward<Args>(args)...);.

### Parameters

args

-

arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

### Return value

(none)

(until C++17)

The value or reference, if any, returned by the above call to Container::emplace_back.

(since C++17)

### Complexity

Identical to the complexity of Container::emplace_back.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
 
struct S
{
int id;
 
S(int i, double d, std::string s) : id{i}
{
std::cout << "S::S(" << i << ", " << d << ", \"" << s << "\");\n";
}
};
 
int main()
{
std::queue<S> queue;
const S& s = queue.emplace(42, 3.14, "C++"); // for return value C++17 required
std::cout << "id = " << s.id << '\n';
}

Output:

S::S(42, 3.14, "C++")
id = 42
