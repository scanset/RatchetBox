void clear();

(noexcept since C++11)

Erases all elements from the container. After this call, size() returns zero.

Invalidates any references, pointers, and iterators referring to contained elements.
Any past-the-end iterator remains valid.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Linear in the size of the container, i.e., the number of elements.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
#include <map>
 
void print_info(std::string_view rem, const std::map<int, char>& v)
{
std::cout << rem << "{ ";
for (const auto& [key, value] : v)
std::cout << '[' << key << "]:" << value << ' ';
std::cout << "}\n";
std::cout << "Size=" << v.size() << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
std::map<int, char> container{{1, 'x'}, {2, 'y'}, {3, 'z'}};
print_info("Before clear: ", container);
container.clear();
print_info("After clear: ", container);
}

Output:

Before clear: { [1]:x [2]:y [3]:z }
Size=3
After clear: { }
Size=0
