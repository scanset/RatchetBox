void pop_front();

Removes the first element of the container. If there are no elements in the container, the behavior is undefined.

Iterators and references to the erased element are invalidated. If the element is the last element in the container, the end() iterator is also invalidated. Other references and iterators are not affected.

### Parameters

### Return value

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

### Example

Run this code

#include <deque>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
std::deque<char> chars{'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'};
 
for (; !chars.empty(); chars.pop_front())
std::cout << "chars.front(): '" << chars.front() << "'\n";
}

Output:

chars.front(): 'A'
chars.front(): 'B'
chars.front(): 'C'
chars.front(): 'D'
