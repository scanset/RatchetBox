Defined in header <mdspan>

template< std::size_t PaddingValue = std::dynamic_extent >

struct layout_right_padded;

(since C++26)

Every specialization of layout_right_padded is a LayoutMappingPolicy which provides a layout mapping that is similar to layout_right::mapping except that it has a padding stride.

Every specialization of layout_right_padded is TriviallyCopyable, and std::is_trivially_default_constructible_v<T> is true for any such specialization T.

Let m be the instance of the mapping type layout_right_padded::mapping. The padding stride of the mapping is the second to last stride m.stride(rank() - 2) which is guaranteed to be at least the last extent value m.extent(rank() - 1), called extent to pad.
