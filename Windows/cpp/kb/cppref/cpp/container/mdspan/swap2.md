friend constexpr void swap( mdspan& x, mdspan& y ) noexcept;

(since C++23)

Overloads the std::swap algorithm for std::mdspan. Exchanges the state of x with that of y. Equivalent to:

std::swap(x.acc_, y.acc_);

std::swap(x.map_, y.map_);

std::swap(x.ptr_, y.ptr_);

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::mdspan is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters
