struct layout_right;

(since C++23)

layout_right is a LayoutMappingPolicy which provides a layout mapping where the rightmost extent has stride 1, and strides increase right-to-left as the product of extents.

layout_right is a TrivialType.

(until C++26)

layout_right is TriviallyCopyable, and std::is_trivially_default_constructible_v<layout_right> is true.

(since C++26)

It is the default layout mapping policy used by std::mdspan if no user-specified layout is provided.
