template< class... Args >

iterator emplace_hint( const_iterator hint, Args&&... args );

(since C++11)

Inserts a new element into the container as close as possible to the position just before hint.

The constructors of the key and mapped value are called with exactly the same arguments as supplied to the function, forwarded with std::forward<Args>(args)....

No iterators or references are invalidated.

### Parameters

hint

-

iterator to the position before which the new element will be inserted

args

-

arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

### Return value

An iterator to the inserted element.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Complexity

Logarithmic in the size of the container in general, but amortized constant if the new element is inserted just before hint.
