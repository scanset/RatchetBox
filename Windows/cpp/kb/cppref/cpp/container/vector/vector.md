(11)
(since C++11)

Constructs a new vector from a variety of data sources, optionally using a user supplied allocator alloc.

1) The default constructor since C++11. Constructs an empty vector with a default-constructed allocator.

If Allocator is not DefaultConstructible, the behavior is undefined.

2) The default constructor until C++11. Constructs an empty vector with the given allocator alloc.

3) Constructs a vector with count default-inserted objects of T. No copies are made.

If T is not DefaultInsertable into std::vector<T>, the behavior is undefined.

4) Constructs a vector with count copies of elements with value value.

If T is not CopyInsertable into std::vector<T>, the behavior is undefined.

(since C++11)

5) Constructs a vector with the contents of the range [first, last). Each iterator in [first, last) is dereferenced exactly once.

If InputIt does not satisfy the requirements of LegacyInputIterator, overload (4) is called instead with arguments static_cast<size_type>(first), last and alloc.

(until C++11)

This overload participates in overload resolution only if InputIt satisfies the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined:

- T is not EmplaceConstructible into std::vector<T> from *first.

- Iter does not satisfy the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator, and T is not MoveInsertable into std::vector<T>.

(since C++11)

6) Constructs a vector with the contents of the range rg. Each iterator in rg is dereferenced exactly once.

If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined:

- T is not EmplaceConstructible into std::vector<T> from *ranges::begin(rg).

- R models neither sized_range nor forward_range, and T is not MoveInsertable into std::vector<T>.

7-10) Constructs a vector with the contents of other.

7) The copy constructor.

The allocator is obtained as if by calling std::allocator_traits<Allocator>::
    select_on_container_copy_construction
        (other.get_allocator()).

(since C++11)

8) The move constructor. The allocator is obtained by move construction from other.get_allocator().

9) Same as the copy constructor, except that alloc is used as the allocator.

If T is not CopyInsertable into std::vector<T>, the behavior is undefined.

10) Same as the move constructor, except that alloc is used as the allocator.

If T is not MoveInsertable into std::vector<T>, the behavior is undefined.

11) Equivalent to vector(il.begin(), il.end(), alloc).

### Parameters

alloc

-

allocator to use for all memory allocations of this container

count

-

the size of the container

value

-

the value to initialize elements of the container with

first, last

-

the range to copy the elements from

other

-

another container to be used as source to initialize the elements of the container with

init

-

initializer list to initialize the elements of the container with

rg

-

a container compatible range

### Complexity

1,2) Constant.

3,4) Linear in count.

5) Given std::distance(first, last) as N:

- If first and last are both forward, bidirectional or random-access iterators,

- The copy constructor of T is only called N  times, and

- No reallocation occurs.

- Otherwise (first and last are just input iterators),

- The copy constructor of T is called O(N) times, and

- Reallocation occurs O(log N) times.

6) Given ranges::distance(rg) as N:

- If R models ranges::forward_range or ranges::sized_range,

- Initializes exactly N elements from the result of dereferencing successive iterators of rg, and

- No reallocation occurs.

- Otherwise (R models input range),

- The copy or move constructor of T is called O(N) times, and

- Reallocation occurs O(log N) times.

7) Linear in other.size().

8) Constant.

9) Linear in other.size().

10) Linear in other.size() if alloc != other.get_allocator(), otherwise constant.

11) Linear in init.size().

### Exceptions

Calls to Allocator::allocate may throw.

### Notes

After container move construction (overload (8)), references, pointers, and iterators (other than the end iterator) to other remain valid, but refer to elements that are now in *this. The current standard makes this guarantee via the blanket statement in [container.reqmts]/67, and a more direct guarantee is under consideration via LWG issue 2321.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
 
template<typename T>
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& s, const std::vector<T>& v)
{
s.put('{');
for (char comma[]{'\0', ' ', '\0'}; const auto& e : v)
s << comma << e, comma[0] = ',';
return s << "}\n";
}
 
int main()
{
// C++11 initializer list syntax:
std::vector<std::string> words1{"the", "frogurt", "is", "also", "cursed"};
std::cout << "1: " << words1;
 
// words2 == words1
std::vector<std::string> words2(words1.begin(), words1.end());
std::cout << "2: " << words2;
 
// words3 == words1
std::vector<std::string> words3(words1);
std::cout << "3: " << words3;
 
// words4 is {"Mo", "Mo", "Mo", "Mo", "Mo"}
std::vector<std::string> words4(5, "Mo");
std::cout << "4: " << words4;
 
const auto rg = {"cat", "cow", "crow"};
#ifdef __cpp_lib_containers_ranges
std::vector<std::string> words5(std::from_range, rg); // overload (6)
#else
std::vector<std::string> words5(rg.begin(), rg.end()); // overload (5)
#endif
std::cout << "5: " << words5;
}

Output:

1: {the, frogurt, is, also, cursed}
2: {the, frogurt, is, also, cursed}
3: {the, frogurt, is, also, cursed}
4: {Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo}
5: {cat, cow, crow}
