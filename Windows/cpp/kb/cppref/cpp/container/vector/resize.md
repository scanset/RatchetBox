void resize( size_type count );

(1)
(constexpr since C++20)

void resize( size_type count, const value_type& value );

(2)
(constexpr since C++20)

Resizes the container to contain count elements, does nothing if count == size().

If the current size is greater than count, the container is reduced to its first count elements.

If the current size is less than count, then:

1) Additional default-inserted elements are appended.

2) Additional copies of value are appended.

### Parameters

count

-

new size of the container

value

-

the value to initialize the new elements with

Type requirements

-

T must meet the requirements of MoveInsertable and DefaultInsertable in order to use overload (1).

-

T must meet the requirements of CopyInsertable in order to use overload (2).

### Complexity

Linear in the difference between the current size and count. Additional complexity possible due to reallocation if capacity is less than count.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown for any reason, these functions have no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).
Although not explicitly specified, std::length_error is thrown if the capacity required by the new vector would exceed max_size().

In overload (1), if T's move constructor is not noexcept and T is not CopyInsertable into *this, vector will use the throwing move constructor. If it throws, the guarantee is waived and the effects are unspecified.

(since C++11)

### Notes

If value-initialization in overload (1) is undesirable, for example, if the elements are of non-class type and zeroing out is not needed, it can be avoided by providing a custom Allocator::construct.

Vector capacity is never reduced when resizing to smaller size because that would invalidate all iterators, rather than only the ones that would be invalidated by the equivalent sequence of pop_back() calls.

### Example

Run this code

#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
 
void print(auto rem, const std::vector<int>& c)
{
for (std::cout << rem; const int el : c)
std::cout << el << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
std::vector<int> c = {1, 2, 3};
print("The vector holds: ", c);
 
c.resize(5);
print("After resize up to 5: ", c);
 
c.resize(2);
print("After resize down to 2: ", c);
 
c.resize(6, 4);
print("After resize up to 6 (initializer = 4): ", c);
}

Output:

The vector holds: 1 2 3
After resize up to 5: 1 2 3 0 0
After resize down to 2: 1 2
After resize up to 6 (initializer = 4): 1 2 4 4 4 4

C++11

elements were removed by using pop_back()[2]
due to the resolution of LWG 2033

does not specify the method
of removing elements

- ↑ erase() can remove elements in the middle of a vector, so the value type is required to be MoveAssignable so that the elements following the removed section can be moved forward to fill the gap. However, resize() can only remove elements at the end of the vector, making the MoveAssignable unnecessary.

- ↑ Removing elements by using pop_back() implies that the elements are required to be removed from back to front.
