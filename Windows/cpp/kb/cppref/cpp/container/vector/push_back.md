void push_back( const T& value );

(1)
(constexpr since C++20)

void push_back( T&& value );

(2)
(since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++20)

Appends the given element value to the end of the container.

1) The new element is initialized as a copy of value.

2) value is moved into the new element.

If after the operation the new size() is greater than old capacity() a reallocation takes place, in which case all iterators (including the end() iterator) and all references to the elements are invalidated. Otherwise only the end() iterator is invalidated.

### Parameters

value

-

the value of the element to append

Type requirements

-

T must meet the requirements of CopyInsertable in order to use overload (1).

-

T must meet the requirements of MoveInsertable in order to use overload (2).

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Amortized constant.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown (which can be due to Allocator::allocate() or element copy/move constructor/assignment), this function has no effect (strong exception guarantee).

If the move constructor of T is not noexcept and T is not CopyInsertable into *this, vector will use the throwing move constructor. If it throws, the guarantee is waived and the effects are unspecified.

(since C++11)

### Notes

Some implementations throw std::length_error when push_back causes a reallocation that exceeds max_size (due to an implicit call to an equivalent of reserve(size() + 1)).

### Example

Run this code

#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
std::vector<std::string> letters;
 
letters.push_back("abc");
std::string s{"def"};
letters.push_back(std::move(s));
 
std::cout << "std::vector letters holds: ";
for (auto&& e : letters)
std::cout << std::quoted(e) << ' ';
 
std::cout << "\nMoved-from string s holds: " << std::quoted(s) << '\n';
}

Possible output:

std::vector letters holds: "abc" "def"
Moved-from string s holds: ""
