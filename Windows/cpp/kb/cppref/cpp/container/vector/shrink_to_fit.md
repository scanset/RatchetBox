void shrink_to_fit();

(constexpr since C++20)

Requests the removal of unused capacity.

It is a non-binding request to reduce capacity() to size(). It depends on the implementation whether the request is fulfilled. 

If reallocation occurs, all iterators (including the end() iterator) and all references to the elements are invalidated. If no reallocation occurs, no iterators or references are invalidated.

If T is not MoveInsertable into std::vector<T, Allocator>, the behavior is undefined.

(since C++11)

### Complexity

At most linear in the size of the container.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown other than by the move constructor of a non-CopyInsertable T, there are no effects.

(since C++11)

### Notes

In libstdc++, shrink_to_fit() is not available in C++98 mode.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
std::vector<int> v;
std::cout << "Default-constructed capacity is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
v.resize(100);
std::cout << "Capacity of a 100-element vector is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
v.resize(50);
std::cout << "Capacity after resize(50) is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
v.shrink_to_fit();
std::cout << "Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
v.clear();
std::cout << "Capacity after clear() is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
v.shrink_to_fit();
std::cout << "Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
for (int i = 1000; i < 1300; ++i)
v.push_back(i);
std::cout << "Capacity after adding 300 elements is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
v.shrink_to_fit();
std::cout << "Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
}

Possible output:

Default-constructed capacity is 0
Capacity of a 100-element vector is 100
Capacity after resize(50) is 100
Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is 50
Capacity after clear() is 50
Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is 0
Capacity after adding 300 elements is 512
Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is 300

std::vector lacked explicit shrink-to-fit operations

provided

LWG 2033

LWG 2223

C++98
C++11

1. references, pointers, and iterators were not invalidated (C++98)
2. there was no exception safety guarantee (C++11)

1. they may be invalidated
2. added
