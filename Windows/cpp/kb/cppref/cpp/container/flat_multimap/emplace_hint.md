template< class... Args >

iterator emplace_hint( const_iterator hint, Args&&... args );

(since C++23)

Inserts a new element into the container as close as possible to the position just before hint.

The constructor of the element type (value_type, that is, std::pair<const Key, T>) is called with exactly the same arguments as supplied to the function, forwarded with std::forward<Args>(args)....
