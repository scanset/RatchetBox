template< class... Args >

reference emplace_front( Args&&... args );

(since C++17)

Inserts a new element to the beginning of the container. The element is constructed through std::allocator_traits::construct, which typically uses placement-new to construct the element in-place at the location provided by the container. The arguments args... are forwarded to the constructor as std::forward<Args>(args)....

No iterators or references are invalidated.

### Parameters

args

-

arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

Type requirements

-

T (the container's element type) must meet the requirements of EmplaceConstructible.

### Return value

(none)
(until C++17)

A reference to the inserted element.
(since C++17)

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).
