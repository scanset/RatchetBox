template< container-compatible-range<T> R >

void append_range( R&& rg );

(since C++23)

Inserts copies of elements from the range rg before end(), in non-reversing order.

No iterators or references are invalidated.

Each iterator in rg is dereferenced exactly once.

### Parameters

rg

-

a container compatible range, that is, an input_range whose elements are convertible to T

Type requirements

-

T must be EmplaceConstructible into list from *ranges::begin(rg). Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Linear in size of rg. The number of calls to the constructor of T is exactly equal to the std::ranges::size(rg)).

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Example

Run this code

#include <cassert>
#include <list>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
auto head = std::list{1, 2, 3, 4};
const auto tail = std::vector{-5, -6, -7};
#ifdef __cpp_lib_containers_ranges
head.append_range(tail);
#else
head.insert(head.end(), tail.cbegin(), tail.cend());
#endif
assert((head == std::list{1, 2, 3, 4, -5, -6, -7}));
}
