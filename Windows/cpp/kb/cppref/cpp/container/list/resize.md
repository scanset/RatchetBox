void resize( size_type count );

(1)

void resize( size_type count, const value_type& value );

(2)

Resizes the container to contain count elements, does nothing if count == size().

If the current size is greater than count, the container is reduced to its first count elements.

If the current size is less than count, then:

1) Additional default-inserted elements are appended.

2) Additional copies of value are appended.

### Parameters

count

-

new size of the container

value

-

the value to initialize the new elements with

Type requirements

-

T must meet the requirements of DefaultInsertable in order to use overload (1).

-

T must meet the requirements of CopyInsertable in order to use overload (2).

### Complexity

Linear in the difference between the current size and count. 

### Notes

If value-initialization in overload (1) is undesirable, for example, if the elements are of non-class type and zeroing out is not needed, it can be avoided by providing a custom Allocator::construct.

### Example

Run this code

#include <list>
#include <iostream>
 
void print(auto rem, const std::list<int>& c)
{
for (std::cout << rem; const int el : c)
std::cout << el << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
std::list<int> c = {1, 2, 3};
print("The list holds: ", c);
 
c.resize(5);
print("After resize up to 5: ", c);
 
c.resize(2);
print("After resize down to 2: ", c);
 
c.resize(6, 4);
print("After resize up to 6 (initializer = 4): ", c);
}

Output:

The list holds: 1 2 3
After resize up to 5: 1 2 3 0 0
After resize down to 2: 1 2
After resize up to 6 (initializer = 4): 1 2 4 4 4 4
