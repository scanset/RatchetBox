Defined in header <memory>

template< class T, class Alloc >

struct uses_allocator;

(since C++11)

If T has a nested type allocator_type which is convertible from Alloc, the member constant value is true. Otherwise value is false.

### Helper variable template

template< class T, class Alloc >

constexpr bool uses_allocator_v = uses_allocator<T, Alloc>::value;

(since C++17)

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

value

[static]

true if T uses allocator Alloc, false otherwise 
(public static member constant)

### Member functions

operator bool

converts the object to bool, returns value 
(public member function)

operator()

(C++14)

returns value 
(public member function)

### Member types

Type

Definition

value_type

bool

type

std::integral_constant<bool, value>

### Uses-allocator construction

There are three conventions of passing an allocator alloc to a constructor of some type T:

- If T does not use a compatible allocator (std::uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc> is false), then alloc is ignored.

- Otherwise, std::uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc> is true, and

- if T uses the leading-allocator convention (is invocable as T(std::allocator_arg, alloc, args...)), then uses-allocator construction uses this form.

- if T uses the trailing-allocator convention (is invocable as T(args..., alloc)), then uses-allocator construction uses this form.

- Otherwise, the program is ill-formed (this means std::uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc> is true, but the type does not follow either of the two allowed conventions).

- As a special case, std::pair is treated as a uses-allocator type even though std::uses_allocator is false for pairs (unlike e.g. std::tuple): see pair-specific overloads of std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator::construct and std::scoped_allocator_adaptor::construct(until C++20)std::uses_allocator_construction_args(since C++20).

The utility functions std::make_obj_using_allocator, and std::uninitialized_construct_using_allocator may be used to explicitly create an object following the above protocol, and std::uses_allocator_construction_args can be used to prepare the argument list that matches the flavor of uses-allocator construction expected by the type.

(since C++20)

### Specializations

Given a program-defined type T that does not have a nested allocator_type, a program can specialize std::uses_allocator to derive from std::true_type for T if any of the following requirements is satisfied:

- T has a constructor which takes std::allocator_arg_t as the first argument, and Alloc as the second argument.

- T has a constructor which takes Alloc as the last argument.

In the above, Alloc is a type that satisfies Allocator or is a pointer type convertible to std::experimental::pmr::memory_resource*(library fundamentals TS).

The following specializations are already provided by the standard library:

std::uses_allocator<std::tuple>

(class template specialization)

std::uses_allocator<std::queue>

std::uses_allocator<std::function>

(class template specialization)

std::uses_allocator<std::promise>

(C++11)

(class template specialization)

std::uses_allocator<std::packaged_task>

(C++11) (until C++17)

### Notes

This type trait is used by std::tuple, std::scoped_allocator_adaptor, and std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator. It may also be used by custom allocators or wrapper types to determine whether the object or member being constructed is itself capable of using an allocator (e.g. is a container), in which case an allocator should be passed to its constructor.
