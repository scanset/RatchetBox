Defined in header <memory>

void* align( std::size_t alignment,

             std::size_t size,

             void*& ptr,

std::size_t& space );

(since C++11)

Given a pointer ptr to a buffer of size space, returns a pointer aligned by the specified alignment for size number of bytes and decreases space argument by the number of bytes used for alignment. The first aligned address is returned.

The function modifies the pointer only if it would be possible to fit the wanted number of bytes aligned by the given alignment into the buffer. If the buffer is too small, the function does nothing and returns nullptr.

The behavior is undefined if alignment is not a power of two.

### Parameters

alignment

-

the desired alignment

size

-

the size of the storage to be aligned

ptr

-

pointer to contiguous storage (a buffer) of at least space bytes

space

-

the size of the buffer in which to operate

### Return value

The adjusted value of ptr, or null pointer value if the space provided is too small.

### Example

Demonstrates the use of std::align to place objects of different type in memory.

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
template<std::size_t N>
struct MyAllocator
{
char data[N];
void* p;
std::size_t sz;
MyAllocator() : p(data), sz(N) {}
template<typename T>
T* aligned_alloc(std::size_t a = alignof(T))
{
if (std::align(a, sizeof(T), p, sz))
{
T* result = reinterpret_cast<T*>(p);
p = (char*)p + sizeof(T);
sz -= sizeof(T);
return result;
}
return nullptr;
}
};
 
int main()
{
MyAllocator<64> a;
std::cout << "allocated a.data at " << (void*)a.data
<< " (" << sizeof a.data << " bytes)\n";
 
// allocate a char
if (char* p = a.aligned_alloc<char>())
{
*p = 'a';
std::cout << "allocated a char at " << (void*)p << '\n';
}
 
// allocate an int
if (int* p = a.aligned_alloc<int>())
{
*p = 1;
std::cout << "allocated an int at " << (void*)p << '\n';
}
 
// allocate an int, aligned at 32-byte boundary
if (int* p = a.aligned_alloc<int>(32))
{
*p = 2;
std::cout << "allocated an int at " << (void*)p << " (32 byte alignment)\n";
}
}

Possible output:

allocated a.data at 0x7ffd0b331f80 (64 bytes)
allocated a char at 0x7ffd0b331f80
allocated an int at 0x7ffd0b331f84
allocated an int at 0x7ffd0b331fa0 (32 byte alignment)
