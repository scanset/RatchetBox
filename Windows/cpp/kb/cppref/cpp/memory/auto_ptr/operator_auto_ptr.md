template< class Y >

operator auto_ptr<Y>() throw();

(2)
(deprecated in C++11) 
(removed in C++17)

Converts *this to an auto_ptr for a different type Y.

1) Returns an implementation-defined type that holds a reference to *this. std::auto_ptr is convertible and assignable from this template. The implementation is allowed to provide the template with a different name or implement equivalent functionality in other ways.

2) Constructs a new auto_ptr with a pointer obtained by calling release().

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

1) An implementation-defined type that holds a reference to *this.

2) An auto_ptr with a pointer obtained by calling release().

### Notes

The constructor and the copy assignment operator from auto_ptr_ref is provided to allow copy-constructing and assigning std::auto_ptr from nameless temporaries. Since its copy constructor and copy assignment operator take the argument as non-const reference, they cannot bind rvalue arguments directly. However, a user-defined conversion (1) or (2) can be executed (which releases the original auto_ptr), followed by a call to the constructor or copy-assignment operator that take auto_ptr_ref by value. This is an early implementation of move semantics.
