Defined in header <new>

(1)

struct nothrow_t {};

(until C++11)

struct nothrow_t { explicit nothrow_t() = default; };

(since C++11)

extern const std::nothrow_t nothrow;

(2)

std::nothrow_t is an empty class type used to disambiguate the overloads of throwing and non-throwing allocation functions. std::nothrow is a constant of it.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <new>
 
int main()
{
try
{
while (true)
{
new int[100000000ul]; // throwing overload
}
}
catch (const std::bad_alloc& e)
{
std::cout << e.what() << '\n';
}
 
while (true)
{
int* p = new(std::nothrow) int[100000000ul]; // non-throwing overload
if (p == nullptr)
{
std::cout << "Allocation returned nullptr\n";
break;
}
}
}

Output:

std::bad_alloc
Allocation returned nullptr
