Defined in header <new>

class bad_array_new_length;

(since C++11)

std::bad_array_new_length is the type of the object thrown as exceptions by the new-expressions to report invalid array lengths if

- Array length is negative,

- Total size of the new array would exceed implementation-defined maximum value,

- The number of initializer-clauses exceeds the number of elements to initialize.

Only the first array dimension may generate this exception; dimensions other than the first are constant expressions and are checked at compile time.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new bad_array_new_length object 
(public member function)

operator=

replaces the bad_array_new_length object 
(public member function)

what

returns the explanatory string 
(public member function)

## std::bad_array_new_length::bad_array_new_length

bad_array_new_length() noexcept;

(1)
(since C++11)

bad_array_new_length( const bad_array_new_length& other ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++11)

Constructs a new bad_array_new_length object with an implementation-defined null-terminated byte string which is accessible through what().

1) Default constructor.

2) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::bad_array_new_length then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0.

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to copy

## std::bad_array_new_length::operator=

bad_array_new_length& operator=( const bad_array_new_length& other ) noexcept;

(since C++11)

Assigns the contents with those of other.If *this and other both have dynamic type std::bad_array_new_length then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment.

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to assign with

### Return value

*this

## std::bad_array_new_length::what

virtual const char* what() const noexcept;

(since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++26)

Returns the explanatory string.

### Return value

Pointer to an implementation-defined null-terminated string with explanatory information. The string is suitable for conversion and display as a std::wstring. The pointer is guaranteed to be valid at least until the exception object from which it is obtained is destroyed, or until a non-const member function (e.g. copy assignment operator) on the exception object is called.

The returned string is encoded with the ordinary literal encoding during constant evaluation.

(since C++26)

### Notes

Implementations are allowed but not required to override what().

## Inherited from std::bad_alloc 

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

(destructor)

[virtual]

destroys the exception object 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

### Example

Three conditions where std::bad_array_new_length should be thrown:

Run this code

#include <climits>
#include <iostream>
#include <new>
 
int main()
{
try
{
int negative = -1;
new int[negative];
}
catch (const std::bad_array_new_length& e)
{
std::cout << "1) " << e.what() << ": negative size\n";
}
 
try
{
int small = 1;
new int[small]{1,2,3};
}
catch (const std::bad_array_new_length& e)
{
std::cout << "2) " << e.what() << ": too many initializers\n";
}
 
try
{
long large = LONG_MAX;
new int[large][1000];
} 
catch (const std::bad_array_new_length& e)
{
std::cout << "3) " << e.what() << ": too large\n";
}
 
std::cout << "End\n";
}

Possible output:

1) std::bad_array_new_length: negative size
2) std::bad_array_new_length: too many initializers
3) std::bad_array_new_length: too large
End
