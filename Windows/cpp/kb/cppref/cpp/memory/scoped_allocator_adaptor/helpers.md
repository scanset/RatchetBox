These exposition-only helper member function templates are used in member functions construct() and destroy().

1) Obtains the outermost allocator of alloc.

- If the expression alloc.outer_allocator() is valid, returns outermost ﻿(alloc.outer_allocator()).

- Otherwise, returns alloc.

2,3) Constructs or destroys an object using the outermost allocator of *this.

Given the type std::allocator_traits<std::remove_reference_t<decltype(outermost ﻿())>> as outermost_traits:

2) Equivalent to outermost_traits::construct(outermost ﻿(), p, std::forward<Args>(args)...);.

3) Equivalent to outermost_traits::destroy(outermost ﻿(), p);.
