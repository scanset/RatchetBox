1) Default constructor: value-initializes the OuterAlloc base class and the inner allocator member object, if used by the implementation.

2) Constructs the base class OuterAlloc from std::forward<OuterA2>(outerAlloc), and the inner allocators with innerAllocs.... This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_constructible<OuterAlloc, OuterA2>::value is true.

3) Copy-constructor: initializes each allocator from the corresponding allocator of other.

4) Move-constructor: moves each allocator from the corresponding allocator of other into *this.

5) Initializes each allocator from the corresponding allocator of other. This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_constructible<OuterAlloc, const OuterA2&>::value is true.

6) Initializes each allocator from the corresponding allocator of other, using move semantics. This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_constructible<OuterAlloc, OuterA2>::value is true.

### Parameters

outerAlloc

-

constructor argument for the outer allocator

innerAllocs...

-
