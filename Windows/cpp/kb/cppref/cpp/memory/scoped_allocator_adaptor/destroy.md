Defined in header <scoped_allocator>

template< class T >

void destroy( T* p );

(since C++11)

Uses the outer allocator to call the destructor of the object pointed to by p, by calling

std::allocator_traits<OUTERMOST>::destroy(OUTERMOST(*this), p)

where OUTERMOST is the type that would be returned by calling this->outer_allocator(), and then calling the outer_allocator() member function recursively on the result of this call until reaching the type that has no such member function.

### Parameters

-

pointer to the object that is going to be destroyed

### Return value
