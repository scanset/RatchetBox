template< class U, class E >

unique_ptr& operator=( unique_ptr<U, E>&& r ) noexcept;

unique_ptr& operator=( std::nullptr_t ) noexcept;

(3)

unique_ptr& operator=( const unique_ptr& ) = delete;

(4)

1) Move assignment operator. Transfers ownership from r to *this as if by calling reset(r.release()) followed by assigning get_deleter() from std::forward<Deleter>(r.get_deleter()).

This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_move_assignable<Deleter>::value is true.

If Deleter is not a reference type, the behavior is undefined if

- Deleter is not MoveAssignable, or

- assigning get_deleter() from an rvalue of type Deleter would throw an exception.

Otherwise (Deleter is a reference type), the behavior is undefined if

- std::remove_reference<Deleter>::type is not CopyAssignable, or

- assigning get_deleter() from an lvalue of type Deleter would throw an exception.

2) Converting assignment operator. Transfers ownership from r to *this as if by calling reset(r.release()) followed by assigning get_deleter() from std::forward<E>(r.get_deleter()).

This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

- std::is_assignable<Deleter&, E&&>::value is true.

- For the primary template, all following conditions are satisfied:
U is not an array type.

- unique_ptr<U, E>::pointer is implicitly convertible to pointer, and.

- For the array specialization (unique_ptr<T[]>), all following conditions are satisfied:
U is an array type.

- pointer is the same type as element_type*.

- unique_ptr<U, E>::pointer is the same type as unique_ptr<U, E>::element_type*.

- unique_ptr<U, E>::element_type(*)[] is convertible to element_type(*)[].

If E is not a reference type, the behavior is undefined if assigning get_deleter() from an rvalue of type E is ill-formed or would throw an exception.

Otherwise (E is a reference type), the behavior is undefined if assigning get_deleter() from an lvalue of type E is ill-formed or would throw an exception.

3) Effectively the same as calling reset().

4) Copy assignment operator is explicitly deleted.

### Parameters

r

-

smart pointer from which ownership will be transferred

### Return value

*this

### Notes

As a move-only type, unique_ptr's assignment operator only accepts rvalues arguments (e.g. the result of std::make_unique or a std::move'd unique_ptr variable).

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
struct Foo
{
int id;
Foo(int id) : id(id) { std::cout << "Foo " << id << '\n'; }
~Foo() { std::cout << "~Foo " << id << '\n'; }
};
 
int main() 
{
std::unique_ptr<Foo> p1(std::make_unique<Foo>(1));
 
{
std::cout << "Creating new Foo...\n";
std::unique_ptr<Foo> p2(std::make_unique<Foo>(2));
// p1 = p2; // Error ! can't copy unique_ptr
p1 = std::move(p2);
std::cout << "About to leave inner block...\n";
 
// Foo instance will continue to live, 
// despite p2 going out of scope
}
 
std::cout << "About to leave program...\n";
}

Output:

Foo 1
Creating new Foo...
Foo 2
~Foo 1
About to leave inner block...
About to leave program...
~Foo 2
