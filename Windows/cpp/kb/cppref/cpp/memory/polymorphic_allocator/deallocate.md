void deallocate( T* p, std::size_t n );

(since C++17)

Deallocates the storage pointed to by p, which must have been allocated from a std::pmr::memory_resource x that compares equal to *resource() using x.allocate(n * sizeof(T), alignof(T)).

Equivalent to this->resource()->deallocate(p, n * sizeof(T), alignof(T));.

### Parameters

p

-

pointer to memory to deallocate

n

-

the number of objects originally allocated
