void* allocate_bytes( std::size_t nbytes,

                      std::size_t alignment = alignof(std::max_align_t) );

(since C++20)

Allocates nbytes bytes of storage at specified alignment alignment using the underlying memory resource. Equivalent to return resource()->allocate(nbytes, alignment);.

### Parameters

nbytes

-

the number of bytes to allocate

alignment

-

the alignment to use

### Return value

A pointer to the allocated storage. 

### Notes

This function was introduced for use with the fully-specialized allocator std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<>, but it may be useful in any specialization.

The return type is void* (rather than, e.g., std::byte*) to support conversion to an arbitrary pointer type U* by static_cast<U*>.

### Exceptions

May throw any exceptions thrown by the call to resource()->allocate.
