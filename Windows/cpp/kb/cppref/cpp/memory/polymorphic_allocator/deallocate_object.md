template< class U >

void deallocate_object( U* p, std::size_t n = 1 );

(since C++20)

Deallocates the storage pointed to by p, which must have been allocated from a std::pmr::memory_resource x that compares equal to *resource(), using x.allocate(n * sizeof(U), alignof(U)), typically through a call to allocate_object<U>(n).

Equivalent to deallocate_bytes(p, n * sizeof(U), alignof(U));.

### Parameters

p

-

pointer to memory to deallocate

n

-

number of objects of type U the memory was for

### Exceptions

Throws nothing.

### Notes

This function was introduced for use with the fully-specialized allocator std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<>, but it may be useful in any specialization.
