Compares two polymorphic allocators. Two polymorphic allocators compare equal if their underlying memory resource compares equal.

1) Returns *lhs.resource() == *rhs.resource().

2) Same as (1), allowing conversion to polymorphic_allocator.
This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator is an associated class of the arguments.

3) Returns !(lhs == rhs).

4) Same as (3), allowing conversion to polymorphic_allocator.
This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator is an associated class of the arguments.

The != operator is synthesized from operator==.

(since C++20)
