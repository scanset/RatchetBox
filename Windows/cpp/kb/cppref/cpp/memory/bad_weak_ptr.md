class bad_weak_ptr;

(since C++11)

std::bad_weak_ptr is the type of the object thrown as exceptions by the constructors of std::shared_ptr that take std::weak_ptr as the argument, when the std::weak_ptr refers to an already deleted object.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a new bad_weak_ptr object 
(public member function)

operator=

replaces the bad_weak_ptr object 
(public member function)

what

returns the explanatory string 
(public member function)

## std::bad_weak_ptr::bad_weak_ptr

bad_weak_ptr() noexcept;

(1)
(since C++11)

bad_weak_ptr( const bad_weak_ptr& other ) noexcept;

(2)
(since C++11)

Constructs a new bad_weak_ptr object with an implementation-defined null-terminated byte string which is accessible through what().

1) Default constructor.

2) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type std::bad_weak_ptr then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0.

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to copy

## std::bad_weak_ptr::operator=

bad_weak_ptr& operator=( const bad_weak_ptr& other ) noexcept;

(since C++11)

Assigns the contents with those of other.If *this and other both have dynamic type std::bad_weak_ptr then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment.

### Parameters

other

-

another exception object to assign with

### Return value

*this

## std::bad_weak_ptr::what

virtual const char* what() const noexcept;

(since C++11)

Returns the explanatory string.

### Return value

Pointer to an implementation-defined null-terminated string with explanatory information. The string is suitable for conversion and display as a std::wstring. The pointer is guaranteed to be valid at least until the exception object from which it is obtained is destroyed, or until a non-const member function (e.g. copy assignment operator) on the exception object is called.

The returned string is encoded with the ordinary literal encoding during constant evaluation.

(since C++26)

### Notes

Implementations are allowed but not required to override what().

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

(destructor)

[virtual]

destroys the exception object 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

what

[virtual]

returns an explanatory string 
(virtual public member function of std::exception)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
int main()
{
std::shared_ptr<int> p1(new int(42));
std::weak_ptr<int> wp(p1);
p1.reset();
try
{
std::shared_ptr<int> p2(wp);
}
catch (const std::bad_weak_ptr& e)
{
std::cout << e.what() << '\n';
}
}

Possible output:

std::bad_weak_ptr
