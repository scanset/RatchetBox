Defined in header <memory>

template< class T, class... Args >

constexpr T* construct_at( T* location, Args&&... args );

(since C++20)

Creates a T object initialized with the arguments in args at given address location.

Equivalent to 
if constexpr (std::is_array_v<T>)

    return ::new (voidify ﻿(*location)) T[1]();

else

    return ::new (voidify ﻿(*location)) T(std::forward<Args>(args)...);
, except that construct_at may be used in evaluation of constant expressions(until C++26).

When construct_at is called in the evaluation of some constant expression expr, location must point to either a storage obtained by std::allocator<T>::allocate or an object whose lifetime began within the evaluation of expr.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

- std::is_unbounded_array_v<T> is false.

- ::new(std::declval<void*>()) T(std::declval<Args>()...) is well-formed when treated as an unevaluated operand.

If std::is_array_v<T> is true and sizeof...(Args) is nonzero, the program is ill-formed.

### Parameters

location

-

pointer to the uninitialized storage on which a T object will be constructed

args...

-

arguments used for initialization

### Return value

location

### Example

Run this code

#include <bit>
#include <memory>
 
class S
{
int x_;
float y_;
double z_;
public:
constexpr S(int x, float y, double z) : x_{x}, y_{y}, z_{z} {}
[[nodiscard("no side-effects!")]]
constexpr bool operator==(const S&) const noexcept = default;
};
 
consteval bool test()
{
alignas(S) unsigned char storage[sizeof(S)]{};
S uninitialized = std::bit_cast<S>(storage);
std::destroy_at(&uninitialized);
S* ptr = std::construct_at(std::addressof(uninitialized), 42, 2.71f, 3.14);
const bool res{*ptr == S{42, 2.71f, 3.14}};
std::destroy_at(ptr);
return res;
}
static_assert(test());
 
int main() {}

construct_at could not create objects of array types

can value-initialize bounded arrays
