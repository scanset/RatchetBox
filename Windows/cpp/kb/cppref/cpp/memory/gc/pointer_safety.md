The scoped enumeration type pointer_safety lists the pointer safety modes supported by C++.

### Enumeration constants

pointer_safety::strict

Only safely-derived pointers (pointers to objects allocated with new or subobjects thereof) may be dereferenced or deallocated. Garbage collector may be active.

pointer_safety::preferred

All pointers are considered valid and may be dereferenced or deallocated. A reachability-based leak detector may be active.

pointer_safety::relaxed

All pointers are considered valid and may be dereferenced or deallocated.
