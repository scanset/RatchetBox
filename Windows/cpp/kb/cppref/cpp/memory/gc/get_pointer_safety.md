Defined in header <memory>

std::pointer_safety get_pointer_safety() noexcept;

(since C++11) 
(removed in C++23)

Obtains the implementation-defined pointer safety model, which is a value of type std::pointer_safety.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The pointer safety used by this implementation.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
int main()
{
std::cout << "Pointer safety: ";
switch (std::get_pointer_safety())
{
case std::pointer_safety::strict:
std::cout << "strict\n";
break;
case std::pointer_safety::preferred:
std::cout << "preferred\n";
break;
case std::pointer_safety::relaxed:
std::cout << "relaxed\n";
break;
}
}

Possible output:

Pointer safety: relaxed
