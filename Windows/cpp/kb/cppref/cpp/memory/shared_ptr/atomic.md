If multiple threads of execution access the same std::shared_ptr object without synchronization and any of those accesses uses a non-const member function of shared_ptr then a data race will occur unless all such access is performed through these functions, which are overloads of the corresponding atomic access functions (std::atomic_load, std::atomic_store, etc.).

Note that the control block of a shared_ptr is thread-safe: different std::shared_ptr objects can be accessed using mutable operations, such as operator= or reset, simultaneously by multiple threads, even when these instances are copies, and share the same control block internally.

1) Determines whether atomic access to the shared pointer pointed-to by p is lock-free.

2) Equivalent to atomic_load_explicit(p, std::memory_order_seq_cst).

3) Returns the shared pointer pointed-to by p.

As with the non-specialized std::atomic_load_explicit, if mo is std::memory_order_release or std::memory_order_acq_rel, the behavior is undefined.

4) Equivalent to atomic_store_explicit(p, r, std::memory_order_seq_cst).

5) Stores the shared pointer r in the shared pointer pointed-to by p atomically, as if by p->swap(r).

As with the non-specialized std::atomic_store_explicit, if mo is std::memory_order_acquire or std::memory_order_acq_rel, the behavior is undefined.

6) Equivalent to atomic_exchange_explicit(p, r, std::memory_order_seq_cst).

7) Stores the shared pointer r in the shared pointer pointed to by p and returns the value formerly pointed-to by p, atomically, as if by p->swap(r) and returns a copy of r after the swap.

8) Equivalent to

atomic_compare_exchange_weak_explicit
    (p, expected, desired, std::memory_order_seq_cst,
                           std::memory_order_seq_cst).

9) Equivalent to

atomic_compare_exchange_strong_explicit
    (p, expected, desired, std::memory_order_seq_cst,
                           std::memory_order_seq_cst).

10,11) Compares the shared pointers pointed-to by p and expected.

- If they are equivalent (store the same pointer value, and either share ownership of the same object or are both empty), assigns desired into *p using the memory ordering constraints specified by success and returns true.

- If they are not equivalent, assigns *p into *expected using the memory ordering constraints specified by failure and returns false.

atomic_compare_exchange_weak_explicit may fail spuriously.

If expected is a null pointer, or failure is std::memory_order_release or std::memory_order_acq_rel, the behavior is undefined.

If p is a null pointer, the behaviors of these functions are all undefined.

### Parameters

p, expected

-

a pointer to a std::shared_ptr

r, desired

-

a std::shared_ptr

mo, success, failure

-

memory ordering selectors of type std::memory_order

### Exceptions

These functions do not throw exceptions.

### Return value

1) true if atomic access is implemented using lock-free instructions.

2,3) A copy of the pointed-to shared pointer.

4,5) (none)

6,7) A copy of the formerly pointed-to shared pointer.

8-11) true if the shared pointers were equivalent and the exchange was performed, false otherwise.

### Notes

These functions are typically implemented using mutexes, stored in a global hash table where the pointer value is used as the key.

The Concurrency TS offers atomic smart pointer classes atomic_shared_ptr and atomic_weak_ptr as a replacement for the use of these functions.

These functions were deprecated in favor of the specializations of the std::atomic template: std::atomic<std::shared_ptr> and std::atomic<std::weak_ptr>.

(since C++20)
(until C++26)

These functions were removed in favor of the specializations of the std::atomic template: std::atomic<std::shared_ptr> and std::atomic<std::weak_ptr>.
