shared_ptr& operator=( const shared_ptr& r ) noexcept;

(1)

template< class Y > 

shared_ptr& operator=( const shared_ptr<Y>& r ) noexcept;

(2)

shared_ptr& operator=( shared_ptr&& r ) noexcept;

(3)

template< class Y > 

shared_ptr& operator=( shared_ptr<Y>&& r ) noexcept;

(4)

template< class Y > 

shared_ptr& operator=( std::auto_ptr<Y>&& r );

(5)
(deprecated in C++11) 
(removed in C++17)

template< class Y, class Deleter > 

shared_ptr& operator=( std::unique_ptr<Y, Deleter>&& r );

(6)

Replaces the managed object with the one managed by r.

If *this already owns an object and it is the last shared_ptr owning it, and r is not the same as *this, the object is destroyed through the owned deleter.

1,2) Shares ownership of the object managed by r. If r manages no object, *this manages no object too. Equivalent to shared_ptr<T>(r).swap(*this).

3,4) Move-assigns a shared_ptr from r. After the assignment, *this contains a copy of the previous state of r, and r is empty. Equivalent to shared_ptr<T>(std::move(r)).swap(*this).

5) Transfers the ownership of the object managed by r to *this. If r manages no object, *this manages no object too. After the assignment, *this contains the pointer previously held by r, and use_count() == 1; also r is empty. Equivalent to shared_ptr<T>(r).swap(*this).

6) Transfers the ownership of the object managed by r to *this. The deleter associated to r is stored for future deletion of the managed object. r manages no object after the call. Equivalent to shared_ptr<T>(std::move(r)).swap(*this).

### Parameters

r

-

another smart pointer to share the ownership to or acquire the ownership from

### Return value

*this

### Notes

The implementation may meet the requirements without creating a temporary shared_ptr object.

### Exceptions

5,6) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
