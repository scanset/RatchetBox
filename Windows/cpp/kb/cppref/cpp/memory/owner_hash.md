struct owner_hash;

(since C++26)

This function object provides owner-based (as opposed to value-based) hashing of both std::weak_ptr and std::shared_ptr.

### Nested types

### Member functions

operator()

calculates the hash of the shared-ownership pointer 
(function)

## std::owner_hash::operator()

template< class T >

std::size_t operator()( const std::shared_ptr<T>& key ) const noexcept;

(1)
(since C++26)

template< class T >

std::size_t operator()( const std::weak_ptr<T>& key ) const noexcept;

(2)
(since C++26)

Equivalent to return key.owner_hash();.

### Parameters

key

-

shared-ownership pointer to be hashed

### Return value

A hash value that is identical for any std::shared_ptr or std::weak_ptr object sharing the same ownership.
