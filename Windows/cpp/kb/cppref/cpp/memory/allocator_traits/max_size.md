Defined in header <memory>

static size_type max_size( const Alloc& a ) noexcept;

(since C++11) 
(constexpr since C++20)

If possible, obtains the maximum theoretically possible allocation size from the allocator a, by calling a.max_size().

If the above is not possible (e.g., Alloc does not have the member function max_size()), then returns std::numeric_limits<size_type>::max() / sizeof(value_type).

### Parameters

a

-

allocator to detect

### Return value

Theoretical maximum allocation size.

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

LWG 2466

C++11

theoretical maximum allocation size in bytes was returned as fallback

size in elements is returned

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
std::allocator<short> b;
std::allocator<int> d;
 
const auto p = std::allocator_traits<decltype(b)>::max_size(b);
const auto q = std::allocator_traits<decltype(d)>::max_size(d);
 
std::cout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
std::cout << std::uppercase
<< "p = " << std::dec << p << " = 0x" << std::hex << p << '\n'
<< "q = " << std::dec << q << " = 0x" << std::hex << q << '\n';
}

Possible output:

p = 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 = 0x7,FFF,FFF,FFF,FFF,FFF
q = 4,611,686,018,427,387,903 = 0x3,FFF,FFF,FFF,FFF,FFF
