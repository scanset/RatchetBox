(removed in C++20)

The output iterator std::raw_storage_iterator makes it possible for standard algorithms to store results in uninitialized memory. Whenever the algorithm writes an object of type T to the dereferenced iterator, the object is copy-constructed into the location in the uninitialized storage pointed to by the iterator. The template parameter OutputIt is any type that meets the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator and has operator* defined to return an object, for which operator& returns an object of type T*. Usually, the type T* is used as OutputIt.

### Type requirements

-

OutputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator.

### Member functions

(constructor)

creates a new raw_storage_iterator 
(public member function)

operator=

constructs an object at the pointed-to location in the buffer 
(public member function)

operator*

dereferences the iterator 
(public member function)

operator++operator++(int)

advances the iterator 
(public member function)

base

(since C++17)

provides access to the wrapped iterator 
(public member function)

### Member types

Member type

Definition

iterator_category

std::output_iterator_tag

value_type

void

difference_type

void

(until C++20)

std::ptrdiff_t

(since C++20)

pointer

void

reference

void

Member types iterator_category, value_type, difference_type, pointer and reference are required to be obtained by inheriting from std::iterator<std::output_iterator_tag, void, void, void, void>.

(until C++17)

### Note

std::raw_storage_iterator was deprecated primarily because of its exception-unsafe behavior. Unlike std::uninitialized_copy, it doesn't handle exceptions during operations like std::copy safely, potentially leading to resource leaks due to a lack of tracking the number of successfully constructed objects and their proper destruction in the presence of exceptions.

### Example

Run this code

#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
const std::string s[] = {"This", "is", "a", "test", "."};
std::string* p = std::allocator<std::string>().allocate(5);
 
std::copy(std::begin(s), std::end(s),
std::raw_storage_iterator<std::string*, std::string>(p));
 
for (std::string* i = p; i != p + 5; ++i)
{
std::cout << *i << '\n';
i->~basic_string<char>();
}
std::allocator<std::string>().deallocate(p, 5);
}

Output:

This
is
a
test
.
