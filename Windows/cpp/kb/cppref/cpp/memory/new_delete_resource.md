Defined in header <memory_resource>

std::pmr::memory_resource* new_delete_resource() noexcept;

(since C++17)

Returns a pointer to a memory_resource that uses the global operator new and operator delete to allocate memory.

### Return value 

Returns a pointer p to a static storage duration object of a type derived from std::pmr::memory_resource, with the following properties:

- its allocate() function uses ::operator new to allocate memory;

- its deallocate() function uses ::operator delete to deallocate memory;

- for any memory_resource r, p->is_equal(r) returns &r == p.

The same value is returned every time this function is called.
