void deallocate( void* p,

                 std::size_t bytes,

std::size_t alignment = alignof(std::max_align_t) );

(since C++17)

Deallocates the storage pointed to by p. p shall have been returned by a prior call to allocate(bytes, alignment) on a memory_resource that compares equal to *this, and the storage it points to shall not yet have been deallocated.

Equivalent to do_deallocate(p, bytes, alignment);.
