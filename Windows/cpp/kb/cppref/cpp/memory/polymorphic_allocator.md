(until C++20)

template< class T = std::byte >

class polymorphic_allocator;

(since C++20)

The class template std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator is an Allocator which exhibits different allocation behavior depending upon the std::pmr::memory_resource from which it is constructed. Since memory_resource uses runtime polymorphism to manage allocations, different container instances with polymorphic_allocator as their static allocator type are interoperable, but can behave as if they had different allocator types.

All specializations of polymorphic_allocator meet the allocator completeness requirements.

The polymorphic_allocator::construct member function does uses-allocator construction, so that the elements of a container using a polymorphic_allocator will use that same allocator for their own allocations. For example, a std::pmr::vector<std::pmr::string> will use the same memory_resource for the vector's storage and each string's storage.

For non-polymorphic allocators, similar propagation can be achieved with the help of std::scoped_allocator_adaptor.

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs a polymorphic_allocator 
(public member function)

(destructor)

(implicitly declared)

implicitly declared destructor 
(public member function)

operator=

[deleted]

copy assignment operator is deleted 
(public member function)

#### Public member functions 

allocate

allocate memory 
(public member function)

deallocate

deallocate memory 
(public member function)

construct

constructs an object in allocated storage 
(public member function)

destroy

(deprecated in C++20)(undeprecated in C++26)

destroys an object in allocated storage 
(public member function)

allocate_bytes

(C++20)

allocate raw aligned memory from the underlying resource 
(public member function)

deallocate_bytes

(C++20)

free raw memory obtained from allocate_bytes 
(public member function)

allocate_object

(C++20)

allocates raw memory suitable for an object or an array 
(public member function)

deallocate_object

(C++20)

frees raw memory obtained by allocate_object 
(public member function)

new_object

(C++20)

allocates and constructs an object 
(public member function)

delete_object

(C++20)

destroys and deallocates an object 
(public member function)

select_on_container_copy_construction

create a new polymorphic_allocator for use by a container's copy constructor 
(public member function)

resource

returns a pointer to the underlying memory resource 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

operator==operator!=

(removed in C++20)

compare two polymorphic_allocators 
(function)

### Notes

polymorphic_allocator does not propagate on container copy assignment, move assignment, or swap. As a result, move assignment of a polymorphic_allocator-using container can throw, and swapping two polymorphic_allocator-using containers whose allocators do not compare equal results in undefined behavior.
