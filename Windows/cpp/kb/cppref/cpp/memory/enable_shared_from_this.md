class enable_shared_from_this;

(since C++11)

std::enable_shared_from_this allows an object t that is currently managed by a std::shared_ptr named pt to safely generate additional std::shared_ptr instances pt1, pt2 etc. that all share ownership of t with pt.

Publicly inheriting from std::enable_shared_from_this<T> provides the type T with a member function shared_from_this. If an object t of type T is managed by a std::shared_ptr<T> named pt, then calling T::shared_from_this will return a new std::shared_ptr<T> that shares ownership of t with pt.

### Data members

Member

Description

mutable std::weak_ptr<T> weak_this

the object tracking the control block of the first shared owner of *this
(exposition-only member object*)

### Member functions

(constructor)

constructs an enable_shared_from_this object 
(protected member function)

(destructor)

destroys an enable_shared_from_this object 
(protected member function)

operator=

returns a reference to *this 
(protected member function)

shared_from_this

returns a std::shared_ptr which shares ownership of *this 
(public member function)

weak_from_this

(C++17)

returns a std::weak_ptr which shares ownership of *this 
(public member function)

### Notes

The constructors of std::shared_ptr detect the presence of an unambiguous and accessible (i.e. public inheritance is mandatory) enable_shared_from_this base and assign the newly created std::shared_ptr to weak_this if not already owned by a live std::shared_ptr. Constructing a std::shared_ptr for an object that is already managed by another std::shared_ptr will not consult weak_this and thus will lead to undefined behavior.

It is permitted to call shared_from_this only on a previously shared object, i.e. on an object managed by std::shared_ptr<T>. Otherwise, std::bad_weak_ptr is thrown (by the std::shared_ptr constructor from a default-constructed weak_this ﻿).

enable_shared_from_this provides the safe alternative to an expression like std::shared_ptr<T>(this), which is likely to result in this being destructed more than once by multiple owners that are unaware of each other (see example below).

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
class Good : public std::enable_shared_from_this<Good>
{
public:
std::shared_ptr<Good> getptr()
{
return shared_from_this();
}
};
 
class Best : public std::enable_shared_from_this<Best>
{
struct Private{ explicit Private() = default; };
 
public:
// Constructor is only usable by this class
Best(Private) {}
 
// Everyone else has to use this factory function
// Hence all Best objects will be contained in shared_ptr
static std::shared_ptr<Best> create()
{
return std::make_shared<Best>(Private());
}
 
std::shared_ptr<Best> getptr()
{
return shared_from_this();
}
};
 
struct Bad
{
std::shared_ptr<Bad> getptr()
{
return std::shared_ptr<Bad>(this);
}
~Bad() { std::cout << "Bad::~Bad() called\n"; }
};
 
void testGood()
{
// Good: the two shared_ptr's share the same object
std::shared_ptr<Good> good0 = std::make_shared<Good>();
std::shared_ptr<Good> good1 = good0->getptr();
std::cout << "good1.use_count() = " << good1.use_count() << '\n';
}
 
void misuseGood()
{
// Bad: shared_from_this is called without having std::shared_ptr owning the caller
try
{
Good not_so_good;
std::shared_ptr<Good> gp1 = not_so_good.getptr();
}
catch (std::bad_weak_ptr& e)
{
// undefined behavior (until C++17) and std::bad_weak_ptr thrown (since C++17)
std::cout << e.what() << '\n';
}
}
 
void testBest()
{
// Best: Same but cannot stack-allocate it:
std::shared_ptr<Best> best0 = Best::create();
std::shared_ptr<Best> best1 = best0->getptr();
std::cout << "best1.use_count() = " << best1.use_count() << '\n';
 
// Best stackBest; // <- Will not compile because Best::Best() is private.
}
 
void testBad()
{
// Bad, each shared_ptr thinks it is the only owner of the object
std::shared_ptr<Bad> bad0 = std::make_shared<Bad>();
std::shared_ptr<Bad> bad1 = bad0->getptr();
std::cout << "bad1.use_count() = " << bad1.use_count() << '\n';
} // UB: double-delete of Bad
 
int main()
{
testGood();
misuseGood();
 
testBest();
 
testBad();
}

Possible output:

good1.use_count() = 2
bad_weak_ptr
best1.use_count() = 2
bad1.use_count() = 1
Bad::~Bad() called
Bad::~Bad() called
