void reset() noexcept;

(since C++11)

Releases the reference to the managed object. After the call *this manages no object.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

(none)

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
int main()
{
auto shared = std::make_shared<int>(), shared2 = shared, shared3 = shared2;
 
auto weak = std::weak_ptr<int>{shared};
 
std::cout << std::boolalpha 
<< "shared.use_count(): " << shared.use_count() << '\n'
<< "weak.use_count(): " << weak.use_count() << '\n'
<< "weak.expired(): " << weak.expired() << '\n';
 
weak.reset();
 
std::cout << "weak.reset();\n"
<< "shared.use_count(): " << shared.use_count() << '\n'
<< "weak.use_count(): " << weak.use_count() << '\n'
<< "weak.expired(): " << weak.expired() << '\n';
}

Output:

shared.use_count(): 3
weak.use_count(): 3
weak.expired(): false
weak.reset();
shared.use_count(): 3
weak.use_count(): 0
weak.expired(): true
