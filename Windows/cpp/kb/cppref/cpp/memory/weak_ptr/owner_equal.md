template< class Y >

bool owner_equal( const std::shared_ptr<Y>& other ) const noexcept;

(2)
(since C++26)

Checks whether this weak_ptr and other share ownership or are both empty. The comparison is such that two smart pointers compare equivalent only if they are both empty or if they both own the same object, even if the values of the pointers obtained by get() are different (e.g. because they point at different subobjects within the same object).

The member function owner_equal is an equivalence relation such that !owner_before(other) && !other.owner_before(*this) is true if and only if owner_equal(other) is true.

This ordering is used to make shared and weak pointers usable as keys in unordered associative containers, typically through std::owner_equal.

### Parameters

other

-

the std::shared_ptr or std::weak_ptr to be compared

### Return value

true if *this and other share ownership or are both empty. Otherwise, returns false.
