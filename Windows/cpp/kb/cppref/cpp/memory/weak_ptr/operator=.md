(5)
(since C++11)

Replaces the managed object with the one managed by r. The object is shared with r. If r manages no object, *this manages no object too. 

1-3) Equivalent to std::weak_ptr<T>(r).swap(*this).

4,5) Equivalent to std::weak_ptr<T>(std::move(r)).swap(*this).

### Parameters

r

-

smart pointer to share an object with

### Return value

*this

### Notes

The implementation may meet the requirements without creating a temporary weak_ptr object.
