bool expired() const noexcept;

(since C++11)

Equivalent to use_count() == 0. The destructor for the managed object may not yet have been called, but this object's destruction is imminent (or may have already happened).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

true if the managed object has already been deleted, false otherwise.

### Notes

If the managed object is shared among threads, it is only meaningful when expired() returns true.

### Example

Demonstrates how expired is used to check validity of the pointer.

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
std::weak_ptr<int> gw;
 
void f()
{
if (!gw.expired())
std::cout << "gw is valid\n";
else
std::cout << "gw is expired\n";
}
 
int main()
{
{
auto sp = std::make_shared<int>(42);
gw = sp;
 
f();
}
 
f();
}

Output:

gw is valid
gw is expired
