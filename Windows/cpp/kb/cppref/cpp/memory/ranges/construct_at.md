Defined in header <memory>

Call signature

template< class T, class... Args >

constexpr T* construct_at( T* location, Args&&... args );

(since C++20)

Creates a T object initialized with the arguments in args at given address location.

Equivalent to 
if constexpr (std::is_array_v<T>)

    return ::new (voidify ﻿(*location)) T[1]();

else

    return ::new (voidify ﻿(*location)) T(std::forward<Args>(args)...);
, except that construct_at may be used in evaluation of constant expressions(until C++26).

When construct_at is called in the evaluation of some constant expression expr, location must point to either a storage obtained by std::allocator<T>::allocate or an object whose lifetime began within the evaluation of expr.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

- std::is_unbounded_array_v<T> is false.

- ::new(std::declval<void*>()) T(std::declval<Args>()...) is well-formed when treated as an unevaluated operand.

If std::is_array_v<T> is true and sizeof...(Args) is nonzero, the program is ill-formed.

The function-like entities described on this page are algorithm function objects (informally known as niebloids), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.

- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.

- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

location

-

pointer to the uninitialized storage on which a T object will be constructed

args...

-

arguments used for initialization

### Return value

location

### Notes

std::ranges::construct_at behaves exactly same as std::construct_at, except that it is invisible to argument-dependent lookup.

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
struct S
{
int x;
float y;
double z;
 
S(int x, float y, double z) : x{x}, y{y}, z{z} { std::cout << "S::S();\n"; }
 
~S() { std::cout << "S::~S();\n"; }
 
void print() const
{
std::cout << "S { x=" << x << "; y=" << y << "; z=" << z << "; };\n";
}
};
 
int main()
{
alignas(S) unsigned char buf[sizeof(S)];
 
S* ptr = std::ranges::construct_at(reinterpret_cast<S*>(buf), 42, 2.71828f, 3.1415);
ptr->print();
 
std::ranges::destroy_at(ptr);
}

Output:

S::S();
S { x=42; y=2.71828; z=3.1415; };
S::~S();
