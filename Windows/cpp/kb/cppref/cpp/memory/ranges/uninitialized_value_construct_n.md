Defined in header <memory>

Call signature

template< no-throw-forward-iterator I >

    requires std::default_initializable<std::iter_value_t<I>>

I uninitialized_value_construct_n( I first,

std::iter_difference_t<I> count );

(since C++20) 
(constexpr since C++26)

Constructs objects of type std::iter_value_t<I> in the uninitialized memory area first + [​0​, count) by value-initialization, as if by
return ranges::uninitialized_value_construct(std::counted_iterator(first, count),
                                             std::default_sentinel).base();

If an exception is thrown during the initialization, the objects already constructed are destroyed in an unspecified order.

The function-like entities described on this page are algorithm function objects (informally known as niebloids), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.

- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.

- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

first

-

the beginning of the range of elements to initialize

count

-

the number of elements to construct

### Return value

As described above.

### Complexity

Linear in count.

### Exceptions

Any exception thrown on construction of the elements in the destination range.

### Notes

An implementation may improve the efficiency of the ranges::uninitialized_value_construct_n, e.g. by using ranges::fill_n, if the value type of the range is a CopyAssignable TrivialType.

### Possible implementation

struct uninitialized_value_construct_n_fn
{
template<no-throw-forward-iterator I>
requires std::default_initializable<std::iter_value_t<I>>
constexpr I operator()(I first, std::iter_difference_t<I> count) const
{
auto iter = std::counted_iterator(first, count);
return ranges::uninitialized_value_construct(iter, std::default_sentinel).base();
}
};
 
inline constexpr uninitialized_value_construct_n_fn uninitialized_value_construct_n{};

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
struct S { std::string m{"█▓▒░ █▓▒░ █▓▒░ "}; };
 
constexpr int n{4};
alignas(alignof(S)) char out[n * sizeof(S)];
 
try
{
auto first{reinterpret_cast<S*>(out)};
auto last = std::ranges::uninitialized_value_construct_n(first, n);
 
auto count{1};
for (auto it{first}; it != last; ++it)
std::cout << count++ << ' ' << it->m << '\n';
 
std::ranges::destroy(first, last);
}
catch (...)
{
std::cout << "Exception!\n";
}
 
// For scalar types, uninitialized_value_construct_n
// zero-initializes the given uninitialized memory area.
int v[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
std::cout << ' ';
for (const int i : v)
std::cout << i << ' ';
std::cout << "\n ";
std::ranges::uninitialized_value_construct_n(std::begin(v), std::size(v));
for (const int i : v)
std::cout << i << ' ';
std::cout << '\n';
}

Output:

1 █▓▒░ █▓▒░ █▓▒░ 
2 █▓▒░ █▓▒░ █▓▒░ 
3 █▓▒░ █▓▒░ █▓▒░ 
4 █▓▒░ █▓▒░ █▓▒░
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
