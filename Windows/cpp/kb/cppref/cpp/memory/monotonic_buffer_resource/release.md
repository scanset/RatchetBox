void release();

(since C++17)

Releases all allocated memory by calling the deallocate function on the upstream memory resource as necessary. Resets current buffer and next buffer size to their initial values at construction.

Memory is released back to the upstream resource even if deallocate has not been called for some of the allocated blocks.
