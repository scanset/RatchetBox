(since C++11)

std::weak_ptr is a smart pointer that holds a non-owning ("weak") reference to an object that is managed by std::shared_ptr. It must be converted to std::shared_ptr in order to access the referenced object.

std::weak_ptr models temporary ownership: when an object needs to be accessed only if it exists, and it may be deleted at any time by someone else, std::weak_ptr is used to track the object, and it is converted to std::shared_ptr to acquire temporary ownership. If the original std::shared_ptr is destroyed at this time, the object's lifetime is extended until the temporary std::shared_ptr is destroyed as well.

Another use for std::weak_ptr is to break reference cycles formed by objects managed by std::shared_ptr. If such cycle is orphaned (i.e., there are no outside shared pointers into the cycle), the shared_ptr reference counts cannot reach zero and the memory is leaked. To prevent this, one of the pointers in the cycle can be made weak.

### Member functions

(constructor)

creates a new weak_ptr 
(public member function)

(destructor)

destroys a weak_ptr 
(public member function)

operator=

assigns the weak_ptr 
(public member function)

#### Modifiers 

reset

releases the ownership of the managed object 
(public member function)

swap

swaps the managed objects 
(public member function)

#### Observers 

use_count

returns the number of shared_ptr objects that manage the object 
(public member function)

expired

checks whether the referenced object was already deleted 
(public member function)

lock

creates a shared_ptr that manages the referenced object 
(public member function)

owner_before

provides owner-based ordering of weak pointers 
(public member function)

owner_hash

(C++26)

provides owner-based hashing of weak pointers

owner_equal

(C++26)

provides owner-based equal comparison of weak pointers 
(public member function)

### Non-member functions

std::swap(std::weak_ptr)

(C++11)

specializes the std::swap algorithm 
(function template)

### Helper classes

std::atomic<std::weak_ptr>

(C++20)

atomic weak pointer 
(class template specialization)

### Deduction guides (since C++17)

### Notes

Like std::shared_ptr, a typical implementation of weak_ptr stores two pointers:

- a pointer to the control block; and

- the stored pointer of the shared_ptr it was constructed from.

A separate stored pointer is necessary to ensure that converting a shared_ptr to weak_ptr and then back works correctly, even for aliased shared_ptrs. It is not possible to access the stored pointer in a weak_ptr without locking it into a shared_ptr.

### Example

Demonstrates how lock is used to ensure validity of the pointer.

Run this code

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
std::weak_ptr<int> gw;
 
void observe()
{
std::cout << "gw.use_count() == " << gw.use_count() << "; ";
// we have to make a copy of shared pointer before usage:
if (std::shared_ptr<int> spt = gw.lock())
std::cout << "*spt == " << *spt << '\n';
else
std::cout << "gw is expired\n";
}
 
int main()
{
{
auto sp = std::make_shared<int>(42);
gw = sp;
 
observe();
}
 
observe();
}

Output:

gw.use_count() == 1; *spt == 42
gw.use_count() == 0; gw is expired
