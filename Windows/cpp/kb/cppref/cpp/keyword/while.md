### Usage

- while loop: as the declaration of the loop

- do-while loop: as the declaration of the terminating condition of the loop

### Example

Run this code

#include <iostream>
 
int main() noexcept
{
int i{3};
 
// The following 'while' loop statement:
// 1. (condition) Checks if value of the variable 'i' is greater than zero
// and if not, ends the loop execution with end of this point.
// Post-decrements the variable 'i' (decreases its value by 1).
// 2. (statement) Writes out a current value of the variable 'i' to the stdout.
// 3. Returns to the point 1 (condition).
 
while (i --> 0) // condition: i-- > 0
std::cout << i; // statement: std::cout << i;
}

Output:

210
