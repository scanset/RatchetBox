Call signature

execution::sender auto just_error( auto&& error );

(since C++26)

A sender factory that returns a sender which completes immediately by calling the receiver’s set_error().

Let e be a subexpression represented by an input error which will be injected and returned by the receiver. The expression just_error(e) is expression-equivalent to /*make-sender*/(just_error, /*product-type*/(e))

### Customization point objects

The name execution::just_error denotes a customization point object, which is a const function object of a literal semiregular class type. The cv-unqualified version of its type is a tag type denoted as execution::just_error_t.

All instances of execution::just_error_t are equal. The effects of invoking different instances of type execution::just_error_t on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be invocable). Thus, execution::just_error can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to execution::just_error above, execution::just_error_t models

- std::invocable<execution::just_error_t, Args...>,

- std::invocable<const execution::just_error_t, Args...>,

- std::invocable<execution::just_error_t&, Args...>, and

- std::invocable<const execution::just_error_t&, Args...>.

Otherwise, no function call operator of execution::just_error_t participates in overload resolution.

### Notes

If the provided error is an lvalue reference, a copy is made inside the returned sender and a non-const lvalue reference to the copy is sent to the receiver’s set_error. If the provided value is an rvalue reference, it is moved into the returned sender and an rvalue reference to it is sent to the receiver’s set_error.
