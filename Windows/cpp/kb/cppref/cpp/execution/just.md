Call signature

execution::sender auto just( auto&&... values );

(since C++26)

A sender factory that returns a sender which completes immediately by calling the receiver’s set_value().

Let ts be a pack of subexpressions. The expression just(ts...) is expression-equivalent to /*make-sender*/(just, /*product-type*/(ts...))

### Customization point objects

The name execution::just denotes a customization point object, which is a const function object of a literal semiregular class type. The cv-unqualified version of its type is a tag type denoted as execution::just_t.

All instances of execution::just_t are equal. The effects of invoking different instances of type execution::just_t on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be invocable). Thus, execution::just can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to execution::just above, execution::just_t models

- std::invocable<execution::just_t, Args...>,

- std::invocable<const execution::just_t, Args...>,

- std::invocable<execution::just_t&, Args...>, and

- std::invocable<const execution::just_t&, Args...>.

Otherwise, no function call operator of execution::just_t participates in overload resolution.
