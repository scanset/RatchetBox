Defined in header <execution>

execution::sender auto

    let_value( execution::sender auto input,

std::invocable</*values-sent-by*/(input)...> function );

(since C++26)

### Parameters

input

-

sender which once executed sends the values upon which the function executes

function

-

invocable to be called with the values from the input sender

### Return value

Returns a sender describing the task graph described by the input sender, with an added node of invoking the provided function with the values sent by the input sender as arguments.

let_value is similar to then, however, where the sender returned from then sends exactly what that function ends up returning - let_value requires that the function returns a sender, and the sender returned by let_value sends the values sent by the sender returned from the callback.
