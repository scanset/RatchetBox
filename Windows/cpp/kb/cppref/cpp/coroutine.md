The coroutine support library defines several types that provide compile and run-time support for coroutines.

### Coroutine traits

Defined in header <coroutine> 

coroutine_traits

(C++20)

trait type for discovering coroutine promise types 
(class template)

### Coroutine handle

Defined in header <coroutine> 

coroutine_handle

(C++20)

used to refer to a suspended or executing coroutine 
(class template)

### No-op coroutines

Defined in header <coroutine> 

noop_coroutine

(C++20)

creates a coroutine handle that has no observable effects when resumed or destroyed 
(function)

noop_coroutine_promise

(C++20)

used for coroutines with no observable effects 
(class)

noop_coroutine_handle

(C++20)

std::coroutine_handle<std::noop_coroutine_promise>, intended to refer to a no-op coroutine 
(typedef)

### Trivial awaitables

Defined in header <coroutine> 

suspend_never

(C++20)

indicates that an await-expression should never suspend 
(class)

suspend_always

(C++20)

indicates that an await-expression should always suspend 
(class)
